# Identifying Patterns in Activity from “Men’s Rights” Subreddit Feeds

The bowels of the internet expelled what is know today as Incels, or the “involuntarily celibate”. After starting as a internet subculture with the intention of venting shared frustrations,the online community rapidly devolved into a petri dish of misogyny, racism, self-loathing and, calls to violence. As of 2020, Incels can be linked to four acts of mass murder and 45 total deaths. Given the violent nature of this online community that has incited violence offline, we proposebuilding a tool that makes text data from `r/TheRedPill`, `r/MGTOW` and `r/MensRights`. As two of these feeds are quarantined (`r/TheRedPill` and `r/MGTOW`), and all three feeds may contain sensitive content that could be triggering to some, our aim is to make these resources more accessible to enable the investigation of questions that require a deeper understanding of the online Incel community.
