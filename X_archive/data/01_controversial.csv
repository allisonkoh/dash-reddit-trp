Manspreaders will spread. Snowflakes will be triggered and Fats will be shamed. A lot of work goes into being a Red Pill College Superstar. You're going to have to sit through boring lectures, disable fire alarms, and learn important skills like herding sluts. No one said it was going to be easy. Luckily for you, I the wise and magnificent GayLubeOil, have chosen to help you. I have written The Ultimate Red Pill University Guide so that you can can become the manipulative Red Pill Alpha you were destined to be and more importantly so that you will [buy my shirts](http://teespring.com/gloalphashirt).

**Human Capital:**  Every second you spend in your dorm room squeezing your baby sausage, playing video games, or reading non-GayLubeOil posts on Reddit, is time wasted. Why? Because there are literally thousands of people walking around campus waiting for you to exploit them and that isn't going to happen if you're covered in  semen holding an Xbox controller. Human capital isn't built in isolation. Human capital is created by meeting people, figuring out their strengths, and bringing them into your frame. Human capital is what you are going to use to amass life's three most important resources: knowledge, money, and vagina. So get the fuck out of your dorm and go meet people until your phone is packed with names like Calculus Ken, Rim-job Rosana, and Trashy Tessa. 

**Slut Ranching:** Every person has a purpose. For sluts that purpose is taking dick. Sluts don't make good wives, girlfriends, or friends because taking strange dick is their top priority and supersedes any and all meaningful obligations. The other side of the equation is that most men are thirsty as fuck. Thirst supersedes logic. A man who thinks with his penis is not reasoning with his mind. Such  men are easy to exploit, just ask any purse, jewelry, or fur coat salesman. This is why slut ranching is so profitable. Men make horrible decisions in the presence of sluts. Which is why you should surround yourself with sluts and seek to profit off of lesser men. College campuses are packed with sluts. Try to friend-zone as many as you can, so you can herd them to social events. Bringing sluts is one of the fastest ways to build social value. It won't take long for men to start begging you to bring your sluts at which point you can name your price.


**Nerd Herding:** Unfortunately, there is more to university than finger blasting Sorority Samantha before shaking hands with her dad. University is all about grades. Grades are what are going to get you into grad school and postpone your entry into the job market until the coming off the Antichrist, at which point the economy won't matter anymore. So how the fuck are you supposed to get A's while taking classes like linear algebra and organic chemistry? Nerds. It's far easier to learn from nerds than [Professor Tunak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTIIMJ9tUc8) who only talks about shit that isn't on the test. Nerds digest the information for you, arrange it into neat outlines, and make studying way easier. Unfortunately, nerds aren't going to let you mooch indefinitely, you need leverage. Take your nerd to small social gatherings like barbecues, introduce him to the girl he's going to pedastlize. It's kind of like being a CIA handler or Steve jobs. As long as the nerd gives you what you need you give him what he needs. The second he stops being useful dump him like Steve Wozniak.

**Building Value:** While exploiting other people's value is awesome, it is important to have something of your own to bring to the table. Value takes many forms. Knowing how to mix good drinks is value. Grilling a great steak is value. Driving viewers to a web site is value. Value is contextual. To be successful you need to understand your value and how to get the best price for it. If you feel that you lack value you can always build it, especially if you are young. So get out there and utilize your value, build your value, or exploit other people's value. Anything is possible, especially if you are the kind of person who has no problem looking a man in the eye and firmly shaking his hand, after vigorously finger-blasting his daughter.

1,[PSA] Mad Max: is a ‘Feminist Action Film’ - Don't expect a masculine movie,0,0,0,35pkip,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/35pkip/psa_mad_max_is_a_feminist_action_film_dont_expect/,352,1431467047.0,"The movie will be marketed to men. But it isn't for men. It is feminist propaganda included into a masculine franchise.

quoting the TIME article https://archive.is/4yMZ0

> Here’s a surprise: Tom Hardy, a.k.a. Mad Max, isn’t the star of Mad Max: Fury Road. Charlize Theron is. An even bigger surprise? Vagina Monologues author Eve Ensler consulted on what turns out to be a very feminist film.

> ...

> [TIME] It’s a sort of sneaky feminism. When you say the premise—a woman warrior escapes with female sex slaves—that doesn’t necessarily sound like a blockbuster. But because it’s an action film, guys will see it. Something similar is happening with another summer film: Amy Schumer, who’s a really outspoken feminist comedian, is coming out with the rom-com Trainwreck. LeBron James is in the movie, which I think might lure men who might not otherwise go. Is that subversive feminism the best way to address women’s issues in film?

> [Ensler] One day, we won’t have to sneak it. One day we will be overt. One of the great things about this film is that when you have women on your side, you have a better chance of surviving. It’s clear that we’re all served better when women are equal. We don’t want to dominate. We just want our stories to be given equal consideration—to also get a spot on the playing field.

A masculine movie would not get such ratings. The perfect score is for it being feminist propaganda.

So if you want to see more feminist propaganda marketed as masculine action movie go see Fury Road. If not, at least wait for the first user reviews. A lot of men are going to be angry at being fooled into paying.",2015-05-12 21:44:07
2,Met girl in court. Used 2nd language. Fuck 1.5hrs later. Plate.,61,0,61,9j207x,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9j207x/met_girl_in_court_used_2nd_language_fuck_15hrs/,258,1537993378.0,"Edit: downvote and report brigade from haters had my post removed. Lol. 100% true without embellishment. 

-

---------

-

**Introduction**

-

The following report is (edit: the first) one of a few hangouts I've done with the same woman. We do 'date-like' things. Some of this will be in a small portion of a book I've been working on outlining the path from lone wolf cold approach to proximity and social circle game. The journey we've been on will illustrate several concepts I attempt to convey about attractive women and social circle game. This one encounter opened me up to a new world which I'll describe in later reports with her. 

-

Now let's begin...

-

----------------------------------
------------------------------------

**Body**

-

I was going through security at a courthouse when a hot foreign girl came in line behind me. Nice tits. She was accompanied by an older schlub. I could hear her speaking one of the two other languages I can speak, 'Language Y' (enough competence to flirt with women). I attempt at some small talk. 

-

**Me**: *""Why are you here? You a criminal?""*, smirk on my face

-

**Her**: *""No! Just paying for a speeding ticket.""*

-

I forgot what else I said, but further interaction required disruption of the security process, look desperate, and looks bad socially. I didn't detect enough interest to go further. Moved on.

-

I check for my name on the screens, go up stairs, and enter the courtroom. I choose to sit at the very back on the bench. There were a few others already waiting. Nothing happened for a few minutes. 

-

Suddenly, I spot a girl to my left entering the room, she appears to be of a race that speaks one of the other languages I speak. Let's call her 'Rachel'.  She's cute, has nice tits, and is wearing tights that show off some booty. Yum. She sits down two benches in front of me to the left, a few people-widths inside. There are two men behind her. I don't remember the exact conditions, but I do remember wondering if some of the people around her were family/friends. This made me pause for a bit to strategize my approach. Approach anxiety was kind of there, but that's never my problem. My issue is being able to navigate this context properly so that negative social mechanisms don't kick in and shutdown my operation. **A girl can be totally into you, but then she senses her image is at stake then withdraws completely and you look stupid. Has happened before**. 

-

Eventually I determine that there are no social roadblocks in my way. She is vulnerable for approach now. It won't get anymore convenient than this moment. No one's sitting to her left blocking the entrance to the bench, and no one to the right for more than 15 ft. The opportunity lingers. All I have to do is walk over there. My window is closing. Just one person can screw it all up. Rationalizations about why I shouldn't try are going through my head. But if I don't attempt now, I'll forever hate myself. Rejection is better than regret. I make my move.

-

As I enter the bench, I use the language (language X). 

-

**Me**: *""Excuse me. Is anybody sitting there?""* (Me pointing to her right)

-

**Rachel**: *""Oh. Uhmm, no.""*

-

I squeeze in front of her and sit two people spaces to the right of her so as to not come across too strong. Chill for a moment. Don't look at her.

-

**Me**: *""What are you doing here?""* (Language X)

-

**Rachel**: (Doesn't seem to understand)

-

**Me**: (Repeat myself with better annunciation)

-

Turns out she's here because of some altercation with a friend. 

-

(Here on out, our conversation is a mix of Language X and English because she can't speak a lot of English)

-

She inquires about my appearance here. I tell her I'm seeing if I'm going to jail. This creates bait for her to ask more questions about me, creating more investment. Also, I keep some mystery while mixing in some badboy. Oh did I tell you I have a 'badboy' look? 

-

**Rachel**: ""What did you do?""

-

**Me**: (I tell her)

-

She goes more into depth about her situation and can't understand her summons sheet (written in English). An IOI most certainly. I take this opportunity as an excuse to scoot closer to her. She's wondering if she's at risk of going to jail. The paperwork doesn't say so, she's just summoned to act as a witness to the crime she charged her friend for.

- 

She asks if I've ever been arrested other times. I don't hold back on my history and my shenanigans. If there's one thing I've learned, crime, even violent crime is a panty-wetter. I once jokingly said I just got back from court deciding my fate on a liquor store robbery me and my friends were accused of. ""Not guilty"". She ate that shit up. Attraction over 9000. Just went along with it to see where it goes. I buttered her up and screwed up later, but that's not relevant. 

-

**Rachel**: *""You're soooo bad""* teehee hehe.

-

We chill for a moment. But I can see her fidgeting. She looks nervous. I ask her what's wrong. She says she's nervous with a shy smile. She changed her mind, she doesn't want to charge her friend anymore. She doesn't want her to go to jail. I lean over, put my hand on her shoulder and tell her it will be alright. I was the one who might get sentenced, but wasn't nervous, and most certainly wasn't going to show it. I'm the rock now. 

-

She starts touching me while talking some more. Indirect permission to escalate granted. I put my arm around her on the seat, caressing her shoulder slightly. She looks completely comfortable with it, doesn't acknowledge it. Turns out her friend and her friends mother were sitting in the same row as us on the other side to the right, giving us dirty looks. All I said was fuck her, if a 'friend' did that to me, they can go fuck themselves. Left it at that. I've learned to not delve into the affairs of a woman's life, just let her vent and just listen.

-

Other cases are going on. A bunch of idiots trying to bullshit their way out of their D.U.Is and drug charges. I wasn't buying it. The judge most certainly wasn't. Even a security guard laughed at some of them. I translate some of that to her and make fun of them. She tells me I'm so mean. Eventually I ask if she has a pen. She doesn't and asks why.

-

**Me**: *""You're going to write your number on my paper (summons sheet)""* (No phones allowed in court)

- 

**Rachel**: *""Oh really?""*

-

**Me**: *""Yes""*

-

I ask the woman two seats over if she has a pen I can borrow. She does and I give it to Rachel. *Number acquired*. Then I remember a lesson I learned at a bar once, always ask about her logistics in the middle of your session, not towards the end when she gets drunk and things become out of your control and can't close. So I ask her how she got here. She says she took the bus. 

-

**Me**: *""Maybe I can drop you off. Where do you live?""*

-

**Rachel**: (she can't pronounce her English street name)

-

I realized her summons sheet has her address. Perfect.

-

**Me**: *""I live only 5 mins away from here, you're only around 20mins away. It's not a big deal; I can drop you off""*

-

**Rachel**: *""Yeah, sure""*

-

*Now, we're getting somewhere*.

-

Her time is coming near based on the amount of people left. She's still nervous, I still caress her. She asks me if I can come up to the podium with her for support (how cute and feminine. Now I really want to violate her). I tell her I can't, but that she'll do fine. 

-

Her time comes up. She walks to the stand. She keeps looking back at me while speaking.

**Judge**: *""Why do you keep looking back there""*

-

**Rachel**: (No answer, keeps talking)

-

**Me**: (She's looking back at Papa Warlock, that's what she's doing)


-

There's a camera here monitoring all of us, monitoring me running some smooth game. Oh yeah.

-

Case Verdict: Friend gets a $1000+ fine and a record, no jail time.

-

Rachel sits back with me with my arm around her instead of the chair (slight escalation). The mother comes to our side and speaks in front of us to Rachel in Language X. I only caught bits and pieces, but I can tell it was shaming. Turns out it was...

-

**Mother**: ~*""How could you do that to a friend?""* Blah blah blah excuses.

-

I laughed and told her fuck them. Don't worry about it. 

-

My Case: Reduced fine on the condition I don't get another conviction, no jail time because I got lucky for reasons not relevant.

-

We exit the room and start walking towards the parking garage. I make sure nothing can fuck this up. I've gotten too far to fail. We get there. She offers to pay and even gives me her debit card pin. I spray the car with febreeze and a hint of cologne before she got in. She liked it, didn't care about the mess. She stays in the car. I tell her I'm taking the keys just in case she's a car thief. Parking paid. Drive off to her house playing Language X music. I take videos of us driving singing and laughing for my IG story. Letting the other girls know Dr. Warlock still got it. She admits to having a baby. I just say 'oh'. Cute, older than 24. Someone already impregnated her? *Shocker*.

-

We arrive near her apartment and start walking. As an excuse to go inside, I say I'd like to see the baby. She says it's at her aunt's house nearby.

-

**Me**: *""Oh I thought it was at your house. Let's walk to yours first, maybe we'll do that later""*

-

We arrive at the building entrance.

-

**Me**: *""Can I use your bathroom?""*

-

**Rachel**: *""Sure, that's fine""*

-

We go inside. There's a rocking baby chair near the door. Turns out I do have some urine to drain. 

-

She walks towards her room and starts fumbling around, I take a peek.

-

**Rachel**: *""No no no. You can't look. It's messy!* hehe. 

-

She grabs my arm and asks if I want something to drink.  I say yes.

-

We go in and she starts cooking something while listening to some music on her phone. She begins swaying her hips and getting into the music. Signal received, sweety. I begin some slight dancing, slowly getting closer to her. I grab her hand and slowly pull her to me grabbing her hips. I can feel those big tits on me. She turns herself around and starts grinding on me. I put my face in the crook of her neck and kiss her cheek. She puts my hands on her tits and starts kissing me. Insert make-out sesh and me grabbing some ass. No resistance at all. I pick her up and place her on the kitchen counter, telling her we should do it right here in the kitchen.

-

**Rachel**: *""You're so baaaad. Teehee. Not here, people can see!""*

-

We break away and smile at each other. I get into a more casual mood and say hey, let's check out your room.

-

**Her**: *""Why? What are we going to do there?""*

-

I ignore her and start walking out the kitchen. She follows me. I go in and it's small and indeed messy. There's a baby crib at the foot of her bed. I don't give a shit. Not my kid , not my problem, not my house, I'm getting some booty. 

-

She walks in all embarrassed. I tell her I don't care, then pick her up and throw her onto the bed, me on top of her. 

-

**Rachel**: *""Omg, I just met you and we're already doing this!""*

-

**Me**: *""Shhhhh""*, and start kissing her. She's very enthusiastic. 

-

I start rubbing her vagina above the pants, no resistance and I can feel she's wet. So I go in under the pants, no resistance and start fingering her. At one point, she, on her own volition, starts removing her yoga pants. I can smell her pussy, that smell when it's really wet and ready to go. We get to business. I felt like a Chad, rubbing it in all the faces on the blue pill sub and every guy that says my tactics are wrong and doesn't work. Just met this girl 1.5 hours ago in court, looking like trouble, and already fucking. She turned for doggy, I go to town. There's a big mirror in front of the bed. I stare at myself thrusting. I think of the [American Psycho scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXNCcWPUkBA). Oh, yeah. 

-

I tell her to suck my dick. She happily obliges. She was sucking like a porn star, purposely gagging on it. 

-

She said, *""Tell me how to please you. I want to see you cum""*. Man, I'm liking this girl already.

-

Anyways... business done and we're just lying down. She's tired. Apparently, she texted one of her friends that she met some guy at court and sent a pic. Now her friend is like ""omg I can't believe you let a strange guy into your house. You're so bad"". At this point I was on full alert. In an attempt to prevent any ASD bullshit, I told her to tell her I only came into the use the bathroom and left in a light-hearted way. She agreed. Whew. 

-

Edit: She told me this was crazy. We're in a court room. Its not appropriate to try. She thought I was cute but didn't think I would walk over and talk to her. She liked the fact that I didn't care. All in cute broken English. 

-

She wants to get dressed and go back into the kitchen. 

-

**Me:** *""No clothes allowed. I wanna see your body some more""*

-

**Rachel**: *""So you're my boss?* , teehee (English)

-

**Me**: *""Yes, I'm your boss""* (Language X)

-

Before she gets off the bed, I spank her ass.

-

She tidies up in the bathroom naked, but her kitchen windows have no covers so she puts some clothes on. I don't bother. We walk to the kitchen and I'm naked.

-

**Rachel**: *""Omg my neighbors and probably see you""*

-

**Me**: *""I don't care, let them watch""*

-

I have a good physique. No shame whatsoever.

-

We chat for a bit. I get dressed. Tell her I'll text her later. Leave.

-

Parts 2+ coming soon to forum near you.

**Lessons Learned**

 * Learn a another language of a people whose women you find attractive. Foreign women > [American Woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzWHE32IxUc), even of the same color. School only gives you basics, is slow, and not much else. For proficiency, have a translator app on your phone, and you need to work around people that speak it or go to school/work abroad. Don't lie to yourself, you learned it to get pussy. 

 * My 'What are you doing here? Are you a criminal?' line was an intentional opener. It's accusatory in a fun way and gets her justify herself immediately. Has worked many times while a strange girl walked by me on the street, just not this time. 

 * Be aware of context. You liking her and her interested in you is not enough. Always be aware of the social situation. A girl can be totally into you, but then she senses her image is at stake then withdraws completely or even throws you under the bus. 

 * The best opportunities often occur when you're not looking for them. They happen so fast and often not at the best convenience. Act fast or the window will close. Rejection is better than regret. 

 * Criminal activity is never a negative for getting pussy. Neutral and often positive. Get arrested in front of a girl, committing crimes with her/in front of her, whatever, she likes it but often doesn't know it yet. Criminals often get the easiest and best pussy. That includes the 'sweet innocent' ones. Yo momma, yo daughter, yo sister, and yo wife. Not advocating crime, just telling you how it is.

 * You HAVE to be able to recognize indirect signs of interest and receptiveness to escalation. They are almost always INDIRECT. This girl asked me to help her read her summons sheet, that requires you to scoot closer. Don't mention it, just act. 'Just get it'. 

 * When she's nervous and uneasy or scared, you have to keep your cool. *""To be like a rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it""* – Marcus Aurelius. Let her flail around like a flag on a pole during a windy day, then return to rest. She'll thank you for it, I promise. Often in the form of pussy. You can hold her, shutup and just listen. Let her go through the emotional tide. That's all you need. That's what they consider, 'taking care of them'. 

 * When relocating for the bang, make sure you have everything in order. Check your pockets. Don't let others distract you or her from your rendezvous. Don't rush.

 * Don't delve into the affairs of a woman's life in search for a solution, just let her vent and listen. She's talking to you to vent, [she don't wanna be saved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJn87TkZF38). Bite your tongue if you have to. 

 * Women and clueless men think this mating ritual process 'just happens'. My ass. It's methodical. You have to think two steps ahead and make the next move. She won't do it for you. Get creative if you have to and be persistent. 

 * Always ask about her logistics in the middle of your session, not towards the end when she gets drunk and things become out of your control and can't close. Driving a girl home is a perfect excuse to go into her place. 

 * If she's hot, is over ~23-25, she has a kid, guarantee. Guys have been busting nuts inside her since she was in 9th grade, maybe earlier, like nature intended. One of those sperm was bound to find its place. Expect it. 

 * Remember her dancing in the kitchen? This a female tactic. They put themselves in a position to receive male escalation attempts and see what happens. They don't think further than that much of the time. It's your job to identify this and make a move. ",2018-09-26 20:22:58
3,So you're new to the Red Pill & think that we hate women? Think again...,66,0,66,1sms6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1sms6j/so_youre_new_to_the_red_pill_think_that_we_hate/,205,1386797888.0,"I've always said that the one group of people who truly take away women's agency are feminists. Why? Because it has forced the concept of ""womanhood"" into being *one* thing only: like a man. 

On the other hand, TRP *recognizes*, *accepts* & then takes *advantage* of the true nature of women. We don't try to change it. *""Omgz but you guyz hate womyn!!!""*. We may not find some of the things women do enjoyable, but we still accept them (no matter how hard; that's why swallowing the TRP for some is difficult) and learn to game the system to get laid. We overcome anything we may find annoying in them and we *plow forward*. What a novel concept: recognizing & then ignoring the shit you don't like (instead of whining about like feminists) and still getting what you want in the end.

Most of all, we encourage *true* femininity (in the biological sense) and don't try to redefine women as men. Leaders, breadwinners, independent, directly competitive/challenging, solely-focused. Those characteristsics are not feminine, no matter how you look at it, and no woman should be forced to be that *if she doesn't want to*. On the other hand, if she does want to, then good for her. But I sure as hell don't have to call her ""beautiful"", make an effort to sleep with her, or even talk to her. Stop saying I do. 

As for women who sleep around, cheat, lie to their bfs & are selfish, we certainly post lots of crap about them and criticize that behavior (does anyone praise liars?). But ultimately, we as men *must* recognize it's a dog-eat-dog world and we're not entitled to keeping our pussy on a leash. Instead, we take care of our shit, and *that* is what keeps our pussy coming back for more. On the other hand, mainstream culture will slut-shame any woman who *chooses* on her own to give it up ""easy"" to a guy. Her choice, don't judge or find someone for yourself to fuck. Yet tell that to the feminist at the bar who got left alone standing with her gin+tonic. Here in TRP, sluts are good. Show me a ""slut"" and I'll show you a girl I take to my bed and actually spend time on. Just I am not spending *all* my time on her, unless she earns it.

Lastly, feminism needs to recognize the cognitive dissonance it promotes in women. And men. It encourages masculine traits in girls (and them shames them if they don't accept) and promotes masculinity as a pathology in boys who don't know any better. No, that little boy isn't some ADHD mental case to be shunned just because he is solely focused on mechanical things and isn't interested (or good at) group presentation projects in home economics class. Boys and girls learn differently.

Finally, I would like to leave you all with a quote from ""The Devil's Advocate"" regarding TRP's view towards women (with the genders switched to reflect my point):

> I cared about what she wanted and I never judged her. Why? Because I never rejected her, in spite of all her imperfections! I’m a fan of women! I’m a feminist. Maybe the last feminist.

#9 Mistakes These Candidates Made In Their Interview

Something about a community centre draws the most interesting candidates. I'm going to tell you the story of three wholly different people. We had:

- An Italian Sexologist
- A Prison Social Worker
- An Ex-Lawyer turned Hospice Carer

The interviews are in a small room. Including me, there are 6 interviewers all asking questions to the candidates. Our first application is the Italian Sexologist.
He's got a hipster haircut and an interesting interviewing strategy.

#**Mistake #1: Not Backing Up Esoteric Knowledge**

Mr. Italian Sexologist starts immediately leveraging his academic background. He talks about how he has rare in-depth knowledge of Sexology. How he’s a trained and qualified sexologist. And starts dropping esoteric academic terms.

A few board members are impressed by this. But the chairman digs deep and he has trouble backing up his claim. The DHV fails. It might have been because of his bad English, but it didn’t leave a good impression.

**Fix: Clearly explain your esoteric knowledge or else it’ll look like BS**

#**Mistake #2: Not Engaging the Panel of Interviewers**

The interview continues and Mr. Italian makes another big mistake. He only engages the person that asked him the question. As there are 6 people here, the other 5 start to get really bored. At the end of the interview, only 1 out of the 6 liked him. Connect to everyone.

**Fix: Don’t solo in on one person, engage everyone.**

#Mistake #3: Telling Boring Stories 

He gives boring stories. In interviews, your employers want to hear how you’ll make their company even better, save them money, and build their reputation. To discern this, they ask you questions. Questions where you answer with fascinating stories of how you made your company better, saved them money, and built their reputation are what they want!

This guy desperately needed a storytelling 101 class. In University, my favourite class that I ever took was a beginner intro to screenwriting. Mostly because the professor was an acclaimed Hollywood writer that made every class fascinating. Now at interviews, I tell exciting stories that draw everyone in. 

Mr. Italian Sexologist told stories that were flat and boring.

**Fix: Tell exciting stories about how you improved your company.**

#**Mistake #4: Not Using Anyone's Names**

The Italian Sexologist also didn't use anyone’s name… This is so important. Obviously, since there are 6 people it’s a challenge but do not move on until you’ve remembered each person’s name. Out of all the three candidates, none of them did this. It's a big deal. Each time I asked the interviewee a question I used his name. It helps them pay attention to your question. Dale Carnegie in How to Win Friends and Influence people makes this his #1 rule.

**Fix: Use your interviewer’s name.**

#**Mistake #5: Have Jeb Bush Low-Energy**

No, we’re talking about the prison social worker. While she had an excellent interview overall, it could have been better. Her mistake was that she entered with very low energy. It was like what I imagine what it's like to talk to Jeb Bush.

And she refused to take off her coat… Very odd, but halfway through the interview she warms up and nails it. And because she went after the Italian sexologist, she looked like an All-Star when really she was just okay.

**Fix: Come in with high energy.**

#**Mistake #6: Fail to Smile and Be Friendly**

Now we’ve come to the Ex-Lawyer. This guy should have been the best candidate but he made some dumb mistakes that made him almost lose the job. He was the smartest, hardest working candidate. He was 6’4, jacked, ex-rugby captain, upper-class background with a law degree.

His big mistake was that he was so stoic. He never smiled. And because he was so big, he physically scared the interviewers. I’m great at picking up on body language but you didn’t have to be an expert to notice this. Hardly anyone but me would actually look at the guy if he wasn’t talking to you. 

**Fix: Smile and be friendly, aloofness works for girls but not for interviews**

#**Mistake #7: Be Monotone**

Now the Ex-lawyer is also monotone. He’s hard to listen to. And this big scary guy is also boring. That’s a bad combination.

**Fix: Use vocal variation in your interview answers to keep your audience interested.**

#**Mistake #8: Make Your Potential Boss Look Bad**

The ex-lawyer out alpha’d the director. This is a huge mistake. That why Robert Greene wrote in the 48 laws of power, that law #1 is to never outshine the master. His law background, his accomplishment, his physical presence, made the director look like a skinny beta loser.

And the director did not like this. He was really against hiring the guy because he felt so outdone and maybe a little emasculated around him. No one wants to hire someone who makes you look bad. So make sure to position yourself below your interviewer.

This was why he almost didn’t get hired. But another smart director and I realized this guy’s potential and helped convinced the other director to get him hired.

**Fix: Compliment the director and position him above you**

#Mistake 9: Too Vanilla

You fail to polarize yourself. This one is counter-intuitive but you want to show your interviewers that you’re different. You want to make them remember you amongst all the other candidates.

I learned this from Peter Thiel in his book, Zero to One. He writes that this is his favourite interview question is this:

>“What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”

This always gets good answers from candidates. But bad answers will sink your case. For instance, The Italian Sexologist answered that he believes that it’s bad to spread false information about sex. I inquired further but he couldn’t give any specific examples...

Whereas the prison social worker said she heavily believed in the law of attraction. And the ex-lawyer said he believed that moderation is the underrated way to succeed in life and gave good examples from his life as a career-driven lawyer.

**Fix: Believe in something slightly controversial (context is everything, cherry-pick your answers for your audience).**

#How to Nail Every Interview: The Briefcase Strategy

This is a game changer. And it creates the best impression in all your interviewers. I learned this from Ramit Sethi and this is probably some of his best advice.

[Watch his video explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=19&v=68dqa_IPqK8)

Here’s the gist:

The context is that you’re about to go in for your first interview. They’re trying to get a feel for you. And eventually, they ask you think the company should do differently to increase sales or accomplish their objective.

This is the moment where the magic happens.

Instead of going into a long monologue, you pull out a 2-6 page report detailing exactly everything you would do for the company.

This WOWS your interviewer. I’m sure some redpillers can testify to this if they’ve used this or seen it. I’ve used this for every interview I’ve had for the past year and it’s magical.

The briefcase strategy works because it shows you’re prepared to help the company succeed. And you’ve clearly thought about how to do it.

But with this approach, there’s one mistake you must avoid. I say that because I made this mistake and it cost me the job.

#**The Big Mistake I Made When Using the Briefcase Strategy**

Now this is an advanced mistake, that no one even attempted at the interview. But it's important to know when you start using this.

I was applying for two different marketing jobs. I used two polar opposite strategies and I learned a lesson that I’ll never forget.

The first one I walk in. I’m quite good at interviews because I’m great with small groups in private settings. I use lots of eye-contact. Use their name. Engage everyone. Tell good stories. I’m quite good. I delight them with  marketing campaign proposals tailored to their business. But there are some mistakes you can’t forgive… Because at the end of the day, they want to know you’ll make them more money.

**Company #1:**

The interview is going really well. But I make an embarrassing mistake. I tell them I’ll increase their email list by 100 subscribers in the first month. Even thinking about this hurts because they were probably growing their email list by 50 new people just organically. So to invest thousands of dollars in a new worker with that little return would be an awful investment for them.

But for some reason, I thought I had to be conservative about my first-month results to not disappoint them if I didn't meet my quota. But that's useless if I didn't get the job.

Good marketing is making the **BOLD** promises and doing everything you can to keep those promises. So I didn’t get the job, but I fixed this mistake for my next interview.

**Company #2:**

Here’s how I fixed this in the next interview:

I entered with boldness. I title my whole marketing campaign for them, “How I’ll Double Your Revenue.” Obviously, that was very optimistic but they loved it. And I got the job. I still freelance for them today.

**Fix: Make BOLD promises to improve the company**

*****

#Lessons Learned:

Interviews are easy. They come down to being confident and showing your interviewer why hiring you will be the best decision they’ve made in the last year. No one’s perfect and we all get nervous. For some highly competitive jobs, you need to be on your game and really practice before hand. For others, if there’s low competition and you kill it. Simply avoid the mistakes I’ve listed and use the briefcase strategy--you will easily be the favoured candidate. To sum it all up.

**1. For Interviews do this:**

1. Back up esoteric knowledge
- Engage everyone
- Your stories should centre on how you helped improved your previous company
- Use your interviewer’s name
- Come in with High Energy
- Smile and be friendly
- Use vocal variation in your answers
- Don’t outshine the master
- Be selectively controversial


**2. Use the Briefcase Strategy: bring in a written report on what you'll do to improve the company the interview.**

**3. Make Bold Promises.**

5,A Beginners Guide To Using Steroids Safely,30,0,30,8savnj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8savnj/a_beginners_guide_to_using_steroids_safely/,312,1529459276.0,"....Or as safe as you can. I should say. 

Okay this is a little off the normal topic of things. But i was suggested to post about it by one of the mods. and let's face it lifting is such a main focus on this sub that it's stupid not to think some guys aren't going to want to try gear or at least be curious. I'm not condoning the use of steroids especially if it is not legal where you live or without doctor supervision, natty is always the better and safer way to go. This is strictly for education purposes and my personal experience. I have used gear and also couch others on it. You wouldn't believe the lack of knowledge and research people have on the topic. Especially guys who jump right in and do everything wrong without any research. If run properly you can have great benefits especially at an older age and run as TRT (testosterone replacement therapy). I'm going to get really basic with this just to inform people who are curious but have little to no knowledge. 

**Word of knowledge** 

Everyone's body is different. One compound may give me great results while another may give you all side effects. 

With that being said, this is mostly a trial and error of what works best for YOU in particular. The reason I say this is because when I first started I wanted the perfect cycle. The problem is everyone's ""perfect cycle"" is different. And if you search the Internet on this stuff. Your head will explode because 100 people will tell you a 100 different ways to run something. And the way you're doing it is wrong and their way is right. But you don't know shit about these people or what they look like. So listen to your body. And know that  more isn't always better. 

**Basic as it gets**

Although this is a very broad topic I'm going to try to educate you as best as I can without bombarding you with every little detail. Pretty much an ELI5 without giving my personal opinion too much. 

Injecting. make sure you learn proper and safe sterile techniques. But injecting is the way to go. If you are planning on just taking orals. I would say don't waste your money. Because you will lose everything almost as soon as you stop. And it is very hard on the liver to run for long periods of time. 

Although I said everyone's perfect cycle is different. The best and safest first cycle IMO. Is just taking a low dose of testosterone. A low dose would be about 250-300mg a week. Most guys run 500-600mg their first cycle.  The right way is to try to maximize off the lowest amount possible. 

Testosterones have different esters. This means how long they take to leave the body once absorbed. Short esters hold less water, long esters hold more but allow you to inject a lot less. A longer ester is a better choice for your first cycle. Longer esters include test Cypionate and test enanthate. They take about 4 weeks til you really start to notice what you're working with. But you will gain weight with in the first couple weeks. Mostly water weight 

**Labs and A.I.s** 

You should always get bloodwork done. Before your cycle to see what your normal levels are. 6 weeks in to see how you're reacting to the drugs. And after you stop to see how long it takes for your levels to return to normal. 

A.I.s are aromatase inhibitors they are used to keep your estrogen levels at bay. When you put synthetic test into your body your test levels will obviously rise. The testosterone then converts into estrogen. So you will have high estrogen. Because of this you should always run a mild A.I. Like arimadex  about 2 weeks into your cycle to keep your estrogen at bay. This will prevent estrogen sides and bloating. And Just because you don't experience high estrogen sides (gyno aka man boobs) doesn't mean you don't have high estrogen. 

Aromasin and letrozole (strongest) are stronger A.I.s they actually kill estrogen in the body. You need some estrogen but you don't want it too high or at 0. That is why arimadex is usually used first. If you start to get high estrogen sides. Like sensitive nipples. It's smart to try a stronger A.I. 

**HCG** 

Human chorionic gonadotropin

Should be taken during you cycle also. This prevents your body from shutting down its natural test production. The old school way was to run it in your post cycle. But it's better to run it during and after. It's more of preventing your balls from shutting down (especially if you want kids) then Recovery from them being shut down and running it just post cycle. 

**PCT**

Post cycle therapy 

The name of the game is time on = time off. The amount of time you spend on cycle is the same amount of time you should spend off to allow your body to recover. Most cycles last 12-16 weeks. Sometimes longer. Sometimes sorter. It's all preference.  

A good post cycle therapy is running nolvdex. Clomid. And hcg. 

These drugs allow the body to recover. By kick starting your balls to produce test naturally again and preventing estrogen sides. 

They also allow your body to help maintain what you have worked so hard for. 

Some guys especially over the age of 40 never come off test and do a pct. they do what is called ""blasting and cruising"" blasting would be upping their test dose and/or adding other compounds. Cruising would be considered as their ""time off"" but instead of coming off they just lower their test dose to about a 250mg a week dose (varies). As you get older your testosterone naturally declines so men use this as a test replacement therapy for their natural test (where the term TRT comes from). This is also known to have many good health benefits. 

**other compounds**

After you have ran a cycle of just test one or two times and you have no adverse effects you can add in other compounds. There are a variety of them that all do different things. Have different benefits and sides. It's smart to only add one in at a time so if you have an adverse effect you know exactly what is causing it. 

Orals are usually used to kick start a cycle or end one, because of how fast they are in and out of the body. Most of them are hard on the liver but are very effective. 

Steroids although most of them speed up your metabolism. They do not directly burn fat like most people thing. You may lose fat but it isn't their main purpose. Diet is still very very important when taking steroids. I know guys who run all types of Shit and look worst than most natty guys. Genes, diet, and training play a major major role in how good your results are. They allow you to recover fast and better utilize the food you put in your body. But they are no super magic pill like society programs us to believe. You still need to put in the work and diet. You can get away with more than someone who doesn't use. But you can still look like Shit if you don't bust your ass. 

Fat burners are compounds such as DNP, clen, t3 and t4. These compounds are used to burn fat and have no direct effect on muscle growth really. 

**wait as long as you can to go this route**

It's very bad for your body to start running roids at 18 years old. Allow your body to fully develop and reach your natural potential before thinking about trying this stuff. If you are looking to compete this is eventually a route you're probably going to have to take but wait as long as you can to do it. 

I hope this gives you some idea of what is involved in a cycle. Like I said there's a lot of information out there in it. This is the very very basic. Do your research and consult your doctor before taking anything. 

Edit:

It is also good to note that just taking orals alone is probably a waste of your money you are likely to lose almost everything once you have stopped taking them.

**-Dad**

***

I was 5 when I threw sand in some girl's face in retaliation (she threw sand in mine.) She started crying.

The girl's dad, an unemployed welfare hick, came to the fence separating our property-

*""I'm gonna come over this fence and beat your son's ass!""*

My dad is standing in front of me-

**""If you come over that fence, I'll rip your fucking head off and shit down your windpipe.""**

I remember the look on my dad's face- determination, his eyes wide but fierce, almost crazy in fact. His jaw was locked, his fist clinched whilst I clung to his leg. He looked lethal- like a gun ready to go off. 

The guy never did come over that fence.

***

Growing up, I was scrawny and weak. Picked on, and half the time I deserved it. Big mouth, annoying, weird. I would stick up for my friends and promptly get the shit kicked out of me. I didn't even put up a good fight. The most damage I ever did to another person was a bite on the leg after being jumped by three kids. When I opened my swollen eyes to see why the punches stopped after I sunk my teeth in, I looked up to see that the person I bit was the adult who came to my rescue the house over. I bit the guy who saved me.

***

3 years ago, I signed up at a BJJ gym. I put my time in. I left that gym and signed up for an MMA gym 2 years ago. I'm now one of the instructors at my gym.

I convinced my step brother to sign up 6 months ago. ""Don't you want better for yourself?"" I asked him. He signed up.

4 months ago, whilst he's lifting weights, he sees a girl who's also lifting and wrestling. She has muscles in all the right places. Fit, pretty, HB8 by my standards but an SMV of 4. He tells another gym-mate, ""Who is that? She's pretty!""

The person he told was one of the amateur fighters at our gym. He is unemployed and is all-in on his, so far, lackluster fighting career. He's 24, this is it for him.

He's also the boyfriend of this girl.

*""That's my fucking girlfriend.""*

My step brother apologizes, tells him he didn't know, and steers clear of both thereafter.

***

2 months ago- I'm coming out of the gym and invite one of my gym-mates out to pizza with my step brother.

AmateurFighter overhears.

*""Hey bro, I like pizza! Also, you have a step brother?""*

I smile, and respond-

**""Yeah, my step brother is __!""**

He frowns, and gets a serious look on his face.

""*Oh, that fucking guy! Why hasn't he been coming to the gym to get fucked up? Tell him I'm looking for him.""*

I smile again, throwing warmth in my eyes and using a higher tone than I'd care to-

**""Oh, he's injured and has been taking a break. But no worries on the whole girlfriend thing, I handled it and now he knows!""**

""*Tell him I'm looking for him.""* He repeated.

**""Well bud, don't look too hard!""** I responded with a smile, before driving away.

***

I'm sitting at the pizza place with my step brother. We're going over RP truths. I believe we were talking about value and physical fitness. I was theorizing how sexual strategy was a two sided coin, you can either game women through subterfuge or you could be skilled enough to physically challenge your competition. Either should, in theory, give women the tingles.

I look over to my step brother, and I tell him about what had transpired at the gym before I came to the pizza parlor. AmateurFighter had injured 2 other fighters over the years over perceived slights against his relationship, he had made many more threats. He had a reputation. He had pushed one of the instructors over an alleged *leer* towards his girlfriend.

**""Don't worry, brother. You're family. I have your back.""** I was thinking back upon my father's old saying: he had just gone to the hospital again the day prior. There was no guarantee he would make it at this time.

**""You and my dad are all I have in this world.""** I thought back to my dad's words. I had nothing to lose, all I could think about was my father and how close I was to losing him. 

I see a familiar car pull up in the parking lot.

AmateurFighter had arrived, uninvited.

My step brother becomes apprehensive- *""oh shit.""* He says with some concern.

**""Don't worry, I'll handle it.""** I assure him.

AmateurFighter throws open the door. His gait is with purpose, his face has the look of a man looking for a fight. He doesn't even look at me, his eyes are fixated on my step brother.

I smile, add warmth to my eyes, I throw my hands out and say in a high voice, **""hey, AmateurFighter! I don't remember inviting you!""**

No acknowledgment. He comes up behind my step brother, he forcefully places his hand on the nape of his neck. He leans in, *""hey man, you said something pretty disrespectful about my girlfriend-""*

I shot out of the seat in a flash. I knocked over the tables and chairs. I secured a cross-collar grip on his jacket with my forearm against his throat. I pushed him against the wall.

**""This isn't the fucking place for that.""** I growled, my voice resuming it's natural deep Bass that I normally hide. My eyes bore into him with a wild-eyed look, not unlike my father's back in the day.

He threw his hands up. His eyes darted around in visible fear. He didn't respond, he didn't move. His eyes never met mine throughout the exchange.

**""If I wanted you here, I would've given you a fucking invite. Now get the fuck out of here.""** I finished. 

The staff rushed over, attempting to separate us. It was like time stood still. The whole room had been enveloped in my frame. I released him and the staff proceeded to escort him out, threatening police. I proceeded to sit back down to finish my pizza and beer, and continue my conversation with my step brother. In spite of me being asked to leave, the staff didn't push the issue and I remained unmolested for the rest of the night.

I looked over to my step brother and clasped his hand with mine. I looked him in the eye-

**""You had my word that I had your back.""**

**""One day, I may need you stand for me, much like I did for you today. I may become injured and weak""**

**""That guy won't let this go. His ego won't stand for it. So you better learn how to defend yourself, because I won't always be around.""**

**""But lucky for you, and unlucky for him, I was here. He put his hand on the stove and he got burned.""**

He acknowledges this, and we finish talking about TRP without further issue.

***

As I walk out, I see the AmateurFighter and the gym-mate I had invited earlier hanging out down the ways, waiting for us to leave. I expected the worst.

**""Get in the car and leave, bro.""** I command. He reluctantly obliges, still mindful of his injuries from the week previous during training.

I walk over to the group. I felt relaxed but wound-up. I was calm and I had a sense of certainty. Fear, something I would normally feel when I was younger, was strangely absent.

I felt lethal, but I was also mindful that I needed to be functional for my dad's sake. Regardless, in my mind, there was only one way this situation would go if it came down to it.

AmateurFighter starts talking.

*""Dude, ketogainsmongoose, I'm sorry. I came here to talk to you!""*

**""Don't bullshit me, AmateurFighter, you came here looking to cause problems for my step brother. You put his hands on him. You simply expected me to stand by, but you put your hand on the stove and got burned, now you're trying to pretend you weren't here to fuck him up.""**

*""He disrespected my girlfriend! She doesn't know what just happened in there! I asked her if she was offended, and she said yes! I asked if she wanted an apology, she said yes! I was just gonna have him come outside and apologize to her!""*

**""Bullshit. You came in with anger on your face and in your heart. You put your hands on him. You violated man's law. You disrespected me by coming here.""**

*""But I thought you invited me!""*

**""How the hell would you figure that?""**

*""You said 'don't look too hard!' that wasn't an invite?""*

I laugh.

**""You're an idiot. That was a threat. I was trying to hint to you to back the fuck off.""**

*""But my girlfriend wanted an apology!""*

**""Fuck your girlfriend, and fuck her apology.""**

I see a shadow move in the passenger side of his car. The girlfriend has been sitting in the car this whole time, listening to this exchange, without me realizing it.

***

I walked away unmolested that night. In a fit of rage, AmateurFighter had confronted our coach, the owner, at the gym over another issue regarding the girlfriend ""being harassed."" This time she alleged that she was 'touched' inappropriately by another instructor and waited a week to report it. A view of the cameras inside proved the allegation was false. When Coach told him as much, AmateurFighter pushed him to the ground.

The coach, knowing what had transpired with me and AmateurFighter the week before, banned both AmateurFighter and his girlfriend, and threatened him with police.

***

Some amongst the viewership question the authenticity of the field reports and stories posted on TRP as of late.

I'm here to tell you why you're simply a pussy-ass bitch who deserves your boring, uneventful, unfulfilling life.


Every single day, opportunities present themselves for you to drop the facade and be a man. Here it comes! Your chance to actually have something *unbelievable* happen in your life! A situation that would make your friends shake their heads in disbelief and say, ""bullshit, I don't believe you!""

And every single time, you choke.

You see other men, being men, and rationalize it as bullshit. Because the bitter truth, that you're simply a coward, is too hard for you to swallow.

You hamster away opportunities to show the world and yourself what you're made of.

""I need this job.""

""It's not worth the hassle.""

""Karma will get him.""

""One day, he'll mess with the wrong guy.""

""He's not worth it.""

""He's just lucky I can control my temper.""

""If *insert ideal conditions here* then I'd show him!""

You're just a pussy That's all there is to it. You're afraid to speak your piece because you're afraid of all the things you'd lose in your life.

Your job.

Your house.

Your bills.

Your car.

Your girlfriend.

Your wife.

Your kids.

And on and on it goes.

Those who would trade their self-respect for security, will neither be safe nor will they receive respect.

If you can't stand up to the random petty Tyrants riddled along your path in life, how the hell are you supposed to stand up for yourself when it matters?

If you don't take a stand now, you'll never catch up to those who trudged along, ignoring the crabs that attempted to pull them down.

Stop being a crab. Start being a man. Get your ass out of the house and stand for something.

Quit making excuses for why today just isn't the day to stand up for yourself.

If a man has enemies, that's good! It means he actually stood for something in his life.

If you're tired of looking in the mirror and seeing a doormat, dig in your heels and start being a man for a change.

Go out there and live life.

Just wanted a quick vent. Also, reminder that reddit is not your friend. I saw they recently added a ""chat"" feature on here. (Or maybe that RES?). Do NOT trust that your conversations are safe there.  Assume admin can (and do) read them. Don't message me, I won't reply.

[Link removed. If you want to see it, PM me. For those who have received the link, pass it along to your friends who you deem worthy. This is how we spread.]

I'm going to be heading this up personally and fully intend for this to someday become a legitimate fraternity or private organization you'll be able to join in colleges around the country. Consider this my contribution towards bursting the misandry bubble. 

For the time being I envision this serving as a replacement for PUA ""lairs"" and a kind of red pill Fight Club where we can meet in real life to coordinate events and mentor one another. Saying you're going to a fraternity meeting is orders of magnitude more acceptable and low-key that using all the PUA and TRP community lingo that can set off red flags in people who are still plugged in. 

Ultimately I want to create local chapters around the country for men who have like-minded ideals and have taken the red pill to be able to experience the kind of camaraderie I enjoyed in my military and PUA days. 

And on that note, one of the main causes of me wanting to do this was when Meetup decided in their infinite wisdom to start deleting all of the PUA groups that had sprung up over the years. Having an official fraternity is under the radar in a variety of ways and I think long term will legitimize red pill philosophy and give it a push to becoming more mainstream as our philosophy spreads openly in the public, even if we don't call ourselves Red Pill or use familiar terms.

9,Jordan Peterson is not your friend.,0,0,0,7v4afp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7v4afp/jordan_peterson_is_not_your_friend/,359,1517743204.0,"Every once in a while, some new tradcon cock enters the public eye, and all the recovering betas here cannot forebear relapsing into their old ways and wrapping their lips around it for a good hard suck. 

If tradcon shit was the Red Pill, why does the Red Pill exist? Why was this wonderful, perfect tradcon world of justice, health, strength, freedom, and the right way of doing shit so soundly and thoroughly defeated by feminism in a couple of decades? 

Why? Because tradcon values are none of these things, they are shit, they always were shit, and it's very easy for slaves to replace one master with another. Tradcons do not give a shit about your welfare. They are just fighting with feminism over who gets to hold your leash.

When feminism first came along, why the men buy into it? 

Because they thought it would free them. They thought that the chains would be struck from their own natural and healthy sexual appetites if only women were ""liberated"" to be sluts. Why would they have gone for that, if they were already free and happy?

No, tradcons may [hate feminism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw1lthwHn9U) and [cultural Marxism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDggKqt3KA), but **The enemy of your enemy is not your friend. He is your enemy's enemy, nothing less and nothing more.**

The *reason* tradcons hate these things is not because they want you to be free, but because those chains get in the way of the ones *they* want you to wear. Chains like [marriage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFEyHNqK4Nc) to some ho. Chains like [absolutist morality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwi9Q9apHGI), as sold with the [superstitions of a bunch of bronze-age sheep herders](https://www.biblegateway.com/), and who gives a fuck [whether you are getting anything in exchange for all this righteousness](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3ax9rs/trees/). 

They don't give a fuck about you. They just want you pulling their ideological wagon instead of someone else's. Tradcons and feminists can fight their little war over whose plan to exploit you for women's sake is ""better"", and you don't have to be involved. Because if you actually take the Red Pill, instead of just longing for a [low-T, shrill, pencilnecked right-wing intellectual to suck up to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEi4_HcOcLA), then this what you already know:

* You belong to you. 
* You exist for you. 
* Anyone who wants something from you had better offer you something in exchange, instead of trying to convince you it's your duty. 
* Because every moral system is just some shit somebody sat down and came up with. 
* And if you buy into it when it hurts you, you're a fucking tool. 
* If you are still looking for someone to worship, you're still in beta-male suck-up mode. 
* Yes, that includes Jesus. If he loves you so much, why does he never pick up the phone and call? 
* Yes, that also includes me and other redpill dudes. We'll eat your lunch out of the fridge and steal your girl. We're just not bullshitting you, not because we love you, but because we hate bullshit. 

You belong to you. You exist for you. 

Never let anyone subvert your primary directive with bullshit.",2018-02-04 11:20:04
10,Guys in High School: Here's the straight dope. Whether you want to hear it or not.,3,0,3,33j661,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/33j661/guys_in_high_school_heres_the_straight_dope/,95,1429772753.0,"**EDIT: WOW you guys are really hostile toward this post. I am seen as some sort of ""enemy"" for telling kids - KIDS - to hit the books and not put so much emphasis on getting pussy. These are not men in their 20's and 30's - these are socially awkward younger guys in high school or younger that find their way in here looking for advice. Call me a fucking loser, but that advice isn't the same as advice I'd give a legally responsible adult - but I'm an asshole for it. Well, so be it. I stand by my advice and you guys can suck a dick, because If you had sons, I'd HOPE your advice to them when they're in school isn't ""Screw your education! Get as much pussy as possible!"".** /end rant.

I've been seeing a lot of posts here from younger guys asking how to ""get the girl"" or ""be more alpha"", because they don't have success with girls, and see other ""more successful"" guys getting steady GFs or having sex at parties. 

In order to help you, you need to understand some things, so I'm going to lay them out for you. 

 * You're a teenager. Your body is flooded with hormones. You get uncomfortable random boners. You can't study because the girl next to you has her thong riding up on her hip. You feel forever alone and you know that having a girlfriend (or even just getting laid) will make your life 100% better. Why? Because your biology is overriding your brain and putting pussy on the pedestal for you. Being a man means reigning in those urges and taking control of your feelings and not becoming a slave to them. All men go through being sex-craving teenagers - it's a normal state of growth, but don't let it define you or set your priorities.

 * Girls are NOT a big mystery. They have even **more** insecurities than you do. They bleed out their vaginas for up to a week per month. They get shit for being too fat, not following the herd and they have low self-esteem and body issues. However bad you think **your** situation is, be lucky you're a guy. Girls your age are fickle, bitchy, shallow and superficial. Unless you're one of those guys who already gets female attention, don't waste your time chasing them - girls your age are a bad / risky investment. Instead, focus that energy on your studies. Women will always be there - what's the rush? The last thing you want is some chick's drama twisting you up or becoming a babydaddy at your age. 


 * You live in an artificial bubble. Your life **now** is not representative of what life is like after school - not even close - it's like life with training wheels on. Right now you if you fail a class people will offer you guidance, assistance and resources that you can use to dig yourself out of a hole. You're protected. Out in the world, you're thrown to the wolves and have to get by on your own wits and merits - nobody cares if you succeed or fail. The things you **think** are important now (going to prom, getting invited to parties, making out with chicks) are going to be trivial and in a few years you're going to look back and laugh on the huge importance you placed on those things. Your situation is temporary. You will change. Life will change you. 

 * You feel powerless because you are subjected to the rules others impose on you (parents, teachers etc.). This doesn't change much when you're an adult. You're still subject to the law and your boss. You will still need to follow some rules. But you will also be able to make some rules for yourself, and you can start now. You might be a fat kid who isn't in control of your family's diet, but you can control how much you eat and you can ask for a weight set or lift weights at school or join a sport. You might be a shy kid with no friends, but you can join a speech or debate club and hone those skills. You might be awkward around girls, but you can join the drama club, where you get to interact with them directly. There are things you can do to improve yourself right now - take advantage of the resources available to you. Playing video games for five hours a night will do absolutely nothing for your future. 

 * Things will get better. Girls start at the top of the hill and coast down until they run out of steam. Men stand at the bottom of the mountain and see how far they can climb. Your value will appreciate as you gain wealth, status and self-improve. Your appearance will change. Your acne will go away. A woman's prime attractiveness is her looks, her youth and her fertility. Your prime attractiveness are your looks, resources and status, and if you lack in one you can still have success if you excel in the others. This is why you need to study your ass off, get good grades and invest in your future - because in fifteen years the good looking jock who peaked in high school will be stuck selling used cars while the bookworm who had career goals is pulling six figures. Women are a by-product of success - if you're successful **they** will be drawn to **you**, and you haven't even come **CLOSE** to hitting your prime. Work on securing your financial future. Do that by hitting the books and making good grades. 

Re-prioritize your shit - try not to think with your dick. Girls your age are attracted to hotter, older guys or guys who other girls think are hawt (herd mentality). High school is nothing like real life, so what happens to you now socially is inconsequential. You have a lot of control over how you end up, and forming good habits now will help you tremendously later. You are so far from being at peak value, both time-wise and who you are as a person, that it's not even worth worrying about. Work on your grades and set your goals now. Your journey hasn't even started yet - this is just the warm-up. ",2015-04-23 07:05:53
11,Women want to be raped by a high value man,86,0,86,2bowat,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2bowat/women_want_to_be_raped_by_a_high_value_man/,274,1406325059.0,"Not pussyfooting around this one.  Title is literal. 

If anything could ever be classified as a Feminist's Nightmare, it's the irreconcilable notion that women are extremely aroused at the thought of being able to make a high value man so lustful that he loses control and has to have her.  Many women have struggled with this concept.  Some have cleverly come up with positive terminology to deflect from the dissonance; they'll use terms like ""ravishment"" to doll it up, as if simply assigning a new word takes away from the reality of what's going on.

Here in TRP we do not shy from these realities.  What goes through a woman's head when she contemplates being ravished is that she is of such high SMV that men lose their control just to have her.  This is a level of validation few women get to truly experience.  The male equivalent would be a pair of beautiful women demanding that you have a threesome with them.  

I've no doubt this type of post causes SJW's to froth at the mouth, but their impotent rage doesn't invalidate reality.  Consider the success of 50 Shades of Grey.  The basic synopsis is that a powerful, rich, alpha man completely lusts and forcefully dominates a perfectly boring average woman.  You'd think this banal concept would only sell to a fringe that gets off on this kink, but the book sold **70 million copies** in 8 months.  That's more than any Harry Potter novel.  And now that the movie is out I guarantee it will be a box-office hit.  Let women scream and ""Wow, just wow"" at you all they want -- their words mean nothing in relation to their actions.  Women want to be taken by force by a high value man.

So when is it rape instead of ravishment?  Aside from obvious cases of drugging someone or having sex with the unconscious (for the feminazi retards: **No one here condones these instances of legitimate rape**)  the difference is strictly in the disparity of your SMV's.  The stranger-in-the-bush is often characterized as some seedy low-life thug.  This evokes intense fear.  Being forcefully held down in bed by the muscular CEO of a Fortune 500 company does not evoke this fear.  No woman alive is comfortable by the idea that she enjoys rape, so she needs to reframe it.  Be aware of that.

So how does the average TRP'er benefit from this?  If you're already sexually active with a woman, discuss the concept of a safeword.  Even though women love the idea of being taken, there's always the chance that she may be in one of those emotional frames where she genuinely isn't up for sex, this is a failsafe.  Once you've established that, next time you're looking to sexually escalate simply ignore her token attempts to refuse.  She turns her lips away from a kiss, you force her against a wall and take it.  She tries to push you off, you squeeze her.  You grab her and throw her onto the bed, then lay into her with your weight so she can't get away.  And so on.

Paradoxically this creates intense arousal and pair-bonding in women.  I encourage you to try this.  Of all the women I've had sex with only ~5% genuinely hated rough, aggressive sex.  The other 95% beg for more afterwards.  Surprising how many victims offer to make food and drink after their ""trauma"".",2014-07-25 21:50:59
12,[FR] How I Accidentally Cucked My Best Friend,25,0,25,72iq6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/72iq6i/fr_how_i_accidentally_cucked_my_best_friend/,103,1506438591.0,"**TL;DR**: Best friend invites a girl he was setup with to a festival this weekend with an extra ticket. I get salty because he was supposed to invite our bro instead. Karma gets him back and I end up sleeping with her instead despite having no intention of doing so.

## Story

A large festival just finished this weekend in my city and I had a great time. Cool music, incredible art, and good vibes all around. Sorry for the length but I'm cross-posting this to a FB group so I wanna make sure those guys get the full story haha.

### Saturday

Saturday night I went with my best friend and one of his plates. He wanted to see some bands I didn't care about so I spent that whole night solo.

Wasn't trying to hook up with anyone, just wanted to enjoy the music and take in the atmosphere. Still, some girls were really digging my trippy glasses and I realized they'd be a great way to open girls and dance with them.

I ended up dancing with two smokeshows that night but couldn't make out with either of them. First one was really touchy so I thought she was into me but she wasn't feeling anything but dancing. Her friend was a lot more receptive but I missed my chance to try with her before they left. The other one just took my glasses and started dancing with me but she was also not into making out.

I can't really pinpoint where I fucked up but I didn't end up with anyone that night. It could've been that both girls had friends with them so maybe they didn't wanna leave their friends hanging or something. I even did the ""do you mind if I dance with your friend?"" line to involve the friends but I guess it didn't help.

Don't really care, still had a fun night regardless.

### Sunday

Sunday afternoon my best friend has an extra ticket since his plate couldn't go, so I tell him to invite one of our bros. I call our bro up and say we got tickets for him and he's super stoked to come with. Not even a minute after hanging up, my best friend says one of his buddies set him up with a girl, talking him up and everything, and to definitely invite her out with the extra ticket.

He calls our bro to give him the bad news and I get salty since now I look bad for calling him up just to cancel 2 minutes later. Still, I'm not gonna stay butt hurt about it so I just roll with it.

He leaves to pick up this girl and comes back a bit later. They both drop acid before we head out to grab some food at a local spot and here's where I start fucking up as a wingman. I'm in a no-fucks-given mood so I'm teasing the hell out of this girl, treating her like a child because she says a lot of stupid shit, but I'm also talking up my best friend and referencing some of the cool art stuff he does.

I'm a master of bullshitting and talking about literally anything so I start talking about ghosts with this girl and my bro and she's indulging me in my bullshit. Unfortunately I end up vibing more with the girl than my bro was so I pull my banter back a bit and let my bro kino to build rapport with her.

When we show up at the festival we go to the bathrooms and my friend goes ""I think you had that girl at the ghosts shit. Wouldn't be surprised if she ends up with you instead tonight."" I tell him I'm literally not even trying to do anything, I'm just being me and not paying any attention to her at all ... And then he says this girl apparently loves being treated like that. Oops.

I don't wanna cockblock my bro so I keep my distance and dance by myself for like an hour while I'm assuming he's trying to kino with her. After the artist's set, we walk to another stage and he says she's on her phone and not reciprocating to his kino at all.

To top it off ... This girl then says she wants to meet up with her _guy friend she met at another festival_ and tells us to come with her. My buddy was not having any of this so he keeps his frame and says ""no, we're gonna go watch [artist], you can come with us or go find your friend by yourself."" She didn't follow so my buddy says fuck it, we're still gonna have a great night.

We meet up with some of my fraternity brothers and have some fun dancing to some bangers. After an hour this girl texts my buddy asking where we are and where to meet her. At this point I'm sure they're both tripping hard on the acid so he goes to look for her to make sure she's okay. He doesn't find her so she texts me to come get her but I tell her I'm enjoying the set and she'll have to wait until it's done.

After the set she didn't text back when I asked where she was so I find my bro instead. We wanna find this girl since he feels responsible for her but she's not picking up or answering texts. I'm completely sober by this point but we find a friend who has Molly, so I say fuck it and take some.

We go to this LED blanket thing and the Molly hits me hard laying on the ground looking up at this thing. We see a group of hotties that are also tripping so we lay with them and let them try out the trippy glasses. I kiss one of the girls before they leave but now I wanna go see one of my favorite artists while I'm rolling that hard.

My bro didn't wanna go so I decided to go by myself to see the set. It was a great fucking experience while on Molly. Midway through the set I get a text from the girl saying to meet up at a landmark when the set is done. I tell her alright and continue having fun.

After the set I go find her and I have the sternest look on my face. She's happy I found her but I'm having none of that and go straight patriarch on her. I grab her face with my hands and scold her for running off on her own, straight up treating her like a child and saying she's gonna get punished for misbehaving. I see she's actually digging the scolding and grabs my face as well while smiling.

At this point I'm salty but I also feel great thanks to the Molly so I just start making out with her, periodically slapping her face saying I can't believe what a dumb bitch she is and telling her to tell me she's a dumb bitch. She eats it up.

I tell her we gotta find my buddy so we go walk to find him and she's all over me. We show up and she's holding my hand and my best friend has the most ""you gotta be shitting me"" look on his face hahahahaha. I tell him I'm sorry but the girl wasn't feeling him so I just stepped in. We end up walking to an after party where I kino this girl even more until we leave at 5am. We end up back at my buddy's but we're all still high so we watch a movie while we wait to come down.

I go use the bathroom real quick and come back to see my bro next to this girl hella cockblocking me (you fucker). I'm just thinking ""this motherfucker still hasn't given up!"" but I can tell she's not digging it and by this point I just wanna hate fuck this girl for what she pulled.

I say I'm gonna go home and sleep in my comfy bed and ask this girl to come with. She says yes and the rest is history.

## Final Thoughts

Suggestion to my bro since I know you're gonna read this: apparently you were too touchy with her when you met her and that kinda put her off a bit. I also noticed you came off with some scarcity body language since you didn't get to bang your plate the night before and you were really trying to get laid. Don't know if it was the acid but that's not usually how you are, was a little surprised by your actions and behaviors in some cases.

In any case, I didn't really do anything special here. I was just being myself, but this is now my default persona after 4 years of being exposed to TRP. I gave this girl no validation, treated her like a child, and she bent to my frame. Unlike my friend I also experienced no shit tests and no LMR whatsoever. I can tell she's a massive sloot ... But she does have hot friends so I might plate her to get access to her friends. We'll see what the future holds.",2017-09-26 15:09:51

IamGale here, the psych and marketing guy, and surprisingly I’m not talking to you about psych or marketing...
Today we’re talking about money, specifically how you can become a millionaire. No inner game fluff talk. This post gives you all specific industries and tactics where millionaires are created. If you're in your 20s you'll find this very interesting. Imagine if you had a million dollars? Yea, we’re going there today.

*****

#Why You Should Make as Much Money As Possible

Despite all the bullshit you hear, you should do everything in your power to get as much money as possible.

If there’s one problem you want, it’s too much money. If I had to choose, I’d rather be a rich beta bux than a broke chad. Money buys options.

I hate hearing stories about how rich people are the most miserable people in the world. Are they serious? They can pay for support, when you’re broke you don’t have anything. Being rich means you have the resources to help yourself and to help the world.

**Why traditional advice sucks**

You know what happens if you Google, “How to become a millionaire”?

You get bullshit results about the 7 habits of millionaires and how you should be reading and waking up at 5am...

But none of that advice is actually helpful in making you a millionaire. And I swear to God, I’ll kill you if you post in the comment that we should do surveys to make money...

We're talking about real money: Fuck You Money.

I’m talking about **building millionaire dollar assets** that you can sell one day. Millionaire fastlane style money.

This is the end goal:

You should have enough money to say whatever you want, do whatever you want, all with utter confidence because you know you can financially support yourself through anything.

There are so many benefits to having money. With money you can make other people happy. You can live anywhere you want. You get almost an unlimited number options available to you.

**But how do you make Fuck You Money?**

Yes, the concept is simple, add value. But it begs the question, what kind of value?

This post is going to be about the biggest opportunities out there for young men to make serious money. Please add your suggestions as well to the comments below for potential careers.

Before we start I want to give you real statistics on millionaires. Yes, it's very possible for you to become a millionaire if you work. In fact, most millionaires are first generation. Check out these statistics.

**Millionaire Statistics:**

* According to the book The Millionaire Next Door, only 20% of millionaires inherited their wealth. The other 80% earned their cash on their own. ^1
* Most modern American millionaires today (about 80%) are first-generation millionaires. ^1
* The average millionaire goes bankrupt at least 3.5 times ^1
* Only 20% of millionaires are retirees. Around 80% still go to work. ^1
* Half of all millionaires are self-employed or own a business. ^2


**Breakdown of Millionaires**

In the USA, according to highly successful entrepreneur & best-selling author Brian Tracy, here’s the breakdown of those who earn $1m annually:

* 74% – Entrepreneurs
* 10% – Highly Skilled Professional
* 10% – Corporate Executives
* 5% – Sales Professionals
* 1% – Rock Stars, Athletes, Lottery Winners, etc.

Notice how most millionaires are regular entrepreneur. You'll see shortly that finance is one of the best and safest industries to make a fortune but most millionaires you'll see are entrepreneurs.

Now we're I can show you the really good stuff. I spent a lot of time researching and linking this for you.

Below are industries in which I’ve read or heard of industries where people are making serious income. These are industries that you want to look into. The number one rule is always to follow the money.

Don’t look at how people say they’ve become millionaires. Look at what they’ve created. Normally this would take you hours to research, but I've already compiled some the best industries and markets for you to make money below.

#How to Make Fuck You Money

**1. Selling Courses Online**

By far the most common thing I see these days. Guys like Ramit Sethi, Derek Halpern, Brian Dean, Neil Patel, Udemy profs, are killing it in this space. These guys have 7 figure businesses just on selling $2000 courses.

All making millions of dollars. And Courses have some of the best margins of all time. Crazy industry right, especially as more and more millennial lose faith in College. And as relevant courses start to be exclusively online. For instance, there’s no University for SEO. Online is your best source for good information.

Examples:

* [Ramit Sethi: Real-World Blueprint for a $5-Million Week] (http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/03/04/5-million-week/)
* [Derek Halpern: How I Built A 7 Figure Business - Social Triggers](http://socialtriggers.com/exclusive/audience/)
* [Neil Patel: How I Built a 7 Figure SEO Agency](https://www.quicksprout.com/2013/01/10/how-i-built-a-seo-agency-to-7-figures-a-year/)
* [Udemy: Alun Hill](https://www.udemy.com/user/alunhill/) has a dozen udemy courses bringing him tons of money
* [Udemy: Rob Percival](https://www.udemy.com/user/robpercival/) hosts the best-selling programming courses
* [Nat Eliason: Making 53K from programming for marketers](http://www.nateliason.com/life-after-sumome/)

I believe selling courses online is one of the best-emerging markets out there for those who have something valuable to teach. There are several benefits to courses. You can charge very high price tags like Ramit Sethi ($2000+) and you can keep the same course running for years. So you create a recurring revenue. What the pros do is 4 times a year they open their courses to the public. So they create massive revenues for themselves. Even the pros on Udemy have a constant stream of revenue coming as new students sign up. Udemy takes around 50%, but you’re still making a lot of money.

**2. Affiliate Marketing**

Affiliate marketing is mostly about your traffic-generation skills. That's what you have to master as an affiliate. Once you do, you can drive traffic to high paying affiliate programs of your choice.

Here are some great examples:

* [Pat Flynn Income Report with 150k a month from affiliate marketing](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/my-january-2016-monthly-income-report/)
* [Matthew WoodWard Income Report with 12K per month from affiliate marketing](http://www.matthewwoodward.co.uk/income-report/monthly-income-growth-traffic-report-february-2016/)
* [EoFire Making 36K per month from affiliate marketing](http://www.eofire.com/income30/)
* [List of top earning blogs](http://onlineincometeacher.com/money/top-earning-blogs/)
* [Nichesiteazon making 3k/month](http://www.nichesiteazon.com/may-2015-income-report/)

Note: I’m having trouble finding public examples, but I know from first-hand experience that there a lot of SEO experts out there making 6 figure incomes from affiliate marketing in the health and gambling experience. It’s all about driving traffic to highly profitable niches like insurance, etc.

**3.Selling a Product to a Loyal Customer Base**

People either have great products or if they’re popular bloggers they leverage their fanbase and sell them stuff. Most famous bloggers are able to cash in on their fanbase with a product.

Examples:

* [Chris from Good Looking Loser on making 3 million in sales from his e-commerce business.](http://www.gll-getalife.com/get-paid/20-things-ive-learned-from-making-over-3-million-in-e-commerce-sales) If he sold that company he’d easily be a millionaire.
* [Victor Pride Making 10k/month 2013](https://boldanddetermined.com/how-i-make-10k-per-month-online/) that was 3 years ago, I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s making 5x that now.
* [Eofire making 500k from their freedom journal](http://www.eofire.com/income30/)

Most bloggers will sell information products, they’re high margin and don’t require updates like software. The biggest challenge is building a loyal audience and getting good traffic from Google.

**4. Sales for products of $5K to $500K value**

Selling medical equipment, industrial farming equipment, manufacturing equipment. Anything with a big price tag means you can get a big commission. Sales Salaries can be vary high and if you save well you can become a millionaire.

* [Medical Equipment Sales, Average salary is 153K in 2015 survey](https://www.medreps.com/medical-sales-careers/medical-equipment-sales-salary-report/)

Selling yachts and other expensive luxury/equipment items will net you great cash. I’d love if someone could post specific industries that are great for sales. Selling Solar Panels is also a great market to get into.

**5. Programming (Python, Swift, Javascript a good programmer is always in demand)**

Most programmers per se aren’t millionaires, but a lot of them who’ve created SAAS companies have become so. You also get an amazing salary if you work for a big tech company.

* [Working at Google in programming will net you anywhere from 100-160k per year](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Salary/Google-San-Francisco-Salaries-EI_IE9079.0,6_IL.7,20_IM759.htm)

**6.Finance (banking, Hedge Funds)**

This is the BIGGEST source of Millionaires according to [Wealth Insights] (http://www.lifehack.org/articles/money/the-top-industries-2014-that-created-millionaires.html). If you want to make do Finance. Despite the long hours, it’s your best bet.

* [Seniors make 200k-3M](http://www.careers-in-finance.com/ibsal.htm)

If you make it to a senior position as an investment banker you’ll be set for life. Out of all the options in this thread, this is where the most millionaires have been made in History.

**7. Virtual Reality Development**

VR is an emerging market. It’s a risk to jump in, but you might just make your millions here. For example, Palmer Lucky is worth 700M and he’s only 23… Obviously, it’s high risk, but if you’re into tech this might be the place for you to focus on.

* [Palmer Lucky’s Net Worth of 700M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Luckey)

I’m sure we’ll see more millionaires come from this market in the next couple years.

**8. E-commerce (Selling on Amazon or your own product on Shopify)**

There are tons of high earners from Amazon and selling products. When you get the #1 ranking spot on Amazon, as long you get 500+ reviews you can do really well.

* [Theamazingseller making 12k profit per month](http://theamazingseller.com/tas-042-income-report-april-2015-32559-06-amazon-fba-sales/)
* [Stephen Somers selling on Ebay and Amazon making 7 figure in revenue](https://mixergy.com/interviews/stephen-somers-turned-selling-stuff-amazon-art-form/)

**9. Real Estate**

Real estate has always been a place where people have made their fortune. Obviously, everyone thinks of Donald Trump, who’s now a billionaire from his real estate entrepreneurship. There’s also a lot of other brokers out there that are doing great:

* [Donald Trump with a net worth of 4-10 Billion](http://forbes.com/profile/donald-trump/)
* [Frederik Edlund, New York’s #1 Realtor worth 30M](http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/business-executives/fredrik-eklund-net-worth/)
* [Robert Ringer was making 1M/year through real estate, he outlines it in his amazing book](http://www.amazon.com/Winning-Through-Intimidation-Robert-Ringer/dp/0449207862)

**10. Flipping Land**

I’ve read that buying vacant land, splitting it and selling it a decent way to make money. There’s a good Reddit post on it [here](http://archive.is/O0EVz).

* [Check out this book for more information](http://www.amazon.com/The-Land-Flipper-Turning-Dollars-ebook/dp/B01CEZLS04)

Not sure if there have been millionaires, but I’ve read that it’s pretty good money. This part needs more information, though.

**11. SAAS Businesses**

Create a software as a service for a specific industry. Basically, most big tech companies are SAAS. Think of PayPal, Facebook, Twitter, Kickstarter, all the unicorns all started software businesses. But I want to focus on niche software, like lead pages, mail chimp, etc. There are also a ton of niche software that you don’t know about that make a lot of revenue.

* [Brightedge making 50M revenue](https://mixergy.com/interviews/jim-yu-brightedge/)

* [Hollis Carter selling software to school making $2M in revenue](https://mixergy.com/interviews/hollis-carter-velocity-interview/)

* [Marketo earning 210M/year](http://investors.marketo.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=954126)

So many millionaires have been made me in this sector. That’s why everyone always tells you to learn to program.

**12.Manufacturing**

I have a family member who became a millionaire in manufacturing. It’s niche but he started his own window frame manufacturing company. Had really great timing in the economy and now he’s one major window frame suppliers in North America. However, I think most manufacturing these days comes from China so I’d be weary of this industry.

* [Aakash Chemicals and Dye-Stuffs earning 40M in sales per year](http://eventualmillionaire.com/millionaire-story-aakash-shah/)


**13. Garbage and trash recycling.**

I can think of Brian Scudamore of  1-800 got junk. It’s a boring but necessary industry that no one wants to do. That’s usually a good sign. He’s worth 150M.

* [Brian Scudamore's 150M story](https://mixergy.com/interviews/brian-scudamore-1800gotjunk-interview/)

**14. Fashion**

Extremely difficult, but many founders of Zara and H&M have all become billionaires. Clothing is pretty high margin. However, a lot of entrepreneurs have tapped in niches to make really great revenues.

* [Nasty Gal Vintage Clothing earning 100M+](https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/nasty-gal-kills-it-ecommerce-how-they-did-it)
* [Mod Cloth Plus Size Clothing earning 150M+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModCloth)

**15. Mining and oil**

Start a fracking company. Sell it. Make Millions. In 2010, the fracking industry generated $76 billion in revenues for the USA.

* [Go Frac earning ~65M per month](http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-oil-slowdown-idUSL1N0Z11CM20150618)

Energy is a very lucrative but risky business. Oil prices are doing awful right now, so it's not the best time to start your fracking company. 

EDIT: As everyone is mentioning in the comments, starting a fracking company is shitty way to make money right now...  

***

**Conclusion:**

Go out and enter an industry where Millionaires are actually made! It comes down to building million dollar assets that you can sell. For those interested in hearing more business case studies a great podcast to listen to is Mixergy. Andrew Warner often interviews very high earners and talks specifically about business, revenue, strategy. A lot of the examples from here are from Mixergy interviews.

#I want to hear from you! What industries do you think are the most lucrative for young guys? Can you add an example?

14,Its impossible to stay BP if you saw what I saw,11,0,11,51eeme,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/51eeme/its_impossible_to_stay_bp_if_you_saw_what_i_saw/,65,1473183170.0,"Tl;dr: Female hypergamy is very, very real gents.

Some info before I start:

I recently joined the pus.
I live on base.

I went to the gym on base earlier today and saw someone I hadn't seen in about 7 months. Suddenly I remembered something I thought was worth sharing:

7 months ago I graduated from the recruiting school and was officially a member of the military in my country (not the US if you're wondering). As part of the recruitment process we were assigned new living quarters and a new timetable, after many boring briefs, our last brief of the day was about our new PT (physical training) program.

We were sitting in a briefing cinema filled with 100 new sailors. Around 70 were men and about 30 women. Now, they all weren't HB10's, but most at least had slim, tight bodies due to the unrelenting physical training and controlled diet we had during our recruitment training, to say it plainly, they were all pretty bangable.

Suddenly I noticed the atmosphere changed in the room; people perked up and the loud chattering dulled to soft whispers, someone had walked in....

It was our physical trainer hosting the brief.

He was about 6'8"", had a chiseled jaw, golden hair and blue eyes, was jacked as fuck, golden tan, pearly whites, and had a tattoo sleeve. Now, I'm no closet homo, but I know an attractive man when I see one. This guy was pretty much a model thrown in military uniform.

Every women in the room audibly sighed. Every. Single. One.

To put it simply:

The brief was a train wreck. The poor guy just wanted to explain the timetable and be on his way, but was forced to  face a room of raised, thin-wristed hands - only leading to unrelated, and unrelenting sexual advances thinly-veiled as questions. You could have cut the sexual tension in the air with a butter knife.

I felt bad for a few of the guys in the room. During our 3 months of recruit training, some male and female members grew quite close and formed relationships. Some of those female members were already married, some to civilians some to *other military members*. 

My point being: There were few single women in that room, yet you could hear every vagina collectively gushing like it was niagra falls.

Female hypergamy is very, very real.

These women didn't care about their boyfriend's/husbands *even though some of them were in the room with them.*

They didn't care about being the pursuer, or looking like a whore, *which women usually care very much about,* because **every** other woman was practically jumping this guy's loins. 

For her, this is her chance to obtain the seed of a man in the top 1%, and every other woman in the room is fighting for it as well. Being labelled a whore is the least of her worries. 

This, gentleman, is an example of how fast things can change for you. Even if your LTR loves you more than she thought possible, all it takes is a more attractive man with better genes than you to waltz along, and given the opportunity, she will jump ship faster than you can say: ""but why?!""

This is why marriage isn't advised in this sub. Honour does not exist for women. Their biological imperative trumps all. Logic. Rules. Laws. But it is not their fault, it is just how they are. It is a hard pill to swallow, but you must understand that you cannot love and trust woman like men do in hollywood movies.

Remember: You must always be prepared for the scenario where she cheats on you with a better man. It may never happrn to you, but even if you've done everything right, things can change in an instant. It isn't anyone's fault. Hard next and move on.",2016-09-06 17:32:50
15,"Are you going to fuck your bros? If not, why is ""bro code"" suddenly the fashionable solution to dealing with the difficulties that women present? (Solutions need to actually achieve the original goal of getting laid)",4,0,4,2qi8a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2qi8a4/are_you_going_to_fuck_your_bros_if_not_why_is_bro/,93,1419683988.0,"We need some ""corrective"" discussion up in here. This shit is getting ridiculous.

In yet another post lamenting the nature of (western) women, this was the main point that was upvoted:

>focus on building real true frienships with other guys, guys that probably are gonna be there when you need them 

How is this sexual strategy again? How is this relevant to getting laid and cultivating plates?

In short, why does ""Bro Code"" have to be the fallback plan in every post where a guy is having trouble with women? Why is withdrawing from women even considered? What happened to actually *learning* how to deal with them?

Examples of actual sexual strategy:

- Flakes: double and triple book my dates for redundancy. 

- Drunk girls: Don't target girls at bars who are plastered. Or, work out logistics so dates are near your place and within walking distance so you don't have to negotiate them into a cab.

- Western women: Target selection. Take control of where you live (I live in Asia (personal choice I made) that has certainly solved this problem). Or choose better what targets you talk to. Or move to a bigger city like LA or Vancouver. Or [make your frame solid that women's shit tests don't matter](https://archive.today/P3bLx).

- Lack of loyalty (cheating) in women vs men: This is the nature of women and can be understood and exploited. Women are not men and loyalty to *one* man has never benefited them. What they *are* 100% loyal to is high SMV (could be one man or many). Once you understand that, you can achieve high SMV so you don't have to deal with this.

Not sexual strategy:

- ""Ugh I got burned by a bitch again. So fucking done. Going into monk mode, fellas!""

- ""Always value your bros because they won't betray you!""

So...are you going to turn gay? Are you going to fuck your guy friends when you're horny? 

Yeah I didn't think so...so, why is that even offered as a solution? What happened to solutions that actually accomplish the original goal? (aka effective ways of getting laid and dealing with the *true* nature of women, the understanding of which has been largely lost in today's generation of men).

Again, this sub is about **Sexual Strategy**, which requires you are actually in the game. 

It's NOT a male support group where we recover from the big, bad, meanie women and act all horrified how they don't share male views of sex/relationships/commitment/honesty and the favorite ""bro code"" word of the day: Honor.

Newsflash: If you are dumb enough to put trust into a woman and then get surprised/butthurt when she doesn't reciprocate, then you don't know women. If put in 10/10 effort and are entitled enough to think women should/will put in 10/10 effort back, you don't know women.

Women respond according to what will garner them the man with highest resources, and the ""morality"" of that response is irrelevant. Women will rationalize/justify/hamster their behavior after the fact; In her mind, cheating on you or dumping your ass for a buffer guy was 100% justified and not wrong. Complain about it all you want, but she made the right choice FOR HER, for her survival, for her instincts. 

---

On the other hand, if you actually GET sex regularly, you will understand that lumps/drunk girls/random flakes/etc go with the territory. Yet, these difficulties now precipitate ""monk mode with my bros"" instead of actually solving the issue.

Seriously, you know how many drunk girls have thrown up in my bathroom/kitchen? How many times a girl has ghosted on me? How many times I've fucked a girl I thought was totally into only me and then her phone rings while she's sleeping and it shows up as ""❤❤❤ My Bobby ❤❤❤""? 

These ""speed bumps"" shouldn't be surprises, nor should they justify opting out of the game. It will not solve your issue.

Further, the implication that monk moders have a monopoly on male friendship, working out, or saving money is ridiculous. There is no connection. Getting laid gets me lots of male friends who give me props and want to party with me; it gives me the motivation to work out harder; it saves me $ because I spin plates who come directly to my home instead of buying them dinner/drinks.

TLDR: Get better at getting laid; Don't give up on it altogether. If the goal is to get laid and you fail at that, suddenly redefining the goal as not getting laid anymore is a total cop-out.",2014-12-27 12:39:48

I thought it was satire at first, but clearly serious. A subreddit devoted to exposing women for getting away with things simply for having a vagina is so eager to upvote that shit to the top.

Bonus points for dropping her twitter, pulling the cancer sympathy card, and then claiming she's not looking for attention because:

Translation:  ""No, I'm not looking for attention, which you would have known if you had given me more attention!""

17,I destroyed my Ex social circle with her own hypergamy,0,0,0,4lkyha,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4lkyha/i_destroyed_my_ex_social_circle_with_her_own/,39,1464566557.0,"tl:dr
Old plate / girlfriend wants to meet up, we meet and in the end is going nuclear on her own social circle.

Body

It has been a while since I swallowed the pill. My then girlsfriend let's call her S for this story endured the blast of my anger phase - while still in the honeymoon phase. This is ironic because S became a sexual freak during. I stopped her advances because I saw what she was doing. Bribing me with sex to gain my affection and it was disgusting. 

After I passed every shit test possible through my anger ""yea when you leave take out the garbage""; ""I have no interest in your family before I know you so I won't baby sit your teenage sister"" etc. I failed every comfort test: ""Hell, I never get married honey"" ""We go ice-skating when we have children because hell will be frozen over"" she broke up with me; how surprising.

This was saddening for me because she had a warm nature and stayed with her personal king of the betas for over 3 years together before we met and she branch swinged. While she was 19, 3 years with a full blown beta is remarkable. She is an HB7 for that matter. She went back to her former-former ex-boyfriend a fat dude who banged her well and so the radio silence started.

Fast forward 6 month

So her we go: she sent me a text asking for some legal aid. Knowing the RP, I immediatly figured she and fatty-fatso broke up; and a meaty lawyer-steak á la providér seasoned with abs smells so good.

We meet and I still have some anger in me. Not anger against women but anger against her, she changed me for a fat fuck who lives in a van and now wants to change back. 

Anyway, we talk. She tells me stuff about her dad being an asshole.  I do not listen. Like it was when were doing fun stuff (I was very poor in my younger years so I enjoy amusment parks and doing spontanious things I never had the money for in my teens). 

Then S asked me whether we want to meet up again. 

To which I replied what her legal question was because I got appointments (lie). 

After some mumbling about seeing me again she tells me she thinks about 'us'. 

I look her in the eye: ""you left and fucked your ex, I am not your plan B"" shocked about this she asked how did I know after denying everything for several minutes.

And so the machiavellian H-Bomb is about to be dropped:

 ""people, especially your friends talk, and you know what, people talk in a very detailed way"".

This is all a lie - a gamble if you will; I knew from Facebook that she was seeing a fat guy who had pics of a van in the background, dumb as S is she rambled back in our LTR about how much of an idiot she were when she dated that guy and showing me pictures of him.

I left.

Three hours later: an unknown number messaged me. Telling me all the shit they told me were in confidence blah blah blah. Mind you none of her bitch friends told me anything.


Lessons learned:
Girls don't even know which secrets they share
Girls forget about everything given enough time
She is not yours, it's only your turn
Girls don't have real friends they have subjects of validation and will abandon them at will

He strolls up like, ""Sorry I think you dropped something... my jaw."" 


Whatever. Dudes will flirt. I'm standing there, lightly grilling him on his nerdy cashmere sweater, not really paying him mind. However, I notice my girl starts making heavy eye contact with him. At one point, he's holding out this peppermint candy to her, asking, ""You want it?"" My girl says: **""Feed it to me.""** While looking him dead in the eyes. There was no mistake: it was seductive af. I also noticed she was lightly running her fingertips up his stomach/torso. 

At this point, I grab her HARD by the forearm, yank her over to the side, and say, **""Do NOT fucking disrespect me like that. Ever.""** ""Do you want me to walk on you?"" etc. Suddenly, flirty-boy's posse  steps up and they're like, ""Don't touch her yo."" ""Why you being rough with her?"" etc. 

I tell them to mind their business and they back off. I'm fucking pissed, so, I storm off to the staircase (the balcony at this bar was upstairs). My friends are downstairs ordering drinks. 
I find them and prepare to leave as my girl's coming up behind me. I'm completely ignoring her and she's crying. We're starting to walk out and she's getting increasingly hysterical, shouting at me, saying, ""You have no idea how much I've given up for you! I cut off everyone!""

We continue walking down the street; her yelling and crying, me ignoring her, my friends awkwardly walking ahead of us. At one point I start splitting off in the other direction from her, to head to my friend's house, and she goes: ""FINE!"" 

*Not even 10 seconds later she comes running back up to me. Pleading.* **""I can't do this""** she sobs.

Eventually she gets really fucking hysterical (especially after I told her to fuck off) and at this point it's a legit *scene*. We're standing in the goddamn pouring rain and she's yelling and crying, her fucking makeup running everywhere. Repeating the same excuses over and over. She's saying sorry, and yet, also proclaiming she ""doesn't remember"" and ""doesn't know what she did."" 

Anyways. That night was the 1st time she told me she loves me. Neither of us had said it before over the 8 months we've been seeing each other (and we did have an LTR for a short period). 

Did I overreact here? From my retelling of the story it may sound like it, but all I did was swiftly reprimand her then ignore her. The other 80% of the time was her meltdown.

20,Women have no game at all.,2,0,2,1cr401,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1cr401/women_have_no_game_at_all/,32,1366510225.0,"The hissing of past prime women is almost deafening.

I was out at a fancy function last night, the kind where all the men wear suits and all of the women wear dresses kind of event.

At first it was a meet and greet with the fellas, but it quickly dissolves from a civilized affair into its true form: past prime women on or off the carousel, desperately looking for a man, with no game and looks fading fast. Women approaching men left and right, and doing a horrible job of it.

**First woman** - was discussing something or other with a friend and I get tapped on the shoulder (approached from behind. Bad game). I turn around. I see two young 30 something women, makeup plastered on. ""Are you Jim?"" one says. ""No... Nope, not Jim, sorry"" I say. They're looking at me still. They continue ""Oh because we thought you were Jim"". They're trying to open me, but what kind of line is that? And why are women opening? Because no men are opening them. There are better options out there. Still, I am not opposed to a little game. They ask ""how is your night going? I'm Jen"". Jen is drunk. She's hot, for an older broad. She spills her drink on me almost immediately. ""OMG I'm SO SORRY"" She starts touching my chest. I'm unamused. ""You can make it up to me with a kiss I guess"". We kiss. She says she wants to go get another drink. I'm almost in disbelief, the last thing this woman needs is another drink. Her other friend leaves, and I go with this girl to the bar. I kino along the way, get a good feel for this girls body. Its pretty tight. She tried to DHV the whole time. Brings our a business card, she's a Human Resources Director for some businesses in town. I don't care. But this is her best game. We walk towards the dance floor. A big black guy comes over and they exchange kisses and lots of kino and sly glances and whispers. They're quite obviously fucking. He leaves, she looks at me ""what??"" I say ""not much"" she's pretty into kinoing me at this point, I'm looking for another set, or my friends or something. Enter another guy,  same deal, kiss kiss sly glances real close. He comes over to shake my hand, hard eye contact and really tries crushing my hand during the handshake. He clearly doesn't want me f-closing a chick in his harem. I look at this drunk mess trying to grind me, I think about how awful it would be to knock her up and how its not really worth it to pursue any further. I tell her to enjoy dancing but I'm gonna jet. I leave.

**Second group of women** - The night is advances and a bro and I are chatting. The night is coming closer to an end and we're discussing our sets that evening. I see a group of women scheming in my peripheral vision. They come over and open us. More girls opening, and not very well. They say hi and then stop. I'm sorta waiting for them to say something, but of course they have nothing. No game. Thats my job as a man. I'm a little bored at this point, but whatever, I'll entertain. I touch the hottest girl's elbow and lean in 'so how's your night going'. She starts playing with her hair and rattling on about her night. She's late 20's with a literature degree and is working an unpaid internship. She starts talking about inequality in society. Oh god. Her less attractive (read: not attractive) friend jumps in at a moment of silence and asks me if I wanna come to a big party. I say ""yeah I love big parties"" she goes ""Its not really big, just me and my cousin.. There will be like 4 people there. So how should we do this? Wanna arranage it through facebook or something?"". This girl is clearly wanting the D. So is the other one. They're independant-educated-women.jpg (read: past prime, poor, and fading looks). I don't want any of these women to know my full name or have access to my facebook so I do my traditional number close. ""Why don't you just put your number in my phone and I'll call you sometime..."" She's extatic, first girl who was actually kind of beautiful is sad that her friend got the number. She puts her number in my phone, I say thanks, I gotta go now though, find my friends and stuff. Bye!"" I leave.

I go to my bros. Tell them I'm leaving. I walk out, throw the business card in the trash and delete the number from my phone. An SUV is at a stop light by the crosswalk. The man in the passenger seat says ""Hey, the driver here thinks you're sexually attractive!"" - I'm not surprised by this, I deadlift pretty frequently and know how to dress myself. Its a woman. A woman driving some beta around. WTF.jpg.

So yeah, I go home and since I didn't find anything spectacular at the function, I go home and bang my young 22 year old woman. She's pretty hot and feminine. Good enough.

Women who have to open men are fishing from a small pond. They aren't youthful and attractive enough to have men falling all over eachother for them anymore but they still want as much male attention as they can get. They are failures as women. They will have to settle for some super beta, because seriously, they *are* competing with young women who are willing to trade some of their best years for that provision that all women naturally seek.

If you could only see the looks on these women's faces. It was that desperate ""I want you I want your attention I want to seduce you but I don't know how its never been this hard before"" kind of look. That look that men have before they learn that they need game to win in today's sexual market place.

These older women are absolutely pathetic.

""But zionController, women don't hit their sexual peak until they're 35!!""  Laugh my fucking ass off they do.

Sure, netscape already existed, but it wasn't something everyone was really paying much attention towards.


*Let's get back on track.*


This video series was about *18 year old girls on college breaks* that take the undergraduate educational experience as a birthright. The saddest reality is when you keep a keen eye on their intelligence, and they don't even remember the shit they learned last year. Most, if not all, their minds **rely** on fulfilling a *criteria* for a very **simplistic and short-term cognitive performance examination**, (which includes using a #2 pencil to precisely mark in a very specific section of a paper representation of runic intelligence) the ability to compose words on a keyboard with their fingers that her dad taught her to print, and reading off powerpoint slides that were invented by much better men than me. *Moving on.*


The point of this matter is that girls understand that their youth is the **most critical period** of their entire lifetime. And so capturing it on something as eternal as media is an inherent benefit *while their lives continue down a spiral of self-destructive critical thinking; denying all personal responsibility for their behaviors due to simplistic and short-sighted cognitive performance evaluations, followed by inappropriate recourse.* I am at an ivy league school and **I fucking hate it** when my fellow classmates are to be representatives of the future, and yet there are individuals who don't even pay attention to class by **sleeping or shopping for boots** on their laptops. A very good friend of mine, whom I initially pegged for very intelligent and able to speak two languages, admitted to me that her language abilities are only limited to **CONVERSATIONAL** matters. She can sing really well, though. But all she's good for to me is her vagina, and that's okay. She just isn't that special to want to have more, and in truth, most of these hot girls aren't. *Moving on.*


The result of this matter puts a spotlight on the certain category of females that us men choose to pay attention towards: The Sexually Attractive Female. And then it becomes like C++ and you have to define further classes of sexually attractive females and delete pointers (nexting), but I digress.


**Girls Gone Wild** exposed the very kind of sex appealing females we see at bars, clubs, and discos today (I haven't been to a disco, but I'm sure there are still cool people that did, and really know how to have a fucking great time). Majority of females see the appeal in having a *time-locked digitized representations of their physical beauty* as it **decays**. These are females who are....................

*40 years old in our world*

 (Yes, it really has been that long). 


But their short-sighted cognitive performance fails them with improper recourse and dysfunctional behavior. August Ames killed herself because she knew her sexuality was worth more than her very soul in this world after committing to virtual prostitution. That her mortal coil is but a shell for the electrolytic activity that is responsible for her physical manifestation in this reality. And she sees the happiness that many share instead of her. She sees the difference in how they look, and how she, herself looks, because us men notice this, and choose to share our resources to a variable degree because of sexual activity that only males and females can intimately share & abuse (properly or improperly). *In other words, ugly girls don't get to choose who we think is ugly or not, and they have no choice but to feel left out of their own sexual desires. So the many who are left out (usually gluttonous with sugar too), band together, and form soulful relationships because they don't choose to participate in a physical beauty contest they believed to have lost from the start. This happens while the pretty girl gets to ride in our cars and suck our cocks because she did win the contest, but then later feels as if it wasn't worth winning in the first place.*


So there you have it, a really long post that talked about many things, and yet somehow ties it to a historical relic from the spicy paid television series that was operated by Americans **AND** distributed nation-wide, in every home that owned a VHS player. With this evidence, we can see why society places such huge value in those bathroom mirror pictures that every pretty girl can take. Just always remember. *There. Are. A. Lot. Of. Pretty. Girls.* There will always be a lot. **Isn't that wonderful guys?** Isn't that just amazing? There are more than enough for each of us, and we can even share if everyone involved is okay with that. But right now I'm busy doing things where you all know me as that one dude who did that one thing really well one time, even though he was pretty terrible at it from the start. I wish fat girls would just get on board with this mentality so that there could be less of them for us to look at, but the ones I know and confront seem to respond with an ""idk"" response, followed by recollection of the personally devastating external events that led to a lot of ice cream and soda consumption. **All I see is silly compensation.** A guaranteed emotional reward with comfort in the event of unpredictable emotional discomfort, followed by a realization of a dependence towards this guaranteed emotional comfort, which concludes with self-perpetuated emotional discomfort. Sucks to silly, but it's not Ben's fault. Or Jerry's fault for that matter. No, it's the milk factories fault for cultivating and then immobilizing cows, jerking off their udders with automated systems, and then signing renewing contracts (guarantees) that are permissible in this economic real-o-sphere. This in reality governs national policy and the triple caramel chunk that exists in the frozen section of our local grocery sources. But wait...No, it's the policymaker's fault for being so stupid in the first place for allowing the fat health advisor to keep her day job so that she can keep depending on her triple caramel chunk to stop the tears. I think the feminist MO is rubbing off on me too much, so I'll stop that tangent here. 


And so on and so forth does the internal blame game continue to shift as this particular example of a simple-minded human existence continues to reward herself with self-destructive behavior, in whatever shape or form we see today. Pretty girls and ugly girls, both do it in various ways. And yet, they will always be one and the same in the end.


So do yourself a favor by realizing that most pretty girls are doomed from the start. And that you have no choice but to stop being nice to them because the world is already so cruel; nothing you do will stop it unless you want to risk **mania, psychosis, & neurosis**. If you act nice to girls that you want to fuck, then an anticipatory ROI is placed on the chessboard of your interactions, and she sees this now. This shouldn't be taken as a need to act more mean. It is just that the one who *truly appears to act completely indifferent* about the small behaviors that are intended to elicit a manipulated response is the one who wins. This has to last throughout the relationship, or she gets bored and moves on to destroy her life again by trying to be a puppet master with her short-sighted cognitive performance inherited by her ancestral manifestations that led to her own creation. **You must be the puppet master with your evolutionary advantage of detaching emotional responses with rational and reasonable thought**. Even better if she's cool with that because you have convinced her that you are the best that she will ever have in her short window for securing lifetime happiness. Failure to do so can be devastating for both of you, but unless one continues to fail, how else will he succeed? Okay enough writing, I'm going to lift now. I was really sad that I did 8 windshield wipers a week ago, and then could only do 3 on Monday. I'm such a pussy for resorting to deadlifts as an excuse for failing, but I think I can do 10 today if I don't do it at the end of my session. Cmon guys, brag about your lifting. Good for you if you actually did what you say.


**Conclusion. Preemptively approach a female with your phone's camera already set up for a video selfie. Every girl wants to demonstrate to the world about how kind and/or cool they are, which include the desire to be viewed as likable within a hidden audience that she is unaware of, nor really cares about. This creates an atmosphere of interest between the two of you because of her unknown evaluations of your desirable traits, which include social and financial capital. Ice broken, next legs open.**


TL;DR: Humans have two forms: Male & Female. Females are against time, more so than males. Pixelated mirror representations in digital space are an easy way for her to time-lock herself because she is aware of her race against time in this reality. This is so valuable to them that many are willing to make irresponsible life decisions that are not taken with serious consideration for securing long-term value. This includes your penis in her vagina.

In Julius Evolas book [""Ride the Tiger""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNthPoryBRA&list=PLrHG_aAvxl-ntYGuatlrosCwNTold7CMO) it advocates a [radical approach](https://youtu.be/jc-q6wjJz18) to degeneracy. One of them was, for the majority of people to be degenerate as possible, to push the envelope on breaking society by pushing through the few fundamental traditionalist values holding society together. That includes fucking as many **[temple prostitutes](https://aidanmaclear.wordpress.com/2018/12/19/we-are-not-rome/)** as possible, maybe making yourself a [biological weapon](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/new-california-law-reduces-penalty-knowingly-exposing-someone-hiv-n809416) and taking as many degenerates with you just like a Japanese Kamikaze pilot.

The other option was to create an atmosphere for [""Men Among the Ruins""](https://youtu.be/AvHM7H_hh80). These include places as such as this forum, the gym or any space the intent or outcome of the place is an negative outcome for an system any rational and traditional male would consider absurd. The current west is all about sacrificing and [castrating](https://twitter.com/Capt_sav_a_hoe/status/1077014207101583360) men&women, especially children to the [Moloch God](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moloch).

23,"Post red pill, is 'the game' still worth it?",3,0,3,1fnoio,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1fnoio/post_red_pill_is_the_game_still_worth_it/,98,1370390085.0,"I am a recovering blue pill addict, and am slowly coming to terms with the reality of the dynamic between the sexes. I have a lot of questions, as I'm sure most men do immediately post swallow.

The gist of swallowing the red pill to me seems largely a matter of lowering one's expectations of the benefits of a romantic or sexual relationship with a female. [Iron Rule of Tomassi #6](http://therationalmale.com/2011/12/27/women-in-love/) and [Briffault's Law](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1anu3q/briffaults_law/) come to mind as reasonably succinct quintessences of the idea.

Accepting these rules as true (and boy do they explain a lot), doesn't this vastly decrease the perceived value of *every* woman period? It feels an awful lot like I have been saving up my whole life for a race-car, only to find out that *all* cars max their speed out at 15 MPH, and are twice as expensive as I was lead to believe (shitty metaphor, but I think it makes sense).

To put it bluntly:

Given that a woman is incapable of the sort of dependable, long term love most men seem to crave, and given that this inherently increases the maintenance cost of what ends up being the female version of love (if it is transient and conditional, it needs to be maintained constantly), is it still worth it to pursue women as mates for anything remotely serious? What makes it worth it?

Also, given that consistent sexual strategies have been proven to be successful amongst many different women, isn't the actual gratification received upon success substantially diminished? Whenever I have success with a girl via game techniques, the success feels superficial and dishonest. After all, I often find myself needing to suppress actions that I genuinely want to engage in (being significantly  less romantic/mushy at times, hiding interests in socially unacceptable hobbies), and needing to engage in actions I find boring at best, and reprobate at worst (pretending to enjoy obnoxious social events and pop culture, insulting/ostracizing perfectly nice 'beta' guys to establish Alpha).

How does the cost-benefit analysis work out for you all?",2013-06-04 23:54:45

25,MGTOW are simply incels who celebrate the fact they can't get any pussy rather than feel down about it,5,0,5,73a3il,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/73a3il/mgtow_are_simply_incels_who_celebrate_the_fact/,140,1506741931.0,"I know I am going to be downvoted for this post because we have a lot of incels who celebrate the fact they don't get vagina(aka MGTOWs) around here.

But I do not know why people think MGTOW is part of TRP. It's not. I don't speak for the ECs around here but I have never seen any of them ever endorse MGTOW, but I have seen plenty of them say how retarded MGTOW is. 

Let me tell you a story. In college I played football. My sophomore year we had a shitty year by our standards. So naturally we had a bunch of guys who didn't play much or at all, jump ship and quit. After they quit when I would see them around all they talked about was how great of a decision it was to quit and how happy they were and how stupid football was. They claimed they quit because they had better things to do. They may or may not have been right but they always made sure to let everyone know how stupid football was. The next 3 seasons we had record years, finished ranked high in the polls and went to big bowl games. These guys who quit seemed to double down and shout even louder about how good of a decision it was to quit despite our success. Even though deep down you could tell they regretted it and were jealous of the success they could have been a part of had they not quit. They quit not because they wanted more free time or had better things to do, but because they didn't play and didn't want to put in the time/effort needed to put themselves in a position where they could get more playing time. It was easier for them, and looked better on them, to simply quit than put in the effort. 

That's exactly what MGTOW is. You don't want to put in the time/effort to get more sexual action, so instead you quit. It's the ""You can't fire me, I quit""! attitude of the sexual realm. MGTOW is simply your excuse, your smokescreen, your justification for not improving and doing what it takes. 

I know what you MGTOW are going to say. ""I had success, you see. But women suck! I want nothing to do with them!"". I call bullshit on you. Are you telling me if you had a stable supply of pussy and abundance when it came to sex, you'd walk away from it all and instead say fuck it? That's not how men are biologically programmed. Just admit you go MGTOW because you have no abundance, you have no game, you aren't successful sexually. It's a lot easier to walk away when you are failing rather than succeeding. That's why on my football team, when we started to get really good, no one quit anymore. Because no one wants to walk away from success. It's not how people are. 

MGTOW is the coward's way out. It reminds me when I was a pussy when I was 12 years old and went to my first junior high school dance. I was so afraid to ask a girl to dance with me I just sat out in the courtyard the whole time. I justified it by telling all my friends I was too tired from football practice earlier, when in reality I was just a pussy. It was easier for me to whip up some excuse as to why I didn't dance, rather than grow a set and do what it took to get a girl to dance with me. You think if I had danced with a dozen girls that night that I would have said fuck it and sat out in the courtyard and told all my friends I was too tired? Fuck no. Yet, that is what a lot of you MGTOW claim. ""I was so successful with women and had 25 plates and fucked 5 women a day, but fuck women, I decided to MGTOW!"" Yeah, no. 

Stop being a coward. It's really not that hard. I had a girl last night who was doing carryout at a restaurant I was picking up from. She was an HB6, nothing special but just cute/hot enough for a quick fling. She mentioned she liked my haircut. That compliment/IOI was all I needed to transition to a point where I ran game on her and 3 hours later when she got off her shift I was balls deep in her vagina in my bedroom. She was trashy and had tattoos and all other kinds of red flags that disqualified her from even plate material so I won't be seeing her again, but it's really not that hard guys. Some of you MGTOW need to realize that. You act like fucking a woman is like having to climb Mount Everest when in reality if you do things right its nothing more than walking up a staircase.

26,Some Of You Really Have It All. Wrong.,0,0,0,3uog9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3uog9c/some_of_you_really_have_it_all_wrong/,46,1448802918.0,"TLDR: Shaming others and putting women in their place is what you SHOULD be doing. 

I see a lot of criticism recently on men who put women in their place. The typical criticism is that you are wasting your time and your breath and that it is not ""alpha"" to do so. And that it is no way to get laid. Bingo, thats the problem with that mentality right there, trying to get laid...

An Alpha male doesn't really try to get laid. I know, CRAZY huh. You're reading this and going oh bullshit so not true. Well it is I know from personal experience. Let them come to you. The fact that you compromise your beliefs and ideals just to get laid is repulsive. You are not RP. There is a quote my father told me since I was very young and have never forgotten, ""All it takes for evil to prevail in this world, is for good men to do nothing.""
And those with the mentality that it is a waste of time are guilty of just that. Natural selection is not going to weed these types of women out of the pickings. There is far too much media and men to support and reinforce their behavior. And it has gotten out of control, obviously. Thats why we are discussing it on this sub today. 

Shaming a slut or whore or feminist is exactly what you should be doing, Through intelligence. Not simply returning verbal blows, but actually de-assembling her ego and persona. Women might seem stupid but they are not. What you say to them if done correctly will ring in their psyche for the rest of their life. And that is where the change begins. When a man is being a pussy and letting his GF walk all over him, if all of his friends let him know he is being this way, chances are he will change and heed their advice. Similarly if men let women know the same when they are in the wrong. If enough take this approach, then we will start to see change.

You are not ""alpha"" because you are willing to dodge one or two shit tests and fuck some girl in a bar after a few cocktails. Sorry... If that is what you base your dominance and manlyhood on you are a pussy. Plain and simple. You are a boy. A boy with no control over his sexuality that simply needs to just get it in so bad! Ohhh god I can't wait to just fuck her and then I am so ""alpha"" now and so ""dominant"" because I fucked an inebriated bar slut even though she annoys the shit out of me. And in the morning I will solidify my ""alpha dominance"" by starting to play my video games and tell her to leave! Yeah... mmk. 

Being a man is having control over your sexuality and its needs. Channeling it. Because that testosteronal sex drive is some of the best fuel you can ever use to fund your life. Following your passions, obtaining success in the field of those passions, being content, fit, healthy, and strong. Helping the sick and being a leader amongst so many losers and failures. Being kind and courteous, until trampled on. Always being ready to destroy the enemy yet never wanting to have to do so. Complete control. That is dominance. That is Alpha. Handle your shit. 

Setting aside your beliefs and ideals just to get laid, your no better than the muck slut bar flys you hit on and succumb to. Re-think your shit. Stop masturbating to images on a computer screen and jazzing into a kleenex 3 times a day since you were 13, and go make something of your life. Build some fucking character. Move out... save money while moved out... If you are living at home past the age of 20 you're a fucking child. And don't tell me you're saving money, shut the fuck up. Seriously. 


Looks like this really hit a nerve on a number of you! I am glad. TRP is full of a lot of these types of porn addicted pussified guys who will do whatever it takes to get laid haha. Love it!",2015-11-29 13:15:18
27,"Agree and amplify is dead in 2019, Ironic Acknowledgement is for Millennial Girls",53,0,53,bone1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/bone1z/agree_and_amplify_is_dead_in_2019_ironic/,107,1557891076.0,"# Intro:

Humor and cultural norms have evolved, along with shit tests themselves. While Agree and amplify has worked well in the past, it has already been replaced with Ironic Acknowledgment and it's time for you to catch up.

# What is Agree and Amplify, how did it work?

Simply put, A&A (Agree and amplify), is where you agree with someone, and amplify their argument to the point of absurdity.

Ex:

    Her: You're such a douchebag
    You: Yea, cuz you'll only find me in the pussy
    Her: Wow that's disgusting
    You: I like to hang out in the garbage afterwards 

&#x200B;

While humorous to the speaker, it only proves the listener right in 2019 Liberal Logic^(TM) and makes you seem autistic for not understanding that bloopies in 2019 are going to defeat A&A with:

# Litteral Interpretation:

A&A is dependent on the listener having a sense of humor, which fails in 2019 where everything is offensive, even sarcasm, and with remarks that are obviously humorous. A&A is defeated when your listener takes what you say at face-value, or breaks the fourth wall and acknowledges that you are trying to make a joke of the issue.

    Her: You're such a douche bag
    You: A&A
    Her: You're not funny and this isn't a joke

\*\*A&A doesn't work in the age of Liberal-Logic\*\*\*\*\*\***^(TM)** **Virtue-signaling as A&A is meant to be an Anti-Virtue Signal.** With A&A you are directly competing with liberals by saying, ""I don't care about the issue."" Where as they are directly competing with you by saying, ""You're subhuman for not caring"". Your plausible deniability is out the window along with any sort of mystery you could have had.

Here liberals are trying to squeeze you for sweet orange flavored validation juice, and you let them when you A&A. Instead give them Lime Juice with...

# Ironic Acknowledgement:

Here is some verbal Jui-Jitsu where you use your opponents momentum against them and defeat them with leverage. Key here is to ***hold*** ***Frame*** and deliver with as much sarcasm as possible. When people try to squeeze you for an answer you just give them the answer they want from a disingenuous point of view. Taking your statements at face-value is self defeating for the listener. Most people get tired right away after squeezing you and getting pure salt.

Dealing with accusations:

IA (Ironic Acknowledgment)

>Her: Are you even listening to me?  
>  
>You: Yea, *so interesting*

Vs: A&A

    Her: Are you even listening to me?
    You: Every single word

IA

>Her: I can't believe you're making a joke out of this  
>  
>You: This is so *super* *serious*

vs A&A

    Her: I can't believe you're making a joke out of this
    You: Not any more of a joke then your relationship with your dad

Her:

On the surface A&A and I&A (Ironic Acknowledgement) seem to function in similar ways, however A&A depends on your listener traveling with you as you attempt to blast their argument into outerspace. If they stay grounded you look like an idiot, or you just blow up the situation in a fashion that makes her genuinely angry vs playful angry.

&#x200B;

Dealing with Arrogance:

One of the strongest uses of IA is dealing with egotistical women in a way that deflates their ego, not justifies it like A&A. Using A&A on egotistic women simply feeds their sense of self righteousness while Ironic Acknowledgment gives them exactly what they were asking for, in a way that makes them feel stupid for asking for it.

&#x200B;

>Fatty: Don't you think i'm soooo hot?  
>  
>You: Yup, *definitely hot for sure, mhm.*

&#x200B;

>Stuck up Stacy: I'm like such a nice person, Everybody on my twitch tells me!  
>  
>You: Mhm, They're definitely watching for your *personality.*

&#x200B;

Here even if it's obvious that you're disagreeing with her, you're feeding her-own-kind-of-bullshit right back to her so she knows how full of shit she is. Even if she tries to spite you for your disingenuous actions, appearances are maintained and ultimately she has to accept her own retardation

>Her: Wow that's so mean of you  
>  
>You: Mean how?  
>  
>Her: You just called me x, y, z.  
>  
>You: Nope, I was *totally agreeing with how x, y, z you are* ***(Sarcasm is key)***

vs A&A which will remove the plausible deniability and escalate the situation (= no sex for u)

    Her: Does this dress makes me look fat
    You: Yea it's the dresses fault
    Her: You just called me fat!
    Her: Anger ensues, pussy clamps shut 

# Conclusion:

While A&A has some circumstances where it can still be applicable, Liberal virtue signaling along with the destruction of humor has left it vulnerable to Literal Interpretation - a death sentence for A&A. A&A is self defeating in the sense that it gives off the impression that you care about the shit-test, while leaving you vulnerable, and ultimately failing it (As the whole point is to demonstrate that you don't care). Irony and sarcasm maintain plausible deniability, while demonstrating to your listener that you don't give a fuck about her shit-test, and one of the quickest ways to make her pussy wet in the process.",2019-05-15 03:31:16
28,Don't Get Fucked By Black Jesus,19,0,19,8nj1ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8nj1ek/dont_get_fucked_by_black_jesus/,136,1527807230.0,"I don't know if you've heard of [Black Jesus](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0217/9998/products/black-jesus-scafa2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1492403149) or seen a Black Jesus. But for all of you who haven't: Black Jesus is normal Jew Jesus depicted as an African. Basically Blacks couldn't relate to [Jew Jesus](http://live-thedailyvoice.time.ly/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/JewishJesus.jpg) so they made themselves a Black Jesus. Makes sense I guess. Maybe us Whites should make ourselves a [White Martin Luther King](https://memeguy.com/photos/images/steve-martin-luther-king-jr-83079.png) to make him more relatable?

But here's the problem with Black Jesus. If Jesus is Black then is [Mary Black](https://naotw-pd.s3.amazonaws.com/images/ChocolateAddictjesus.jpg)? What about [the apostles](https://www.thepatriot.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/page-2-Jesus-having-the-last-supper-with-his-disciples.jpg)? Even Judas? Are all the Jews Black in Black Jesus world? How about the Romans? When do the Jews of Black Jesus world switch from being Black Jews to [normal jewy Jews](http://2xkcvt35vyxycuy7x23e0em1a5g.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ORIGINAL-CARTOON-YAIR-NETANYAHU-e1504981208160.png). I have a lot of questions about the whole arrangement, questions that have never been answered before in Black Church.

Why? Because it's impossible to ask philosophical questions when everybody be singing and dancing. Lordy Lordy! But isn't  examining the relationships of people in the Bible and learning valuable lessons the whole point of Christianity? So really the problem with the Blackification of Jesus is that it destroys the essence of Christianity just as the Caucasianification of Martin Luther King destroys the Civil Rights narrative.

Black Jesus provides a Simulacra of authentic African spirituality, while protecting Blacks from having to undergo the Real of African Spirituality: sacrificing animals, sex magic and dangerous trials. In today's busy world who has time for that? The whole endeavor is shielded from scrutiny because everyone is too busy singing and dancing.

Now Black Jesus isn't the only proverbial Black Jesus. Planet Fitness provides a fitness product without the obligation of serious physical exertion. Modern Universities provide a diploma without teaching anything of substance. American Women offer a symbolic marriage but refuse the material obligations of being a wife. No Fap allegedly helps chronic masterbators but is actually a place where masterbators masterbate about masterbation.

Black Jesus can also take the form of an individual process. It's inevitable that a [fedora gaytheist](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/616/546/ddb.png) interprets this article as an endorsement of religion. It's obviously not. But the fact that a bottom feeder prole is going to shit himself, miss the point and virtue signal for atheist points, means Black Jesus is alive and well. Perhaps someone will politically correct virtue signal [Das Rayciss](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/204/613/b74.gif). I look forward to it. Commenters proving my thesis elevates my posts into a postmodern collaborative performance.

Whenever the essential is abandoned for the symbolic that's a Black Jesus aka a Simulacrum aka a Blue Pill. This expansive  definition of the Blue Pill is difficult and unpleasant for our newcomers. That's okay. My job here is to [force difficult and unpleasant realizations onto boys who think they figured it out.](https://youtu.be/jojlVRUQoB0)

The Red Pill is more than antifeminism. The Red Pill is much bigger than that, it's a rejection of the Symbolic in favor of the Real. The Blue Pill is the inverse. Thus didling your phone in the gym instead of lifting is Blue Pill. Shooting validation texts at women instead of shooting semen is Blue Pill. SJWs are Blue Pill as their  existence in material reality is an imitation of a symbolic tumblr avatar. Likewise churning out masculinity guides while being unmasculine is Blue Pill. The most paradoxical aspect of the Red Pill is that the majority of people here never took the Red Pill and never will. They're here to act out masculinity symbolically so they don't have to live it in the Real.

As the world falls deeper and deeper into the [Postmodern Era](https://youtu.be/RJfurfb5_kw) more and more people will willfully spread their assholes for Symbolic Black Jesus. Reality is hard and pretending is easy. We’re descending into the aeon of the [eternal child. Narcissism](https://youtu.be/86OkGaKck3I), self esteem and feels are much more important than Reals.

The thing to remember is this. Sell feels. Get Realz. Give women emotion take pussy. Make your beta boss feel important take his money. The more people become children the more valuable being a rational male will be. Everyone is getting fucked in the ass by Symbolic Black Jesus. Don't be like everyone.

The Red Pill is based on the idea that you develop a strong Frame which then becomes a platform to execute skilled Game.

*There is no following in Red Pill.*

**Body**

Let's go back in time to 100 years ago...

In 1918 the **Communists** came to power in Russia.

In 1919 the **Nazi** party came into existence in Germany.

At the time there were still many Monarchies in existence so the modern world hadn't really emerged yet and these were the new concepts at the time.

*The unifying characteristic of Communism and Fascism (Nazi) is that the model for the citizen is to be a follower.*

The Blue Pill is our present day emotional indoctrination process which through all the current technologies (tv, news, movies, internet, schools, etc) attempts to achieve **the same goal** which is to create a now *global* citizen who is a follower.

*A follower is a beta...  a slave.*

When a young man comes here to the Red Pill after having first realized that the Blue Pill is a fraud and a mythology his first inclination is anger.  We accept this as the *""Anger Phase""*.

There is danger in this moment.

At this critical point of awakening when the anger is highest the still mostly beta mind is vulnerable to the **Scapegoat Mechanism**. 

http://www.iep.utm.edu/girard/

Here it's possible to block the path of self improvement through the Red Pill and redirect the energy of all that anger toward a third object.

What does this do?

Well, it halts the Red Pill enlightenment process because the beta in the Anger Phase gets his emotions directed away from the real issue which is that the error was *being a follower in the first place*.

**Conclusion**

Following is central to all suppressed consciousness ideologies.

Red Pill makes a blanket statement that **we do not follow**.

This even applies to the Men's Rights Movements.

Why, I don't know.*

You guys getting outraged at the recent post about a guy fucking his best friend's wife are revealing **how little you know about women.** Women are not just capable but eager to engage in the most degraded shit. TRP is about realizing the TRUTH about women and the world, not about your morals.

You might think the following is just a humblebrag, but there are Red Pill lessons embedded throughout.

&nbsp;

How I pulled a long con seduction on my wife's best friend (now best enemy) and my best friend's girlfriend, and **put ZERO effort into it.**
-

This happened many years ago. Sweet Tits moved to town, needed a place to stay, and glommed on to my best friend and moved right in. What was the rush, she wondered later when she met me, but it was too late. So she spent the next year having to watch me go through a roster of every hot chick in the scene. All she could do was offer sexual innuendo, in which I was glad to partake.

When I heard that she reported significant ""sexual tension"" between us (really?) I knew it was just a matter of time, and I didn't particularly care how much time.

I moved away, but we still visited all the time (he was my best friend, and she became my wife's best friend) and over the years, the sexual tension remained. The greeting hugs and the goodbye hugs got longer and closer. She can't make a move, for fear of rejection by all three of us. Meanwhile, I find the situation hilarious.

TEN FUCKING YEARS LATER, I drop them off at the airport, and the goodbye hug includes side-boob, which she offered. And it's on.

TWO FUCKING YEARS LATER, she leans over to pick something up and shows me, not just cleavage, but the entirety of her sweet tits. *But,* she senses I didn't see (I did) because I might have been moving a magazine in front of me. So she leans over to *pick up the same fucking thing* to show me everything again.

The poor thing is in agony, and I'm not a cruel person; her boyfriend my best friend is out of the picture now. Milling about the house, we round a corner into each other. Eyes meet. **I just pulled her in for a kiss.** We had a laugh about the side-boob, from 2 years before; of course she remembered.

The fact that everybody else was right in the next room was apparently not a problem.

Some general advice for this kind of situation: **the first order of business, after the initial kiss, is a blow job.** Or two. Not intercourse first. I'll have to think about it and figure out why, but that's the way it is.

So, the next day, while everybody else is lounging outside, I ask/bet/challenge her: can you make me cum in two minutes? Yes, yes she can. 

Next order of business is the natural act, but I don't make any actual plans for it -- as I said, **I put ZERO effort in.** I tell her to meet me on campus after I'm done teaching. She arrives in a long flowing skirt. Carrying a blanket. In the middle of the day, we go lounge in a nature area, not secluded, about 30 meters from sidewalks full of eager young students. 

In full view of whoever wants to see, she undoes my pants and gets on top of me. She's not wearing panties. With the skirt draped over me, it might look innocent, but the way she was moving was pretty obvious.

That's how it began, and it ended shortly after, in her sister's bed. 

But not before my wife came downstairs in the middle of the night to see us on the sofa, with my arm around her. How do you get out of a situation like that? You play innocent, say it was nothing. Wife regularly brought that up to get mad about whatever, I eventually gaslighted her into thinking she imagined it. LOL

&nbsp;

I want to emphasize this lesson with the articulate words of /u/dr_warlock . 

> Most people won't upvote because it's not relateable. This is the SMP most will never see. Between the humble brags (it was but who cares), there's an underlying theme... **what women are willing to do vs what they and society have you believe.** Always good to have posts that remind you of it.

Think about what this woman was willing to do: cheat with the husband of her best friend; blow job in the house with everybody right outside; first sex is in broad daylight in public; last sex is in her sister's bed.

I love em raunchy like that.

-- James Fenimore Cooper, The Pathfinder, 1840 

The natural beta is insincere, untrustworthy, self-serving.  These are some of the survival techniques his reptilian brain came up with.  You can see it in the eyes, in timidity, in the limp handshake, the poor posture.  You can knock over a beta's disguises with the wind of a butterfly's wing.  You can blow his frame with a look.   No they aren't necessarily bad people.  But they are unpredictable and therefore about as safe as keeping a monkey as a pet.  They set their boundaries with a flamethrower and are dangerous when scorned.

This is no cause to wrong them.  But I have in spades and they handed me the keys.  

The first time was when I myself was still pretty blue pill but had some solid alpha tendencies.  I was probably about 26 and married 5 years.  I met a man, we'll call him Dave, while moonlighting at a convenience store.  Dave was a gigantic fat turd.  He simpered like a child, shook hands like a noodle, had nothing intelligent to say, grinned endlessly. Then he says ""My wife is picking me up later.""  

""Wife."" I thought.  ""I will have sex with her.""  Not as a plan, not as an expression of arrogance or hubris.  But as an immediate instinct.   Even without redpill theory my gut told me that this man couldn't possibly satisfy a woman.  And I knew I could.  She comes in, she's not too bad, a chubby 5 by my standards today.  A hole and a heartbeat by my standards then.  My wife gave it up all the time and with enthusiasm, but I had the 7 year itch that never went away.  And remember, I'm literally Hitler.  I love to cheat and  I love when women cheat with me.  It's white hot sex of the highest tingles.

So I befriend Dave.  I get invited to his home once or twice.  He's a ridiculous clown, though congenial, and his wife is pretty bright.  I seduced her a few weeks later.  While he's passed out in the bedroom I had her bent over a chair.  She became a fairly regular and to this day, a decade past his divorce Dave still doesn't know.  He was fired from the convenience store for frequent theft.  

Fast forward 14 years and I have several more of these events under my belt.  I encountered and befriended weak men who gave me all the clues of a horny and available wife and took full advantage with incredible ease.  They weren't just easy, they were low-hanging-fruit.  Each man turned out to be dishonest and self-serving.  Skipping the details because you get the picture.

Right now rent in the East Bay is ungodly so to save dough I rent a room.  Last week I interviewed for a nice room in a large home with a younger couple in their mid 30s and a few kids.  She's the talker.  She directs the interaction.  He's just.. There.  I tried to engage him in discussion but he lacked presence, misunderstanding the simplest questions and having a generally dead and vapid demeanor.  He smirked constantly.  He was short and pale and turned out to be a simple laborer and hardly proud to announce it.  His handshake was pathetic. 

 His wife is a slim Asian 6 who could not lay off of the hardly subtle IOIs while he sits there, grinning to himself about whatever might go on in the mind of a beta maggot, totally unaware.  I detested his weakness and the wild animal in me wanted to non-figuratively eat him.  When my friend later asked about the potential roommates I said without much thought ""He's a pussy and she needs to get fucked.""  Instincts again. 

I got and accepted for the room.  OK we know by now that this was a stupid idea.  There were great flowing red flags everywhere and like a bull I charged at them... Hey it's a good place and the ""amenities"" look fine. 

I had her on her back on my Ikea twin memory foam mattress on the 3rd night. I made no effort other than to offer to show her my fishbowl.  

Since I am in fact literally Hitler now you may be happy to hear I got my just punishment.  It's the 5th night and I was just asked to move out at the end of the month.  ""We're just not sure it's going to work out.""  I guess my leaving at 6 AM and coming home at 9pm and going to bed is really tough on them.  Or maybe it's something else making the happy couple uncomfortable.  

Bonus: the inherent dishonesty of the natural beta.

When he laid the news on me he chose to do it on the phone.  I wanted to needle him a little, toy with the situation.  Maybe even manipulate a better situation.  I quickly gave up on the latter idea and proceeded out of sheer amusement with discussion.  

""Why, what's wrong.""  

""We're just not comfortable with you.""  

""You brought me in under the pretense of long-term month to month.""  

*arrogantly*- ""That's not on paper."" 

""I think you should at least have the courage to give me a solid reason."" 

*smarmily* ""Maybe it's the way you're talking to me now.""

Pause.  What a fucking worm.  

""Ok then, well that's that. I'll get out ASAP.""  

""No you can have 2 months.""  

""No thanks, I'll take the pro-rate instead.""  Got him to sign an agreement to pro-rate just in case.  Sleazy cunt. 

You'd think I'd be ashamed but I find it hard to see weak men as people.  I'm still compassionate, I AM compassionate.  I feel for these sorry saps.  But this is the way of the world.  If a predator eats you it's because you suck at dodging and you deserve it.

A married beta has a cheating wife.  Fuck her.  He deserves it.

Things have been great, she does stuff for me without asking, sex all the time, everything you can ask for in a girl despite me being a bit of a pussy. 

However there were two problems. She was sometimes very bitchy with me, and one out of three times we had sex she didn't seem very into it. Not that she was repulsed, but she would talk about other shit while I was inside of her. This pissed me off more than the bitchiness.

Fast forward to a few months after discovering the RP, and all that has changed. I lift and box 5x a week. I try and lead whenever I can. I hold frame whenever I can. I apologize less. I called her out on her bitchiness and after a 2 day fight where I held frame (with the mindset of, if we break up she wasn't right for me anyway) the bitchiness has stopped. 

I put myself first while still being fair to her, and especially after the fight it is clear that if I am unhappy with her or the relationship I will leave her, even if it hurts. 

The sex nowadays? Off the fucking charts. From all the other shit ive been doing shes already more into it, but the last time she tried to talk about other shit (not being focused on the moment) I put my hand over her mouth and plowed her. I've never heard her moan like that in my life. When I took my hand off she told me to ""do that again."" 

This was the sweetest, most innocent girl I have ever met two years back. Now? She's still that sweet innocent girl but she's my slut in the sack. I even told her that :).


Thank you RP.

34,Women's suffrage is the worst thing to happen to Western civilization: Allowing women voting privilege. We were warned,0,0,0,1dok0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1dok0q/womens_suffrage_is_the_worst_thing_to_happen_to/,110,1367711025.0,"Over a century ago, anti-suffragists knew what would happen if we gave women the same voting rights as men. [We are now reaping what was sown.](http://imgur.com/q2X4ybd,m4VDigT,dsZBAGn#1) I will list some of the early arguments made against women voting. Its scary how accurate our red pill fore fathers were, back when politica correctness was considered a bad joke.

- All government rests ultimately on force, to which women, owing to physical, moral and social reasons are not capable of contributing.

- Women are not capable of full citizenship for the simple reason that they are not available for purposes of national and imperial defence. The effect of introducing a large female element to the electorate would undoubtedly be to weaken the centre of power in the eyes of these dependant millions.

- Woman Suffrage is based on the idea of the equality of the sexes, and tends to establish those competitive relations which will destroy chivalrous consideration.*The physical nature of women unfits them for direct competition with men.*

- Women would be corrupted by politics and chivalry would die out

-  If women became involved in politics, they would stop marrying, having children, and the human race would die out

- Women were emotional creatures, and incapable of making a sound political decision

- “Women’s role is in local affairs.”

- Women are already represented by their husbands.

- It is dangerous to change a system that works.

- Women do not fight to defend their country

[Serious concern about the impact of women getting the vote was quite widespread throughout the duration of the campaign. This concern had complex roots bound up with Victorian views about women’s position in society. On the one hand women were considered too precious and innocent to become embroiled in public life, on the other they were thought too irrational and emotional to make an intelligent contribution. Whatever their abilities, their place was thought to be in the home.](http://imgur.com/dsZBAGn)

Women's suffrage is the worst thing to ever happen to Western civilization.

[Suffrage coincided with immediate increases in state government expenditures and revenue and more liberal voting patterns for federal representatives, and these effects continued growing over time as more women took advantage of the franchise. Contrary to many recent suggestions, the gender gap is not something that has arisen since the 1970s, and it helps explain why American government started growing when it did.](http://imgur.com/q2X4ybd,m4VDigT,dsZBAGn#0) Most women, when allowed to vote, vote democrat. Can't get enough of that state assistance. More welfare, more single motherhood. Women don't want to work as hard as men do, but they want more benefits, and they as a rule, will vote for the party willing to spend the most on them, just like they'll beta marry the man who will spend the most on them.

**Feminism is a socialist, anti-family, political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians. When the Senate took up the bill, one member asserted that ""disaster and ruin would overtake the nation.""** Suffrage would lead inevitably to ""government by females"" because ""men could never resist the blandishments of women."" Instead, he recommended that women ""attach themselves to some man who will represent them in public affairs.""

- Female voters, by and large, will be more liberal with the use of government or military force. This is because they are, even today, exempt from the worst of combat duties and potential military conscription

**It was not only because he thought that women were unfitted by their physical nature to exercise political power, but because he believed that the majority of them did not want it and would vote against it, that he asked the House to pause before they took the step suggested by the honorable member for Merthyr Tydfil. He believed that if women were enfranchised the end would be disastrous to all political parties. He therefore asked the House to pause before it took a step from which it could never retreat. **

Women's suffrage is a more dangerous leap in the dark than it was in the 1860s because of the vast growth of the Empire, the immense increase of England's imperial responsibilities, and therewith the increased complexity and risk of the problems which lie before our statesmen - constitutional, legal, financial, military, international problems - **problems of men, only to be solved by the labour and special knowledge of men, and where the men who bear the burden ought to be left unhampered by the political inexperience of women.**

Just when I think I have modern women all figured out; just when I’m comfortable looking any young woman in the eye and telling her where she’s been and where she’ll end up, a new truth becomes evident.

I’m no psychologist, but I am a keen observer of humanity. I also have the Scorpio’s infamous sixth sense, notice behavioral trends, and can boil them down to mathematical formulas in my mind on the spot. 

Though I still won’t pretend to know why women do what they do, I can predict their behavior with stunning accuracy. Nothing pisses off women more than when I pull out the little white envelope I mailed to myself weeks earlier, show them the official USPS stamp proving it was from weeks or months ago, have them open it, and it reads “You have been sleeping with either Jack or Tom. You started flirting with one of them right after I missed your birthday due to business travel”. The postmark on the envelope proves that I wrote it and mailed it before I even left for the trip.


I’ve only done that twice. I’d do it more often, but I’d have to get a second job to cover postage costs with the liars that have been running through my life in the past year. Sure it’s a bit theatrical, but then again, it guarantees a priceless look on her pretty little face.
While the overt stupidity of girl logic reveals itself to me like a two year old confessing to stealing a cookie, the more subtle things they say often pass me by. When a statement does catch my attention – usually revealed by her using her thumb to rub her index knuckle, a half- octave drop in her voice, or glazed eyes due to elevated blood pressure – I latch on like a dog to a chicken bone. I’m a very hard man to lie to. It sucks, actually. You have no idea how mentally exhausting it is to know you’re being lied to constantly. I don’t believe in psychic abilities or any of that jazz, but I truly am a human lie detector. In business, its my savior; in relationships, my curse.

Out of the blue the other night, during casual conversation, this girl I’m fucking says to me, “I was single for seven months after Bill...”

I stopped. I know this girl. There’s no way in hell she went seven months without a cock or three because she’s an attention whore who needs to feel powerful and relevant. She, like dozens of other women who have blown through my life over the past several years, was not purposely snowflaking. She meant what she said. She truly believes that she was single for seven months after she got booted for cheating on her last boyfriend (shit just keeps getting better for ole S2 doesn’t it?).

Believe it or not, I’m not always a dick. In fact, if you knew how much crap I let women get away with, you’d probably stop reading my blog. I’ve learned over the years that making a whore feel bad for being a whore is the last thing you should do if you want to get laid. What good is a whore if she’s not fucking you? Nada. So I try to keep my mouth shut, keep the pussy coming, and take my frustrations out in these writings.
So with that in mind I proceeded with caution, and out of sheer curiosity to see if I was right yet again, I gently guided her to tell me what she was up to during that time.

Take a wild guess.

Anyway, that’s when it dawned on me. Most of the time when women say (snowflake) they’ve been single for X months, what they mean is they were emotionally single. Bottom line is they had plenty of cock, but they weren’t receiving emotional commitment or support from any of it. When they get tired of fucking around, they go get another McBoyfriend to stick around for a few months if they’re lucky, and then the process repeats itself. It’s a win- win situation in that she gets to stuff her hole with the cock of the month, but pretend to be a woman of character later when she leaves out the details of what she was up to during her period of emotional singledom.

Brilliant, really.

This phenomenon may also explain how most women can lie with a straight face about how many men they’ve been with. They count the number of boyfriends they’ve had while discounting the number of men who for whom they were nothing more than a jizz receptacle. The concept of being emotionally single actually helps me understand a lot about my past girlfriends and flings who would say “I’ve only had 5 boyfriends my whole life”, yet they were bare ass up on the roof of my building getting fucked against a rather impressive downtown skyline on the first or second date.

I always knew they were full of shit, but I never had a term for it until now.

So there you have it. I know it’s no great revelation that women turn into willing cum dumpsters between boyfriends (thank god, otherwise I’d have to become a respectable man) but I think I’m actually starting to understand the mindset which leads them to self righteously portray themselves as “single” during that time. The fact that they lie about it doesn’t surprise me in the least; it’s the fact that they actually believe their own lies that boggles my mind.

Just for fun, here it is one more time:

I guess “I was single for seven months” sounds better than “In the time between Bill’s committed cock and your committed cock, I filled my time with uncommitted cock from guys who are obviously smarter than both of you”.

Emotionally single. Gotta love that rationalization hamster!",2014-01-04 19:38:32

###The Beta Male clings to codes. 

*“Those who know, don’t say. Those who say, don’t know.” -Buddha*

When I use the word “code,” I mean it in the broadest possible sense. HTML code is just one of many types of code that Betas cling to. Beta Males are scared to face any reality without first consulting a comforting map of it. Betas cling to moral codes, behavioral codes, and language itself. (Language, written or spoken, is just a way to codify thought.)

The Beta Male ultimately misses the forest for the trees. They confuse the map for the territory. Betas are more concerned with codifications of reality than reality itself. A Beta male would rather win an argument than fuck a woman. 

We can observe this pattern everywhere. Quentin Tarantino has many hallmarks of an “Alpha Male” – he leads men to glory, he’s rich, he’s tall, he’s successful. Yet he’s ultimately a Beta male, and one of his key “Beta Tells” is the fact that [he needs to be “right.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsJDy8VjZk) Betas like Quentin desperately cling to a rhetorical code of “right” and “wrong,” and they are utterly unable to manufacture that code for themselves. In Quentin’s mind, if he’s verbally right and someone else is verbally wrong, then he wins – no matter whether or not he’s actually made any profit, or fucked any women.

Another great illustration of a Beta’s need for codes comes in a [recent Buzzfeed video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2umJwt3U90) This is a video of a Beta Male and his(presumably) CC-riding girlfriend. The Beta Male is pulling a next-level Beta Move: Writing a song for his girlfriend after they’ve already broken up. (This video sad as fuck, bros. It’s like posthumous wooing… retroactive courtship. He’s so locked into the role of “Dancing Clown” that he continues to play it even after his relationship has ended.)

In the evolutionary race of reproduction, this Beta has been defeated. He has lost access to a womb. His genetic legacy is uncertain. So it’s a bit incredible that throughout the video’s introduction, *the Beta claims to “win!”*

That’s because he can’t create his own definition of success. He must latch onto a code created by others, and the easiest code to latch onto is the rubric of rhetorical “correctness” (debating skills.) The Beta in the Buzzfeed video is clinging to this code of “correctness” so desperately that he believes the code of rhetorical correctness is more important than the unspoken (and therefore, to the Beta, inscrutable) code of reproductive victory.

Betas cling to codes because they feel a deep fear of their ability to create codes themselves. They can’t create playing fields. Betas must step onto a pre-existing playing field in order to feel like they are winning a legitimate victory, rhetorical or otherwise.

The Beta's need for codes might be rooted in childhood behavioral patterns. When they were young, these Beta Males surely lacked the social skills to round up a gang of neighborhood kids for a pick-up game of soccer. They literally couldn’t create games. If they wanted to play a game, they had to join one created by another kid – frankly, a more “Alpha” kid.

**TL;DR SO FAR:**

In childhood, young Alphas brought the ball to the soccer match. They rounded up the kids and created the game.

Meanwhile, young Betas came to the soccer match infrequently, because they were busy studying. Beta children often concern themselves with codes – usually, that means studying school-provided codes of information. 

In adulthood, Grown Alphas create the soccer balls that people buy at the store. (Or they start companies that create other products.) Adult Alpha Males round up Beta Males and create codes of mission, meaning, and morality for these Betas to cling to.

Meanwhile, adult Betas eat cheetos and work at Oracle as Web Developers, writing programming code to win the respect of their peers and superiors… while Larry Ellison silently thumbs through his money, trying to decide which european model to fuck tonight. 


###The Alpha Male creates codes for Beta Males to cling to.

*“Control the options. Deal the cards that others must choose from.”
-Robert Greene*

Alpha males deal the cards. Alpha Males face reality head-on. Alpha Males create the codes that the Betas require in order to have meaning in their lives. 

If one person had created the entire english language, that person would be the Alpha-est Alpha Male to have ever walked the earth. That person would be single-handedly responsible for dealing all of the linguistic cards that every english-speaking person could possibly choose from. 

Obviously, no one can single-handedly create a vast language like English. But Alpha Males can and do create codes of a smaller scope. Alphas create moral codes, creative works, and tools that Betas use to feel secure in the universe.

Meanwhile, Alphas do not really feel the need to say anything at all. They think in powertalk. They have grown beyond the childish need for codes.

Alpha Males do not need moral codes, linguistic codes, or codes of conduct. They act on instinct and they shape their instincts through discipline. 

Alpha Males ultimately do not even need language.


###Understanding The Red Pill

Familiarize yourself with the concepts of [Powertalk and Straighttalk.](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/11/11/the-gervais-principle-ii-posturetalk-powertalk-babytalk-and-gametalk/)

Powertalk is what they’re doing in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuVJov3BXM0) from The Wolf of Wall Street – the words they saying do not match up at all with their internal thought processes. They’re speaking in a secret language of hidden meaning. They’re also Alpha as fuck, because Alphas are fluent powertalkers.

Straighttalk is different. Straighttalk is fact-based, logical communication. Everyone can speak in straighttalk – but Betas are often limited to straighttalk exclusively.

In nature, Alphas do not need language. As soon as they achieve alpha-ness, they utterly lose the need to explain SHIT. (As GayLubeOil touched on in his recent ""TRP in Context"" post, this was one of the problems with unplugging 1.0) The opinion that accompanies an Alpha-type mindset is that you are not required to explain anything to anyone, and you DEFINITELY don’t need to explain yourself. In a sense, Alphas lose the ability to explain themselves – because they never ever see the need to use it.

However, when dudes make the transition from Beta to Alpha after living in a world of straighttalk their entire lives, they retain the ability to explain themselves in straighttalking terms. That is The Red Pill.

TRP is the cold, bare, harsh truth about the world, laid out in terms so brutally honest that it causes revulsion in people who think and speak in powertalk. Frankly, both women and IRL Alpha Males are sometimes revolted by TRP, because the language of TRP is simply not a sexy language.

If you showed TRP to your Alpha Granddad from the south, he would be like “What the fuck is this horseshit, son? Who needs this shit?” Alpha Granddad has long since lost the need to straighttalk about topics like women. 

But we haven’t. So I will continue to codify the weird realities of Alphas and Betas and Bitches ’n shit. Even though this need to codify the world may be Beta, I’m chill with that. I like to explain shit in an articulate manner in order to help bros lose the need to compulsively explain shit themselves.

So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into dat ass.

Being mean to women is what truly makes them happy.

I keep messing with this girl.

* I call her clumsy and evil and other names.

* She told me she scraped her knee and showed me the cut. I said ""good, suffer"" and poked at it.

* One time after we had sex she said ""Ok I have to go now."" I responded, ""Sexiest words a woman can say.""

* As I type this I'm eating the food she cooked and brought over earlier.

* Next time she comes over she will clean my place.

This relationship is just about sex. She's a booty call and full of dread that each time she comes over will be her last. All I do is use her for sex and give her a hard time. She always calls me mean, yet keeps coming back for more. **I never gave her a penny.**

She just told me she has cancer. She will have an operation soon. I hugged her and kissed her and told her I hope she will be alright. I'm not a complete asshole; I truly do hope she's ok. She's a very nice person. However, I told her that I will probably fuck other girls while she's unavailable for a couple months with surgery. Blue Pill spergs will undoubtedly think this is mean, but she couldn't be any happier to serve such a selfish and dominant man. They have it in reverse: **Blue Pill behavior is cruelty to women.**

Not only does The Red Pill work, but it truly makes women happy. Not that I give a fuck -- I'm all about mine.


**Edit**: She's just a casual fuck buddy I recently started fucking. If she was my wife/gf I'd be a lot more supportive but she's not.

The point of this post was to show that even women who literally have cancer still desire high status men with good genes. TRP does not change in such a circumstance. 

I held frame. But apparently if someone is sick you should collapse like a 911 trade tower. Obviously a lot of people in here have some work to do in understanding how the world works.

She will fuck the blue pill white night after he's weaseled his way into your relationship using classic blue pill tactics and proudly white knitting, saving the damsel in distress.

She will get angry and irrational when you are practical and point out where she was clearly wrong about someone or something. 

She will have a set of slutty girlfriends that she keeps around for nights and weekends she needs to slut it up and feel no shame. They will talk about the big dick's they've sucked, the amount of anal they've had, and the guy they left crying for them to stay. 

She will take zero responsibility for her actions and act like a child when you tell her straight. 

She will love you most when you are away, doing your own thing, living your dream. She will resent you most if you pedestalize her and do nice things for her. She wants to be fucked hard and watch you put your clothes on and walk out the door. Many a man have in her life and she will think less of you if you stick around. 

She will fuck the guy 10 years your senior when you are out of town. 

She will do this because it's her nature.

Don't put pussy on a pedestal.

Even though I don't see eye to eye with Roosh on a few things, I have to give him credit for figuring out slut tells.  

I have compiled my take on the topic, along with some added humorous explanations.  Take this with a grain of salt, not all generalizations are true...but you should assume they are to make it easier on yourself with less self doubt. 

Here they are.  

**Tattoos** (Tramp Stamp?  You have my seal of approval)

**Piercings** (If she can handle needles being stuck though her body, surely anal isn't out of the question)

**Fish Face** (Makes fishy face with lips?  You're golden, play with her tits.)

**Cusses** (Especially if she says “Fuck” or “Bitch” – This means a literal fuck is in order)

**Not Ticklish** (She's been felt up so much she doesn't laugh, but gets wet instead.  Ohhh yeahhh.)

**Drug Talk** (Talks about marijuana, meth or molly?  She can make you feel jolly.)

**Big Boobs** (Motor Boat that shit)

**Shows Skin** (Thats a nice short skirt miss, but where are your panties?)

**Body Hair** (More understanding of men)

**Association with other sluts** (They *do* move in herds!)

**Bisexual** (Rolls both ways, knows how to play.)

**Was in a sorority** (Loves those fratboy Chads.  Be like Chad.)  

**Went to a party school** (Arizona State?  University of Colorado?  She knows whats up.)

**Lost Virginity at young age** (She knows whats up)

**Likes Tequila or Party Drugs** (Tequila makes her clothes come off.)

**Friends with Djs, Promoters, etc** (She knows whats up)

**Is a wannabe model** (Wants to show skin and be “objectified” by the “patriarchy”?  Let her) 

**Talks about sex** (Must like sex.)

**Daddy Issues** (She needs a masculine force of energy.  Give her that with your cock.)

*My favorite due to the irony:* **She is a 'Feminist'** (Feminism is largely a sexual strategy to filter out the weak 
men who give in to her bullshit with the 'aware' men who are able to reject feminism and still be the alpha male they fantasize about in 50s Shades of Bullshit and other rape fantasies.)  

**Tans** (Vitamin D makes you horny.  Look it up.)

**Hair Dyed** (Pink Hair?  You're on, player.)

**Smokes** (Tokes?  Then she chokes...on cock)

**Guy friends** (She knows whats up.)

**Color Contacts** (Insecure about own color of her eyes?  She wants your cock, isn't that nice?)

**Slutty Role models like Miley Cyrus, Taylor Swift or the Kardashians** (Baby lets make a sex tape like that 
Kardashian bitch)

**Wears Hoop Earrings** (Big enough to stick your dick in) 

**Grew Up with multiple brothers** (She knows whats up)

**Went to a Catholic or all girls school** (She doesn't know whats up and wants to find out)

**Loud voice or loud laugh** (Mating call?)

**Is an athlete** (Athletic people have high sex drives.  Yeah, science, bitch!)

**Drinks Whiskey, manly drinks** (Black Velvet Whiskey and Coke?  My favorite) 

**Online Attention Whore** (Ok ok, you want attention, but hows a real life man compare to your online orbiters/fans?)

**Majored in Psychology** (She knows whats up)

**Doesn't object to unprotected sex early on** (She gives no fucks except the literal kind)

**Good at Sucking Dick** (She knows exactly how to to caress the balls and suck dick like a fucking porn star.  
This is a really good talent.)

**Claims to be good at dancing but doesn't do any formal dances like the Tango or Waltz** (She likes it dirty)

**Is a single mom** (Can't get enough alpha.)

**Sex Positive** (Can't get enough alpha.)

**Moved to New York at some point but isn't actually from there** (She's adventurous.)

**Has Fake tits or ass** (Insecure about natural body, equals easy access to said body for you.  Way to go, champ.)

**Is a fag hag/fruit fly** (Hangs around gays, she must like rolling around in the hay)

**Into cosplay** (Kinky.)

**On birth Control** (She's expecting sex to happen at any point in time.)

**Always late to things** (Such a bad girl.)

**Man Jaw or man mouth** (High T levels maybe?)

**Somewhat overweight** (Insecure about body?)

**Her mother is a slut** (Like Mother like Daughter)

So there you have it.  For further inspection, [Roosh plug here](http://archive.is/bIfhi).

She has this Kardashian sort of look. We met online, randomly. I asked her out, she said yes, I took her out for a drink we kissed end of the night, was nice and happy evening.

A week later, I took her out again. It was the day after her birthday, to which she spent it alone. She has hardly any friends, and went on a monologue about how she doesnt spend time with her family.

She then over drinks tells me how she had a friend who was an escort and tried to get her involved in that. She was also jokingly asking questions about girls I'd been with previously. Was very funny but strange, why did she care.

I go back to drop her home, she admits she has feelings for me, we kiss and fondle in my car and she goes on about how she is going to survive this weekend with no money. She asked me for some change to buy a sandwich tomorrow. The girl is in a Classy dress and has zero money to buy food.

The next day (I didnt sleep with her) she left her charger in my car, which I drove to her place to drop it back. A very different girl greeted me. No makeup, nothing. Gives me a little kiss outside her bedsit which apparently is paid for by her Grandma. Insists I cannot go up and says she has cash for weekend, even though I didnt even ask.

We kiss I say goodbye, to the next day on social media tweeting how shes after a ""prince charming"" and she will ""Meet him one day"" and how she has a ""chastity belt"" etc etc. 

She unfollowed me then re followed me despite me messaging her. It hit me. Ashamed of her home. Ashamed to be seen kissing infront of her house. Classy dress sense. No family ties at all. No friends. Its a prostitute. It has to be. Shame as shes actually a fun girl and hot as hell (with makeup on) but I'd advise if shes seedy guys, just walk the fuck away. ",2014-06-30 21:06:07
47,Alpha's Never Get Played,0,0,0,47vtw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/47vtw5/alphas_never_get_played/,34,1456617774.0,"**Introduction**

We often talk of what it means to be an Alpha and that usually involves things like your SMV and it's contributing behaviors called Frame and Game.

But there is a simple litmus test:

*""The Alpha never gets played.""*

**Body**

What does it mean to be beta?

Well, the Blue Pill is the globalist emotional indoctrination process (tv, school, etc) that is gradually suppressing the consciousness of people worldwide.  The ultimate plan is a world of easily programmed beta slaves or as they say ""providers"".  We need not discuss this as it's a given on Red Pill.

So the *first level* of getting **played** is being played by the Blue Pill process itself.  If you failed to sense the Blue Pill is a Game being played on you then you become emotionally connected to your brainwashing and end up a SJW or simply the passive *Nice Guy™* with no clue.

The next level upon which you can get played is when the Blue Pill convinces you to be a **White Knight**.  The White Knight believes he's an Alpha because he defends women and fights for their causes.  But again, he is being played only now the Game player isn't the impersonal Blue Pill emotional indoctrination process but instead an actual female or females.  He still has no clue.

Then there are the PUA players, the guys trying to imitate Game in order to just simulate the behaviors of better men.  This isn't really true Game either because it's coming from a weak Frame.  In true Game play one has a winning offense and a strong defensive Frame.  If your Frame is lacking like it does for PUA's then you inevitably **lose the Game** that you started.  The PUA ends up played and being beta in the end.  Another fail.

Finally there is the guy who has solid Frame and tries his best to play good Game and simply gets outplayed.  All you can do is maintain *Outcome Independence* and accept that sometimes you lose and must do better next time.  The near Alpha is always improving himself and learning from past mistakes.

**Conclusion**

The Alpha is the guy who does not get played.

When a guy who normally is Alpha **loses** it's a blow to his status and if you let that go on it will gradually force you downward.

*So your Alpha status demands that you continue to win the Games.*

But at the same time a single loss doesn't send you to the bottom it just knocks you down a notch.  It's like MMA fighters who go up and down in the rankings only the Alpha status is more abstract because it involves subtle Game awareness.

At this point my mom already told her mom (My grandma) that she alone would be coming since we made plans, to which my grandma said ""Oh, it's just going to be you? Nobody else is coming?"" My mom buckled and said she'll talk to me and my dad.

At this point I told my dad ""Well I don't know, we made plans"", I could tell he agreed but tried to shove in a half-hearted ""Just for a little bit, we can still play pool""

At this point my mom chimed in and said ""Your grandmother asked you to help, and you know she's old, you can shoot pool anytime"". I was about to cave but then I remembered standing up for myself, not getting pushed around, TRP. Told her ""Me and Dad made plans already, fuck off"", then we left.

The fact that I came out of her doesn't mean I should respect the type of person she is, getting knocked up doesn't demand respect if you're evil.

I'm sure you've seen the dailymail articles claiming feminine men win in the dating game...right next to the one that says women are attracted to biological markers of high testosterone.

So in an attempt to put that to rest study separated women into two groups based on femininity; High bem-M and low bem-M. The high bem-M group was masculine and the low bem-M was feminine and presumably more attractive since [a womans attractiveness increases linearly with femininity](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8251-hormone-levels-predict-attractiveness-of-women.html)

This study found that for both groups their attraction to a man for a long term relationships was correlated with his rating on the ""friend"" factor which was loaded with the following positive attributes: helpful, cooperative, trustworthy, good father, wealthy, and intelligent. 

The preference did not change for high bem-M women when it came to short term relationships but there was no correlation between the friend factor and attraction for short term relationships for low bem-M women. In fact the only factor that predicted low bem-M womens attraction to a man for a short term relationship was their score on the ""enemy"" factor which is, in order of importance, ""**threatening, volatile, controlling, manipulative, coercive, selfish, dominant, impulsive**"". Remember the low bem-M women are the attractive feminine ones. 

There was also no drop off point where increasing masculinization was less attractive like there was for long term relationships. Literally the higher the guy scored on those traits the more sexually attractive he was for a short term relationship.

Combine this with the study that says low bem-M women are [more likely to cheat on their long term partner during their fertile period](http://www.ts-si.org/files/KristinaDuranteoestradiolandmating.pdf) and the implications are, to say the least, worrying.

50,"Example of how Sun Tzu’s “Art of War” helped me in a confrontation today, how frame can make you a winner in every situation, and what I learned about our society from observing how people around me reacted",0,0,0,6yvw5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6yvw5t/example_of_how_sun_tzus_art_of_war_helped_me_in_a/,40,1504917322.0,"First of all, sorry if my English is not the best, it’s just my 3rd language. Second of all, this post is not racist and is not about white supremacy or some shit, I don’t give a shit about your race. I care if you are a civilized man or not.

Today I was taking a ride on the subway to go meet my friend and business partner for a drink, and I was carrying a bottle of whiskey(not something very expansive, but not something cheap either).

After I reached my stations, I had to go through a tunnel to get to the restaurant. During my entire walk through the tunnel there was a group of 4 men(ages 18-20) from an ethnic minority who were acting all gangsta and “thug life”, screaming, smelling, pushing each other, walking on the wrong side of the tunnel to bump into people walking in opposite direction, and disturbing pretty much everyone around them( btw, at that hour the subway is full, as was the tunnel), and nobody was saying anything about that( me included, as I was trying to ignore them).

At the end of the tunnel, there is an escalator, and this dudes where right in front of me, pushing each other and acting like monkeys, until two of them fell, right at the end of the escalator. I was about to trip on them… and in that moment I had enough. After I avoided tripping, I was so angry on the situation that I hit one of the dudes on the floor with my foot and started swearing and screaming at them. 

All the people around me were stunned. The other 3 dudes from the “gang” included.
And after that I was amazed by what happened. The guy on the floor who was so gangsta for the last minutes started crying and apologizing while the other dude who was down quickly run away. Meanwhile the oldest dude from the group(about 20 years old) was coming towards me all angry and shit. I just looked at him, opened my arms, with the bottle in one hand, and shout “Try me motherfucker, let’s see what happens”. He stopped coming towards me. What do you think he did after that? He started shouting that I was aggressing them, that I was a racist and a Nazi( well, I called them parasites,  because they are). Suddenly, the gangsta guys turned themselves in the victims. 

The security came immediately( the guard was from the same minority) and aligned with them as they said that I attacked them, and he(the guard) said that he would call the police. What did I do? I said: “Do it fucker, you will lose your shitty job after that.”. All that while I was having my killer face on. I wasn’t talking shit. I knew I had the power to make him lose his job if I wanted. I was pissed off. I was confident. I was ready to fight them all because I had enough with their bullshit. The guard and the 4 gangsta dude where all in shook. Especially as I was so pissed off that I even took the Nazi role that they gave me and started talking about killing them and their families because they were parasites.  I even invoked a historical figure from my country that murdered some of them while he was in charge(not Hitler, I’m not german).
And after that, something I didn’t expected happened. The people around us, who just stayed silent and stunned till then, started speaking. And guess what? They took my side. All of them. The first to speak was a lady(around 40 years old), then an old man, and after that everybody started screaming at them. And in that moment the security guard took away the 4 gangsta boys. 

After that I went to the restaurant and think about what happened.

I just applied the Sun Tzu’s Art of War without even realizing it. If you read something and meditated about it, you will apply it without even realizing it. Let me give some examples:

1: “Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.”
I’m 19 years old and I have an athletic physique even though I’m not all muscle and I can’t say that I’m a good fighter since I’ve never done MMA or something like that. I’m pretty sure there is a 75% that the 4 gangsta dudes could have beaten me up. But I didn’t back down, I hold my frame and I was the first to strike. The dudes got intimidated. They imagined that if I’m so confident probably I’m some Conor McGregor or something. Even though I was outnumbered and “outgunned” I acted strong and they backed down and turned themselves from the though gangsta guys to the poor minority victims.

2: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”
This is the most important thing in life. You must win you wars without a fight. As I did. If I fought I would have probably been defeated and badly injured. Instead I won without a fight.

3: “If the mind is willing, the flesh could go on and on without many things.” 
If your mind is strong you can surpass your physical limitations. If I thought about my physical power I would have remained a beta who runs away from danger.

4: “The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.”
Do I need to say more?

I could go on and on, but I recommend you to read Sun Tzu’s book.

Now, as I said in title, this is a clear case where frame helped me emerge victorious from a confrontation even without a fight. I acted as an alpha. I knew I’m superior to them and they, in their subconscious knew it. I knew I was going to a good restaurant while they where going to their shitty homes. I was superior to them from every point, even though they where stronger physically than me, psychically I have won the battle. I simply couldn’t stand being humiliated by monkeys who are basically just parasites to our society. Why should someone like me(someone who has his own software company and is kind of successful for his age) accept such a disgraceful display in front of his eyes? Why should the civilized man subdue to the barbarians? Just ask yourself this questions.

And now, in the end, what I learned about our society from this?
Simply: the vocal minorities(not necessarily ethnic minorities) have the power just because they are the loudest in the room, while the majority stay silent out of fear( either fear of getting hurt or fear of being called a racist/homophobe/misogynist), but at the moment a man from the majority took action against the minority, at the moment someone had the guts to do what everyone else would have wished to do… at that very moment, the majority’s power was unlashed. They didn’t care about things like being called a “nazi” or shit like that. They expressed their anger. They where happy that they were finally able to say what they where thinking. They transformed from a scared silent flock of sheep to an angry mob in under 2 minutes. That's the power of example. Our society just needs more examples of strong men to heal itself from the shit that it have become.

Now, I think you all will be able to draw your own conclusions from this. 

Being alpha is not about just banging a new bitch every night. Being alpha is about taking a stand and be a leader for your pack. Be like the lion who is protecting his property from hyenas . Be like the wolf who is leading his pack through winter. Take a stand. Take risks. Don’t avoid the danger.

Thank you for your time.",2017-09-09 00:35:22
51,The Wisdom of being Poor when Marrying a Good Girl,0,0,0,574mdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/574mdg/the_wisdom_of_being_poor_when_marrying_a_good_girl/,87,1476314599.0,"**Introduction**

Do not marry an older Cock Carousel™ slut with the Thousand Cock Stare™ and if you are older and with $$$ you should avoid marriage altogether.

But the reverse scenario where the man is Poor and the woman is young, has a low N count and is at her peak SMV is another story.

&nbsp;

**Body**

For a young girl in her peak SMV to be willing to fuck a young guy who is Poor it means that there is a level of Tingles that she experiences by your personality.  On some level she senses your **natural** Alphaness and wants to be near it.

&nbsp;

*You hold the Power position already.*

&nbsp;

Assuming she is a SMV 7, 8 or 9 your choice to marry this girl is not going to be improved upon significantly by another option.

You have **nothing to lose**.

*So how does this play out in real life?*

Well, you marry while Poor and she is at her peak SMV.  You have some kids and start to increase your career.  The money increases to be able to pay for the kids and yourself, but there is **no surplus**.  You stay frugal.

This is difficult for some to imagine...

You must learn to **live cheaply**.

* *Example One:*

I can remember in my own childhood my mother married my father because he was the relatively Poor ""immigrant"" (actually second generation German, but my mother goes back to the Founding Fathers...  so it's relative) and while I grew up we were very frugal about everything.  Eventually we moved to the Upper Middle Class town and we barely could afford to get in. But the whole thing had the feel of an exciting adventure because my father had this Amused Mastery way of defining reality as a wonderful thing.  We physically were Poor in the relative sense, but felt great inside.

* *Example Two:*

My nephew married a ""Good Girl"" at 24 and quickly had kids.  They started off Poor and my nephew quickly increased his career by getting into tech support and now manages a dozen people as part of tech support for Apple.  They aren't rich, but they seem to be doing fine.  They don't buy stupid crap or take stupid vacations.  Generally their lives are very good and they have high levels of life satisfaction.

&nbsp;

***The Counter Examples***

My younger brother married a wealthy girl (which should be great based in some people's opinions) but then did the **one** thing he wasn't allowed to do...  he got a vasectomy.  He ""didn't understand"" his role was that of ""sperm donor"" and he had actually done this vasectomy in secret.  The wife had millions that she was going to inherit eventually so she expected to have a dozen kids and when she wasn't getting pregnant she knew something was wrong.  In her mind his lack of sperm was interpreted as being Poor and a decline from the initial condition. Result: Divorce.

&nbsp;

My older brother married young and Poor.  He had kids.  Things were fine for 11 years then he loses his job.  Result: Divorce.

&nbsp;

**Conclusion**

This is the brutal truth:

&nbsp;

*If you marry while Poor to a higher SMV ""Good Girl"" you can pull off a successful long term marriage as long as you make ""just enough"" to get by, but not ""too much"" to allow the woman to be spoiled.*

&nbsp;

Women need to feel things are either remaining frugal or slightly increasing.

Once you understand this you see why **being rich in the beginning** is a bad idea.

If you have $$$ you must never marry.

&nbsp;

*It is far better to start Poor and climb than to be Rich and fall.*

The song ends and a new one begins, I tell her we're dancing. We dance, flirt, and get physical on the dance floor. I telll her ""let;s have a drink"" and she follows me to the bar. 

All of a sudden I look back and I don't see her. I look around - nothing. I finally look up and see her on stage with the live music - the lead had given her some fucking instrument to play.

I got myself a water and just laughed at the hypergamy at play. I was annoyed for a second and then realized; women only date/fuck up. It took the dude in the room with the most social proof to get the chick. It was amusing to see TRP in the real world.

The time is the 1930's. The place is a [dark urban alleyway](http://thedetectivechannel.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/images/detective.7691530_std.jpg) next to a dead hooker. 

Likewise there is a place for yoga pants and that place is the gym and wherever you go to eat after the gym. The stipulation being that you are not allowed to wear heavy makeup and yoga pants at the same time. 'But like that's racist against women!"", Sandra objects while flipping her bleached hair. Regardless of what you do in the gym, the whole point is to force your body to adapt. The only way that's happening is if you train with very high intensity. If you can [text while doing your workout](http://www.visualphotos.com/photo/2x4827489/woman_on_treadmill_text_messaging_on_cell_phone_BLD086963.jpg), your doing it wrong and don't belong in the gym, and you don't deserve the honor of wearing yoga pants.

**But like Yoga pants are comfortable** All workout clothes are comfortable that's the whole point. My [stringer tank](http://www.npc-wear.com/colorpics/Stringer_athlete.jpg) is comfortable because it lets my lats do their thing. However, I would be a huge douche if I let everyone in my law school see my sick chest separation. Women, however have no problem parading their visible cunts into Civil Procedure. 

**Yoga pants are sexy!** If displaying your labia in front of the general public is your definition of sexy, you are probably an american woman. Feminine clothes like sundresses are sexy, an anatomy lesson on the location of the clitoral hood is not sexy. 

**Yoga Pants are Lazy:** Men wear fedoras because they think is a cheap easy one size fits all way to show  sophistication and class without having to reevaluate their wardrobe. Its an obvious, unfashionable move to get attention. Look at me because the thing im wearing! Plus, if you're a man and you wear your hat indoors, you don't even know the man-hat rule. I hereby confiscate your fedora. A woman exposing [her genitals](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqXi8WmQ_WM&feature=kp) is an equally lazy unfashionable move to get attention.

**Compared to Europe America is a fashion hellhole. Don't diss the fedora if you are wearing yoga pants or Juicy rhinestone sweatpants, y'all both lazy cunts.**",2014-02-10 11:32:36
54,Budget bulking for skinny dudes.,5,0,5,72uurg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/72uurg/budget_bulking_for_skinny_dudes/,120,1506570919.0,"SMV for men means having some mass.

Naturally skinny dudes have it rough.

The truest, best, and most common advice you'll hear is ""increase your calories to 3000 per day"".

Hard gainer here. 6'2"" tall, 180 lbs.

A month ago I was 170 lbs.

How 10 pounds in such a short period?

Simple. Been doing a ""pasta + 1"" bulk. I eat a ton of pasta each day plus one other meal.

It's easy to hit your caloric goals and also delicious.

Here is my recipe for ""poor man's baked ziti"".

**Daily shopping list:**

* $1.00 - 16 ounces of pasta (ziti or rotini)
* $1.50 - 24 ounces can of marinara
* $2.00 - 24 ounces tub of cottage cheese

**$5.00 after tax, per day**

Recipe:

Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add a splash of cooking oil.

After the water is at a rapid boil, add half the box of pasta.

Bring the water to a boil once more (should take less than 60 seconds) and then turn the heat off. Let the pasta sit in the water for another 10 minutes. The residual heat in the water will cook it further.

Drain the pasta and set it aside.

Grease the inside of a skillet with cooking oil.

Pour the pasta into the skillet.

Scoop out half the tub of cottage cheese on top of the pasta in a thin-ish layer.

Ladle half the can of marinara evenly over the top of the pasta/cheese.

Cover the skillet with a lid or tinfoil and let it cook for 20 minutes on low-medium heat (3/10).

Ok, it's cooked. Put on a movie and stuff your face. Relax and take your time eating.

Do this twice a day.

You need to eat the whole box, the whole can, and the whole tub, each day.

**Caloric breakdown:**

* 1600 kcal total - 16 ounces of pasta (ziti or rotini)
* 660 kcal total - 24 ounces of cottage cheese
* 300 kcal total - 24 ounces of marinara

**2560 kcal overall**

I make up the other 400ish calories with a peanut butter jelly sandwich or a cream cheese bagel each night after the gym.

3000 calories is easy to do on a budget.

**Protip:**

Pasta every day can get sort of monotonous. Flavor it differently on different days and you'll love it.

My favorite marinara brand is ""Hunt's"". It comes pre-seasoned and there are literally 10 different flavors. Buy one can of each flavor and change up every day.

Spices are your friend. A $1.00 shaker of Italian seasoning makes all the difference. One shaker of seasoning will last you a month. Garlic powder and black pepper are tasty too. You get the idea.

Parmesan cheese runs about $3.00 per bottle and one bottle can last a week.

My favorite way to make the pasta is to prepare it as above, but in a baking dish with Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. A 12 minute bake at 350 degrees on the top oven rack crisps up the pasta tips around the outside and browns the Parmesan slightly. It tastes amazing like something from a bistro.

If you're prepping dinner for guests, busting out a baked ziti with browned Parmesan and spices on top will make you look like an Italian chef and the whole house will smell like heaven. Bake some garlic bread alongside it in the oven and you'll look like Emeril Lagasse.

**BAM!**

*EDIT:*

Urine pH two hours after lunch (8 oz pasta, 1/2 stick butter, potassium salt, 2 servings Parmesan) is just under 7. This means no acidosis. Orange full-range paper.

Ketostix shows urine ketones at 15 mg/DL. This tells me that fat is being burned. TruePlus brand.

Glucose meter shows 81 mg/DL at two hours. Jiacom brand.

All levels are seriously optimal.

No, I'm not diabetic, picked up the kit last year when I went full keto for a few months. Now I test once a week.

Got crazy cut at 165 going high-fat/medium-protein/low-carb. Couldn't bulk though, not even drinking 7000 calories of raw coconut oil in a day.

I can tell you that going insanely high-fat and way low-carb (<20g) showed a similar blood sugar profile to what I'm getting now, even though I am now eating mad carbs.",2017-09-28 03:55:19

On an unrelated note, I've been spending more and more time with my lover, so yesterday my wife *confronted* me as asked me if I was having an affair. I didn't admit or deny to it right away but I started a conversation about the state of our relationship, this time was a different type of conversation, I was focused on:

* maintaining *Frame*

* being *Alpha*

* *DGAF*

* *outcome independent*

It was interesting how I remained calm and emotionless throughout and I was able to:

* call my wife's bullshit, when it was bullshit

* control her emotional outbursts, just by calling them

* call out her *rationalization hamster*, just by calling it

* keep the conversation on topic by not allowing her to deviate from where the conversation was going if it was no longer convenient to her

At one point I told her that I am having an affair, that I *care* about my lover but don't *love* her; and that I *love* her (my wife).  I told her that I don't intend to end my affair and that she (my wife) is free to leave any time she wants.

I didn't give in into any details about my affair, she doesn't know who my lover is, how long it has been, my line was always *It will only make you feel bad*.

Then last night wife and I fucked like we've never fucked before, and this morning too she wanted to do it again, a rare occurrence in our sex life, then she texted me that she loves me and she's looking forward to fuck again tonight.

For those of you wondering: 

* no, wife won't be having an affair. 

* Will she leave me? Maybe. I don't care, I've told her that I want a divorce but she won't agree (long story). 

* If she gives me the ultimatum *""me or her""* I will just remind her that I've asked her for a divorce long time and multiple times, she just need to agree to it and we both walk away.  

* In case of divorce my lover would just be *a plate*, as of now I think of my wife and my lover as 2 plates.

**TL;DR: Dread works!**

**EDIT 1:** I love my wife, but I *checked out* from my marriage a few months ago when I told my wife I wanted a divorce.  Through the years I have had affairs, now I know better, it was a way for me to cope with the way I let my marriage slip, a typical pre-marriage Alpha becoming Beta.  My asking my wife to consent to the divorce is a favor to her, to protect her financially and to ease her into a post marriage life; she won't do it because she loves me and adores me, and she's hoping to work things out, but after 15+ years or trying to work things out I have given up, I have swallowed the Red Pill and I have realized that having affairs is not a way to cope with a bad marriage, even one where I ~~love~~ *loved* my wife.",2014-07-08 21:40:19

There's no scientific evidence to support the idea nofap does anything for people except give them a placebo effect.  Whatever positive results people report are likely all in their mind.  

I can start a movement called 'drop hammer on toe every morning', and if I convince people it can help them improve their lives and they follow my advice, some or even many people will report success and keep dropping hammers on their toe.  People who get the placebo effect will join /r/nofap and convince others, and people who got nothing out of it won't, meaning the subreddit is a classic case of selection bias.

Since there is no evidence supporting nofap, I think it's highly questionable to suggest to men struggling to get laid that they should deny themselves sexual release.  Their lives are already fucked up, and they can better themselves in so many other ways, like lifting.

People can get psychologically obsessed with anything, gaming, porn, drugs/alcohol, TV, religion, etc.  If you have an unhealthy obsession with something, you might want to consider cutting back, but please don't delude yourself about the efficacy of denying yourself simple pleasures.

If you tried nofap and got something out of it, great, but realize it's likely not the nofapping itself that did anything for you.  You did it yourself, mind over matter, cogito ergo sum.  And that's ultimately more empowering than relying on the lie of nofap.

TL;DR:  There's nothing to support the theory that porn rewires the human brain and affects the dopamine-reward center.  There's nothing to support the idea it can alleviate approach anxiety.  Testosterone levels are only increased on the 7th day of nofap and thereafter return to baseline.  No empirical data supports porn-ED theory.  Porn does not cause mental disorders, people with mental disorders are drawn to porn and tend to get obsessed as a way of checking out of reality and self-medicating so they don't have to deal with the underlying issues they have (like depression, anxiety, laziness, obesity, low self-esteem, etc).

Just to remind everyone of what they're up against, the Treasury just announced they're removing Andrew Jackson from the $20 bill and replacing him with Harriet Tubman, a black female civil rights activist. This has been a pet project for SJWs for awhile - after all, Jackson, who lived from 1767 - 1845, was a bad man by modern standards. He was a roughneck who moved the Cherokees off their land, causing the Trail of Tears. In other ways, he was also a ferocious defender of liberty and a great enough president -called the People's President in his day - that they put him on the currency. Like many historical figures, a mixed bag to be sure. Learn about him here http://thehermitage.com/learn/andrew-jackson/ and ask yourself - Harriet Tubman was a brave woman, but are her accomplishments anywhere close to Jackson's?

While what he did to the Cherokees was terrible, remember that it's not about morality, it's about power. They are showing who the new powers are in American society, and knocking the white man down another peg. Any man of color should think carefully before cheering the move, as where we go, you will soon follow. ",2016-04-21 01:02:42

However, let's take a look at some opinions voiced in the comments about immigration.

> It's interesting to note it was Feminist organizations and primarily-female protesters leading the push for the female chancellor Angela Merkel to let in what is essentially an aggressive barbarian horde. 
*ThereAndBlackAgain*

> The really ironic thing is if those Muslim ""refugee"" types that they rush to defend end up acquiring too much power, they will have no problem putting the femicunts in their place. You think you are oh so oppressed now, how about some Sharia Law and a REAL patriarchy? 
*Polaris382*


> In the past, they let immigrants trickle in, so even the more hostile ones would have time to settle down and feel like a significant cultural minority. This created a lot of pressures for them to integrate into German culture.
Now, fast forward to today, and that's all changed. The mass influx of these immigrants allowed them to create ingroups where they don't need to deviate nor change from their current cultural hang ups. They aren't integrating, nor are they inviting. Today, I actually feel worried at times walking down the street. I have friends tell me about being robbed, I've seen people get punched, and stores actually broken into and robbed. It's crazy -- I'm sure it occasionally has happened in the past, but now it's actually at a frequency where I notice it. It's crazy.
*trpsenator*

> Even if it did get out to mass media and it was focused on, people still wouldn't believe it. The evidence is everywhere that the migration crisis will destroy our culture, but to say so is still 'racist' and people don't want to speak up.
*deleted*


The essence of the arguments is:

* Feminists want migrants since they're naturally alpha a.k.a. *they want to be dominated by real men unlike the pussified beta western males*.

* Europe is being invaded by hordes of Muslims.

* Public security is declining because of them.

* Public opinion is afraid of talking about this issue because they could be labeled ""racist"".

Being German, having worked in a refugee camp, having read as much as every opinion piece on this topic in local/national/european media, this is an issue which I have to deal with *on a daily basis*. There are two refugee camps directly in the vicinity of my college, even one *directly on the campus*. **Keep in mind that I cherish free speech as much as the majority of RP subscribers do**.


_______
I'll start from the very beginning, even with the possibility of going off-topic for a moment: the signing of the declaration of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/). Article 14 states: Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.

Built upon that, the [Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees](http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html). 

Pillars of human rights and a bright and shining example of empathy between human beings, wouldn't it seem?

Now, let's go on, away from the post-WWII-era to the topic at hand, the migration crisis. 

2015 was the year with the most forcibly displaced people since founding the UNHCR, totalling at 59.5 million, expected to be more till the end of the year. Main causes were the were the Syrian civil war, the Islamic State, the ongoing war in Afghanistan, etc. They are well-known. Main hosting countries (with over a million each) are Turkey, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Iran.
[Look up the data here.](http://www.unhcr.org/56701b969.html)

The conditions of living in the refugee camps in those hosting countries are bad. While Turkey, main piece of interest, still has the best accomodation, [take a look at this report.](http://leftfootforward.org/2015/09/what-life-is-like-in-a-turkish-refugee-camp/) They live in tents, have basic access to healthcare and education, but are not allowed to work or set up residence elsewhere in Turkey, plus with the influx of more and more Iraqi and Afghan refugees, the living conditions are deteriorating. Why not flee on, towards Europe? I can understand why. Many people will disagree, but **I think that Europe and the US have a humanitarian duty towards war refugees**. And come to think about it, we aren't even taking that many. Estimations are between 1.3-1.5 million refugees for the whole of Europe. **Now talking about the total population of the European Union, that totals to 0,29%.
Germany is taking roughly a million of them, which brings it to 1,2% of the population.** Plans to redistribute the load between member states are on the way.

Seeing these quotas, I don't think we can speak of an invasion. Just putting things in perspective. *Calling this crisis a barbaric invasion essentially contradicts the basic human rights we have fought long and hard for*.

______

The outer-european refugees mainly come from [Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Map_of_the_European_Migrant_Crisis_2015.png). 

[The perpetrators of the Cologne NYE attacks were mainly of North African Origin.](http://www1.wdr.de/themen/aktuell/vorfaelle-hauptbahnhof-koeln-fakten-100.html)

Yes, both ethnic groups are Muslim, but they are not the same.

[Refugees speak about the Cologne NYE events and give their opinion, which is to find and harshly punish those responsible.](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/fluechtlinge-sprechen-ueber-koeln-es-war-wie-auf-dem-viehmarkt-14012173.html)


[There is no evidence of rising crime by refugees.](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/fluechtlinge-kriminalitaet-101.html)

[Germany toughening up laws to punish and deport criminal migrants.](http://www.dw.com/en/how-easy-is-it-to-deport-refugees-out-of-germany/a-18966170)

[Germany's most prominent feminist, Alice Schwarzer, criticizing the patriarchal attitude of Arab and North African migrants.](http://www.aliceschwarzer.de/artikel/das-sind-die-folgen-der-falschen-toleranz-331143)

**To make it short, the German public is speaking very openly and controversially about the role women play in the Muslim culture and what happens to migrants not respecting the laws of the country.**

To be able to talk about feminism and it wanting the ""alpha refugees"", I really want to see your advanced degree in public psychology, sociology and if not, solid scientific studies which clearly make the connection you are making. I just see wild, far-fetched theories based on personal experiences on the dating market.

____

**My opinion:**

* Assholes will be assholes, regardless of where they come from

* Crime committed by a few members of a ethnic or religious group does not qualify to discredit the whole group.

* Arab men have a different socialisation than Europeans have had. We have to explain these differences to those wishing to stay here and punish and deport those who do not comply.  

* Effective control of the inner and outer borders of the European Union to exactly know who is coming and for which reasons.

* Differentiation between economic migration and refugees.

* Spreading hate spawns more hate on the receiving side.

* ***Empathy, motherfuckers, do you speak it?***

_____

**Lessons learned:**

* Censorship and ""political correctness"" are fucked up. Discussion needs freedom of speech and the ability to think about controversial opinions without condemning them. 
* Think about your own prejedices before posting (Have you met and talked with refugees/muslims? On what are you basing your opinion? Self-reflection is the key word here.)
*  Do not base a discussion about the migrant crisis upon kitchen-sink psychology.

Looking forward to an open discussion - and keep in mind - I consider myself a supporter of RP mentality.

I will do, or try to do , what I said I will do. I do not lie, I do not steal, I am non-violent (only self defense)

If I agree to monogamy, then I am monogamous. It is my principle, my word, my bond, my self. What comes out of my mouth *is* myself, and because I like myself, because I am proud of myself, because I work hard on myself - gym, work, hobbies, study, self-knowledge etc. What person who worked hard this day, who got up early, who took time out to study, who lived a long and full day, what person who was proud of who they are would allow something that did not represent themselves - a lie - to come out of their mouth? I would not dirty my mouth with falsity

Women are not principled; what they say and their actions are **not** related

Their actions/desires are based upon how they feel, and how they feel is changeable. Monogamy, marriage, boyfriend, principles, are *meaningless* to the majority of women, because it is not their driving force. A person with true principles can never be swayed, whereas any married woman can be swayed by an Alpha with the right moves.

Society raises us to believe that women are more truthful than men, the more honest of the sexes, the more righteous. Homer Simpson is a fat lazy liar who is lucky to be blessed with Marge, the God fearing pillar of truth and perfection without whom the family would go in to meltdown. What lies we were told growing up!

The next time a girl tells you ""I have a boyfriend"", remember that if the right Alpha comes along, she will go with him regardless; it is your job to be that Alpha. If your girl/wife tells you she wont cheat, it is only until her feelings change when a higher status male comes along, jangling his car keys, and she will go with him *and* most likely blame *you* for ""making her leave"" because you didnt pay enough attention .... and society will back her up.

ps. I can imagine how this post seems like a guy being bitter, so for clarity id like to state for the record, I have never been cheated on, but I have been the guy who took married women and those who had ""boyfriends"". And this is why I find that women are completely unprincipled! I have never cheated, nor would I, because I have principles!

Absolutes are for feminists, liberals, and children. 

1.They Listen. Dumb girls don't have opinions on things, at least not strong ones. They'll rarely argue, and if they do, they give up on it quickly. Why? Because they have no fucking clue what they're talking about and life has reminded them constantly that when they open their mouths they get made fun of. If life has not taught them this, you get to be the man who teaches them this lesson. 

2.You Get To Teach Them How The World Works. There's no better feeling than saying something off the cuff and casual and watching a woman's eyes sparkle like she's just seen the sun for the first time. Educated and elitist women think and act like they know everything and refuse to ever compliment you or acknowledge that you taught them something. They're too proud. 

3.They Fuck Better. Dumb girls don't over think sex or ruin it with dumb ass questions. They just fuck. I've actually found that it's the smart girls who watch the most porn and ruin sex by grunting and squealing like a drunk pig

4.They're More Attractive and Feminine. They never get caught up in this modern anti-women-posing-as-feminism charade. They stay attractive. They don't act like men and then expect female privileges. They haven't wasted 12 years of their lives trying to crack through an invisible ceiling and then trying to have a family now that men don't want them anymore. They've majored in charm and flirting. They don't surf the internet and post on anti-men sites; hell, most of em don't know what message boards even are. 

5.Dumb Girls put Everything You Need To Know On Social Media. Seriously, everything. You'll know everything you need to know about her within 5 minutes. I can't tell you how many times the Facebook/Twitter/Instagram combo has let me know I had a slut on my hands. Not only that, but when you show up in the car with a favorite song or two of hers sporadically mixed into your ipod, you create an instant connection. Social media is a woman's tool with a trojan horse built into the backdoor. ",2014-01-08 09:37:21

Beyond the personal, I'd like to identify & discuss what we think our collective weaknesses are, so that we can work on accepting, improving and/or mitigating them. But I've also seen masculinity described as simply the absence of feminine traits--so to some extent, do we WANT to have weaknesses in certain areas?

For example, I would say women have a better ability to recognize social hierarchies and subtle social cues than men. This is something I have worked on improving and want to continue to do so, as its advantage is obvious. However, I would also say that women are excellent at maintaining strict levels of cleanliness out of a biological imperative to keep children healthy, and I've noticed that when I have my apartment cleaned TOO well, it's turned off women (quote from a plate: ""do you always keep your place this clean?""--a two-headed shittest wondering if I am either displaying feminine traits or valuing her as 'special' enough to clean before she comes over).

The post referred to something along the lines of abstaining from sex in search of life fulfillment through other means. 

This isn't what The Red Pill that I once knew is truly about. 

What disappoints me is that the idea of ""going your own way"" isn't exactly going your own way, regardless of how you try to rationalize it. It's a form of submission. Someone who has decided to ""go their own way"" has likely experienced some severe difficulties with women to get to that point. We've all been there at different stages in life. 

But here's the thing: By choosing to ""go your own way,"" **you aren't actually going your own way.** You're letting your difficulties and hardships with women overcome your true desires. 

You're essentially saying ""Women are stupid and I'm done with them. I don't need them to live a happy and successful life. I can just masturbate and work hard forever and I'll be fine."" 

Bullshit. 

What if I told you that TRULY going your own way is going after *everything* that you want out of life? That's the TRP that I once knew. Building your mind, body and skills to where you can go after everything that you want. You can become wildly successful. You can maintain your health and well-being. And you can get some goddamn pussy on the side, too. 

Taking the redpill IS going your own way in life, because it's about achieving everything that you want. This lifestyle is for the rare men who want it all. And which heterosexual men don't want to have sex with beautiful women? 

If you classify yourself as a ""MGTOW"" then you've probably already given up - either temporarily or for the long-term. But, my advice is to come back to the dark side. Nothing in life can replace achieving all of your goals **and** having sex with attractive women. 

P.S. I realize that going your own way can be effective in the short-term. Maybe if you're starting a business or just busy with life. But I don't like excuses. I mean there are always opportunities to conquer life, stay fit, and have safe sex. ",2014-09-02 08:58:35

If she's not a widow, she's scum. The statistics for kids raised by single mothers shows all manner of dysfunction (poverty, mental illness, crime) for kids raised by single mothers, but not widows. So as far as I'm concerned widows are cool it's not their fault the dad died, they're not making bad decisions but shit happens.

But single mothers - they play the victim angle like a motherfucker and all the SJWs/politically correct bluepillers make the wild fucking assumption that it's not the woman's fault, revoking all agency or blame from the dumb silly bitch who chose to raise a kid alone. But the sheep don't see it like that, they start making all these wild accusations that the father was probably abusive or violent and that's why she raised the kid alone.

It's presumed the mother is a victim of circumstance even though 99% of the time she created the circumstances she's in not only for herself, but for her kid(s.) And it's presumed the father is an asshole, but most the time he was a horny guy begged not to use a condom and told she was on the pill when she wasn't. So she gets pregnant and keeps the kid. Sometimes these guys don't even know they have a kid until they get a child support notice out of thin air. Then the poor guy gets fucking berated for being a deadbeat when all he did was fuck a woman under the presumption it was recreational sex and that no baby would be born.

If bitches are deceiving guys into fatherhood, and then crying victim when it backfires because he refuses to defer to her deceit, tough shit for her. The only victim here as far as I'm concerned is the child. She tricked the guy she fucked, tried to force him to become a parent, and when he wouldn't, tried to ruin his reputation and extract wealth. That is some fucked up shit. But hardly anybody sees it from that perspective, do they? Naturally, bitches be crazy and society is all jumped up on the sycophancy of feminism and the woman are wonderful effect, so she's blameless and he's just a cunt. People are so single-minded and intent on blaming the father it's unbelievable. If your father is never there for you growing up, there's a good fucking chance that's your mothers fault.

But no, everyone acts like she's this marvellous creature for forcing her kid(s) to struggle for THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. And that the guy is probably some dark triad woman/kid abusing asshole.

It's total fucking bullshit. Very few men are violent or abusive, that's complete lying utter horseshit used to smear the male name and justify the child abuse that is raising kids without a father.

No, the truth is, mummy was somebody's plate/one night stand and thought it would be a wise idea to not use protection AND THEN keep the kid. Her body, her choice, right? Does this oft gloated feminist principle not fucking extend to the responsibility of giving and raising life too?

It makes me sick how everybody rallies to the aid of single mothers and exclaims how hard they have it and how everyone should feel sorry for them. Fuck that. Fuck them. They had a choice didn't they? I mean a whore has a fucking choice to take a pill, or get an implant or terminate. Or a million other things. The kid had no fucking choice to be born and go through all the dysfunction that awaits it. The kid is a total innocent and the mother, a cunt.

I reserve all my sympathy for the boys and (to some extent, the girls) who grow up fatherless and fucking despise the child-abusing fucks that single mothers are. They are total fucking scum contributing to the complete and utter degeneracy of our society morally, spiritually, socially and economically. Total fucking scum. **Again, it is total bullshit that the huge amount of kids who have no father all had asshole fathers who abused the mother/kid when most men in society are complete fucking betas.** That's just not plausible. This is simple female blame-shifting mixed with misandry.

I have 0% empathy for these broads. How the fuck can I when I see how they destroy their children? Only the children are blameless. Their sons are welcome on TRP and their daughters, RPW. If you are the son of a single mother, don't worry. We got you. And single mothers who for whatever reason read TRP, you're like HIV - a fucking pathogen.

**EDIT: just to be clear, that 99.9% figure is exaggerated, it's not exact. It was my way of saying ""the majority"" - do not be so literal. Factor in some context, it's a rant after all.**

Yesterday after a weeks vacation I had ants in my pants. The buzz of drinking everyday, and partying I was bored at home after work. It was 9pm. I read through comments on a post I did regarding where to meet ""non club sluts.""

Many suggested Yoga. So I went for a drive after chilling out, eating and reading I wanted to get out.

I drove down to a yoga place, and right there on reception was beautiful blonde. We flirted like crazy. I asked her about the classes, turns out she lived near me it was amazing.

She gave me the most amazing advice regarding yoga and stuff, and she was 24 and fit and toned. She doesn't drink and hardly goes clubbing (apparently). She looked healthy, vibrant it was astonishing.

THen all the yoga students there came out in force. Happy, chilled, healthy looking people. I signed up to a weekly class. Beats sitting on my ass after work and the gym.

Sadly I got massively cockblocked by the female yoga teacher, so the woman on the front desk will have to be approached next time I go.

Then afterwards I drove to my brothers to pick something up from him. We had a laugh and then I came back.

I upload my tinder etc new matches, new women messaging me, because I drove 20 minutes out of my radius.

My point is I got off my ass, I went for a drive, I cold approached a very hot blonde, and ""met"" new girls on tinder because my phone was on the move.

At times of boredom, or you are chasing a bit of excitement go for a drive. Discover new things. Meet new people.

Without you realizing it, even on a night out, tinder in the background is matching you with girls left, right and centre. Aswell as the beautiful women you chat to face to face.

A good start to spreading information and ideas, even sometimes bringing them together and making them happen. But ultimately the TRP can sometimes be little more than a circle jerk. It happens, as with all things. 

Plus there are those who try to find some ""good"" in the TRP as it applies to society and people. I think that's a waste of time. It's fine to wear a mask of fakeness and deceit while among the masses. Most people can't handle the truth of human nature or its implications and that's we are so ready and wanting to dress it up in ideals and falsehoods that we call morality and religion. 

Remember, humans at their base are animals that follow mammalian pattern by and large. We've just put a fancy spin on being an evolved ape and dressed it up with the artifices of civilization, religion, and subjective morality. 

You need to become the best predator you can be as most people are prey. Acquiring physical prowess and monetary ability enhances your ability to be selective in garnering mates and resources. Sitting on your ass playing video games and eating Doritos is the pathway to heart disease, celibacy, and erectile dysfunction. Look for the smart and easy ways to big things and make money. Let suckers, BP, and betas do the hard work, sweating, and preferably dying. They are a virtually unlimited resource as long as they get their cable TV, sugary foods, and religion on Sundays they don't do anything with or about besides going to a church and thinking that's what god wants while they engage in unbridled apathy to their fellow human beings. Lemmings are at least honest and thus deserve more respect than these types. 

Stop looking for answers in the offerings of professional entertainers, that's what Lemmings and betas do. Start working on creating your own answers and offerings. Start building your skill and ability base. Don't settle in at a company and punch a clock because one day the company many realize you are overpaid and better off being replaced (for them anyways, fuck you). 

The greatest men never settled for a 9-5 or did things the ""traditional way"" (i.e. Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, Temujin, etc. etc. [yes I realize I just named a bunch of genocidal murdering guys, it's how history works typically]). They innovated, took chances, and made themselves into something great. An Xbox One won't do that for you. 

Be the object in motion, gaining mass and energy. When others are sitting in a bar rotting, be at the gym or be learning a new skill and ability. Don't let your employers define you beyond the money they hand you. They are too inferior to matter ultimately. 

And above all else. Only God, a judge, and a jury of your peers can judge you, and that's ultimately up to you to decide (unless God is real, because if God is real, you and I might be Grade A+++ fucked). Worthless people will always seek to have influence and power over your life. Don't let them, there's no need to. If they don't put money in your hand, power in life, or pussy in your bed (and/or dick, hey everyone has their thing), they don't even begin to mean anything. They are worth less than the dirt on the bottom of your shoes. Accept it and take joy in it. 

Life can be hard, life tends to be unfair to most people, and tragedy does await most as well. Have fun, fuck the world, and get yours. Because there is either a God and setup of divine judgment or there isn't. And if there isn't, then fuck those atheists, they are edible. 

One thing I enjoy telling some people is ""I'm honest, I'm ethical, and I'm evil."" Or if I'm feeling really cheek ""the only thing keeping me from becomming a cannibal serial killer is my legal license."" Both of which are sort of true, and sort of false, just depends on the day I guess. 

TRP is where you start, but how you finish? Well that's up to you really. Don't wait on others for answers, at best they'll offer some direction but no results. Because you are the one who creates your results. Detach from the morality around you, and start making your own.",2016-05-10 04:34:43

# 

Such a thoroughly-weaponized and yet nonsensical term.

What men actually *hate* women? Seriously, where the fuck are these dudes?  Sure some men might be frustrated, and yes, even *angry* at women.  But hate? Seething, desire-to-destroy-and-humiliate **hatred?** It's laughable bullshit.

As men, we literally depend upon women biologically for the continuation of the species; hatred of them would be antithetical to our existence. The capacity to express any malice or violence toward women has been so thoroughly bred out of men over the ages **that we instinctively gang up and beat the shit out of a man who hits a woman, even if we've never met her before.** The men who are here on TRP aren't looking for an outlet for hatred or malice; men don't seek emotional outlets. They seek solutions. They seek a fix for unrequited desire. A need for acceptance, and yes, validation from women. It's very possible to be frustrated and even resentful of women because of that unfulfilled desire.  But hateful?  No.

**One cannot truly hate something while desiring it simultaneously.**

Like many terms that are feminist in origin, ""misogyny"" is emotionally-charged, broadly- and ambiguously-defined, and conveniently unfalsifiable.  It's the perfect recipe for **power talk.**  The reality is that what is ""sexist"" or ""misogynist"" varies enormously not only depending on what was said, but what man said it, what women heard it, and how those women perceive that man.  An actual, objective standard for what the term means **does not exist**.

In practice, the only definition for misogyny that women can universally agree on is ""things men do that I don't like"".  Maybe some component of a woman labeling a man a ""misogynist"" is actually rooted in her belief that he hates women, but the true message is in the **subtext** of the statement.  When a woman calls a man a ""misogynist"", what she's really communicating is that that man is not attractive or worthy enough to poke fun at women or ""get away"" with being offensive.  It has very little to do with addressing what is hateful and unjust; it's just women's way of sounding alarm bells at the sight of a man they perceive as bitter, or frustrated, or even angry with women, and thus demonstrably undesirable.  This term is used to make that assertion clearly, but without any **accountability** attached to it (which, of course, is a big no-no for most women).

""Misogyny"" isn't women *actually* being worried that a bunch of men secretly hate them and are out to get them.  It's just hypergamy in action.  It's women sussing out which men are worth fucking and which aren't, and then stating it out loud, but without any overt attachment to the statement.  It's rarely ever an indictment of a behavior itself, but of the man doing the behavior; a feeble and bratty attempt at a character assassination.  Treat it like any other petty insult from someone who's butthurt and emotional, and refuse to take it seriously.  Accuse her of being a Martian invader in a human skin suit, or one of those kleptomaniacs who steals the tops off of spray bottles.

The real tragedy here is that all of this crying-wolf over gendered ""offenses"" misses the forest for the trees, and with real and dire social consequences.  For women, real misogyny, true hatred of that which is feminine, **comes from within.**

The only misogyny that anyone should ever be worried about arrives secondhand, from the collective voice of the chubby, blue-haired masses, bankrolled and publicized by the Great American Church of Consumerism, whose response to rejection from the men they desire is never to look inward and improve, but to bleat long and loud, ""Men are evil. Reject everything they have built for you, for it will only keep you down. Pretend you have a penis, and this will solve all of your problems.""

This voice is the true enemy of women; the true source of the conspiratorial **hatred** which they so fear.  The one that, in the midst of the ever-growing gender-equalist narrative put forth by popular culture and media, the majority of women simply accept and let influence their life choices, because on a superficial level **it seems like it feels right.**  The one that compels them, one Huffpost article, one snide, passive-aggressive comment, and one affirmative action STEM hiring quota at a time, that happiness and fulfillment are to be found in mindlessly struggling against their biological programming, and against a life that would otherwise grant them meaning and contentment.",2018-07-16 23:38:33
69,Divorce Rates: Just 1 Reason Why Women Should Have Never Been Allowed to Vote,8,0,8,1klifn,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1klifn/divorce_rates_just_1_reason_why_women_should_have/,87,1376842966.0,"I believe there is a direct tie between the failure of marriage and the ""right"" for women to vote. This isn't the only issue there is with women voting, but its the only one I'm going to discuss in this post. 

What's interesting is, in recent years the age at which the average person gets married has been ever increasing.

People get used to married right out of teenager hood at the young age of 20. Now people are waiting until they are 25. 

* Marriage Age Chart: http://i.imgur.com/xoYrpcZ.png

You would think people getting married older would lead to less divorce. However, I don't think age is necessarily linked to divorce, nor does it prevent divorce. At least, not in a way that is significant.

Rather the statistics show a few different connections:

* Women's Suffrage and cultural ""empowerment"" is tied to divorce.
* The divorce rate is directly tied to the marriage rate. 

Let's look at the statistics and history:

-------
United Kingdom
--------

* 1918 - In the UK Women's Suffrage was put in place. Women over the age of 30 were allowed to vote.
* 1928 - In the UK full Women's Suffrage was granted and any legal adult woman could vote. 

Now look at this chart and notice when divorce started spiking: ~1918

------
United States
------

* 1890 - The National Women Suffrage Association and the American Women Suffrage Association merge to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). As the movement's mainstream organization, NAWSA wages state-by-state campaigns to obtain voting rights for women.
* 1893 - Colorado is the first state to adopt an amendment granting women the right to vote. Utah and Idaho follow suit in 1896, Washington State in 1910, California in 1911, Oregon, Kansas, and Arizona in 1912, Alaska and Illinois in 1913, Montana and Nevada in 1914, New York in 1917; Michigan, South Dakota, and Oklahoma in 1918.
* 1913 - Alice Paul and Lucy Burns form the Congressional Union to work toward the passage of a federal amendment to give women the vote. The group is later renamed the National Women's Party. Members picket the White House and practice other forms of civil disobedience.
* 1919 - The federal woman suffrage amendment, originally written by Susan B. Anthony and introduced in Congress in 1878, is passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is then sent to the states for ratification.

Now look at this chart and see the first spike in divorce immediately following actions by Women's Suffrage, in particular 1920 right after national voting was allowed for women.

Both Marriage & Divorce now on the decline
----
Did the role reversal introduced by feminism lead to better and more successful marriages? And as shown here: http://i.imgur.com/NsDpdBE.png you'll see that roles haven't really reversed much at all. More couples have both partners working than ever before, but the number of couples where the woman becomes the breadwinner so the husband can stay home - hasn't increased. Role reversals and the ""stay-at-home-dad"" are fiction or fringe cases.

Co-habitation and No Union (niether living together or married) are on the rise. Marriage is now at an all time low per capita, and divorce is in decline, but I believe that is only because marriage is also.

This failure and lack of marriages however, is leading an entire generation of children being raised by a single parent - which results in lower quality children who turn out to be lower quality adults. [TheAtlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/03/the-decline-of-marriage-and-the-rise-of-unwed-mothers-an-economic-mystery/274111/) ran a piece on this not long ago. 

The other problem is that women don't want to marry men that are lower status than they are. [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/trevorbutterworth/2013/06/25/whats-behind-the-us-decline-in-marriage-pragmatism/) ran a piece on this without actually saying it too directly:
>All the talk of recession and culture and cohabitation and education is a way of avoiding talking about the economic collapse of an entire class of American male.

As a bonus, here's some information confirming ""The Wall."" Many more young women are not getting married, but older women are getting married about just as much even with the declining marriage rate.

>In recent years, there has been a growing difference in marriage rates by age and by ethnic group.6 Fewer and fewer women are marrying in their twenties. Among women 20 to 24 years of age in 1975, 63% had married, while in 1990, only 39% of women in the same age group had married. For women 25 to 29 years of age, these percentages dropped from 87% in 1975 to 69% in 1990; rates dropped from 93% to 82% for women 30 to 34, 96% to 89% for women 35 to 39, and from 96% to 92% for women 40 to 44.

[The Wall for divorcees](http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=63&articleid=408&sectionid=2781): 

>Younger women are more likely than older women to remarry, but age is not associated with remarriage among men.

---------------

So how is this last part all related to women voting? Well it isn't directly. But it is related to something similar. Women's cultural influence and social power.

* Under the presidency of Bill Clinton, women won many wars on the home front. The Violence Against Women Act and the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE) were both passed; and women began earning 71 cents for every dollar paid to men, a substantive increase from the decade before. Carol Moseley Braun became the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate; Janet Reno became U.S. Attorney General; and Madeleine Albright was appointed the first female U.S. Secretary of State, making her the highest-ranking woman in the United States government.
* While internationally, women were rising to Heads of State at lightning speed with France, Bangladesh, Canada, Turkey, and New Zealand all electing their first female prime ministers.
* 2000-2005 - Several countries granted voting rights to women for the first time, including Kuwait and Bahrain, and elected women to the highest ranks of state—among the most notable was the election of Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to president of Liberia, making her Africa's first elected female leader. In Germany, Angela Merkel became the country's first female chancellor; Michelle Bachelet was sworn in as Chile's first female president; and in the U.S., Condoleezza Rice became the first woman to serve as U.S. National Security Advisor.
* 2006 - Nancy Pelosi was the first woman elected Speaker of the House in the U.S. House of Representatives, which places her just two seats from the presidency.

So far, since women have started entering official government positions, the only thing that the government has accomplished is marriage for gays and the outlaw of polygamy:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_civil_marriage_in_the_United_States  
While same-sex marriage was an admirable ideal, it only helps out a minority. Nothing has been done in the last decade to support the majority of the population in fixing the decline of straight marriage. The polygamy issue was at worst a red herring, and I can't see why anyone would focus on legislation for that when there are actual problems to solve.

Further [*this*](http://dontmarry.wordpress.com/) is the legal and cultural climate that men who engage in marriage have to deal with today. All thanks to ""empowered"" women. 

In conclusion, Women's Suffrage was the beginning of the end of marriage. In the mid and late 1800s before women could vote, the divorce rate was nearly non-existent. As female influence increased, the divorce rate increased. It reached a peak in 1979 and hasn't come down any quicker than the marriage rate has since.

Expert judges viewing the photographs found smaller smiles among high than low testosterone men, with less zygomatic major (raising the corners of the mouth) and orbicularis oculi (raising the cheeks and crinkling around the corners of the eyes) muscle activity. Naive judges viewing individual photographs gave higher potency ratings to smiling high testosterone men than smiling low testosterone men. Naive judges viewing photographs grouped into high and low testosterone sets gave higher potency and lower goodness ratings to high than to low testosterone men, regardless of whether they were smiling. Among women, judges found only slight relationships between testosterone and facial appearance.

It's a psychological explanation on why more and more men are becoming feminist soyboy bitches. And it transitions right into big tech's current war on conservative/anti-globablist/anti-feminist ideas/thoughts/speech in today's time.

**BEGINNINGS**

I believe for most men, their values and ideology are formed while they are teenage boys in middle school and high school. I think most feminist/soyboy losers are the ones who were outcasts in school, or the ones who would be ""stuffed into lockers"" by the popular kids. They were not a part of the popular crowd. They didn't play sports and they weren't athletically gifted. They participated in fringe activities like video games, dungeons and dragons, band, and other ""nerd"" activities. Their friends were also in the same boat. 

These men had utter disdain for the popular crowd in their school. They were mad the popular crowd got the attention, the accolades, the trophies, and most importantly, the attention of the highest value women. They were mad that the praise went to guys who accomplished things like playing sports well, instead of intellectual accomplishments. 

However, they know damn well if they had the ability, they would have been perfectly fine with being an athletic achiever and winning those trophies, medals, and glory. They are just jealous it wasn't them. 

**THE QUESTION**

""Why the fuck are these women paying so much attention to these jock losers instead of me? I actually achieve things. I get good grades, I participate in sophisticated, intellectual hobbies, and am just intellectually superior to these guys. Fuck them!"" They would think to themselves.

These guys knew they were never going to complete with Chad on the playing ground of athletics, or strength, or looks, or size, or masculinity, or any of that. Therefore, the soyboy realized the only way he could gain the upper ground on Chad was by claiming the moral high ground. They go the ultra liberal, SJW route and now can claim some form of superiority over Chad. 

**THE MORAL HIGH GROUND**

""He may have all the medals and trophies, but I am a better human being because I care, you see""

Now armed with a newfound sense of moral superiority to go with his intellectual superiority, the SJW soyboy now attempts to compete in the sexual market place with this ""ace"" up his sleeve. However, he gets the same results. Most high value women aren't interested. Even the lower value women aren't really that interested. The soyboy can only dismiss these women who reject him as ""basic bitches who don't know what they want"" for so long. 

Instead of realizing the fault in his ways, the soyboy believes its because he isn't progressive enough, isn't feminist enough, isn't ""woke"" enough. He decides to double, triple, quadruple down on his liberal feminist SJW ideology. This causes it to literally become a religion for him. 

**LINKAGE**

The liberal feminist soyboy now links everything he hates - to conservative ideology. The popular crowd at school? They must be evil conservatives. The jocks? I hate them, therefore they must be hateful bigots. He paints his real life opposition in the same light as his political opposition. Therefore, the way to crush them is politically. Not only is his hyper liberal feminist SJW ideology going to save the world and usher in utopia, its also going to crush his enemies from high school. He will finally get his revenge from getting stuffed into lockers by these guys and those guys stealing the girls. 

**THE MISSION**

When your political views are literally your religion like they are for liberal SJW feminists, if you do not hold the same political views, you must be evil. You must be hateful. How could you possibly hold such horrible views that are not inline with my ~~religion~~ political views? Therefore, the mission must be to save the world from such views ""for the greater good"".

You must be re-educated. We must show you the truth. All forms of dissent must be silenced so no more minds are corrupted. We can not have people on this planet with such backward views. 

Tactics employed via the mission are doxxing people, joining groups like Antifa, blackmailing people, running social justice outrage campaigns, protesting, getting people fired from their jobs for wrongthink, and so on. 

If they do the mission correctly, they will be praised by their fellow SJWs and a fawning media. This will give them the glory and heroic dopamine rush they have always craved and missed out on by not being good at sports in high school. 

**THE PROBLEM WITH THE MISSION**

The problem with The Mission, is that its not motivated by compassion. Christian Evangelicals, for example, when they want to preach the gospel and win people over to Christianity, its done out of love and compassion(for most evangelicals anyway). For these hyper SJW liberal feminists, though, its not done out of compassion. It's done out of vengeance. Disdain. Hate. If they win people over to their side, great, but its more about revenge and payback. It's about destroying the guys who they hated in high school. Everything they hate politically becomes a proxy stand in for their high school enemies and oppressors. They are one in the same. This dopamine rush of revenge is far sweeter than the one for nobility. 

**HOW BIG TECH TIES IN**

Big tech ties in perfectly here. Let's be real. Most big tech workers were the nerds in high school. They were the oppressed. They were the ones stuffed in lockers. Now they are armed with all this power. Whether it be reddit admins, reddit power mods, Google admins, Facebook moderators, you name it. They have the power to really make a difference for ""The Mission"" that the normal person can't. They can ban people, censor ideologies and ideas, deplatform people, and silence ideology they don't like. Because they link ideology they don't like to their high school oppressors, it gives them satisfactory revenge, as well as making them appear noble to their fellow like minded individuals and as if they are ""saving the world"". Example, they will use platitudes like ""Muh, if you could have stopped Hitler, muh, would you have done whatever you could?""

I guarantee you the individuals who quarantined TRP and The\_Donald did it because they view us as a representation of their high school oppressors. Yeah, they could brag to their fellow SJW friends and the fawning media about what they did, to get the nobility ""heroic"" dopamine rush that they could never get in school by playing sports. But that's not as satisfying as the revenge dopamine rush they get from it. The dopamine rush they get for finally getting ""even"" with their high school oppressors and the ones who got the girls instead of them.",2019-06-27 05:39:24

Almost everyone has heard of ""cat ladies"" or women who own multiple cats being crazy.

Gentlemen I would like to introduce you to something to always consider, especially if she has a cat or cats.

Toxoplasmosis makes women crazy.  Batshit crazy.  You won't know she has it, only that it lasts a long time and is hard for the body to get rid of.  During that time she will appear to be nuts. Fly off on tantrums, crying, irrational thought, jealousy, you name it.  (sound familiar?)  It affects men, too. It makes us aggressive and also nuts, but appears to affect us less.  The extent is unclear.

If they are outdoor cats, chances are they have killed mice or other rodents. Rodents affected by Toxoplasma Gondii will exhibit weird behavior.  They will show no fear when confronted with a cat.  Normally sight of a cat would send them scurrying.  With toxoplasmosis, they offer themselves as food.  That's how the cat contracts it.

If the cat ever brings the carcass in and/or poops in a litter box or even the bush under the bedroom window, chances are that loony girl you've plated has acute Toxoplasmosis. Run.

I honestly think it's the [root cause of a majority of mental health problems](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090311085151.htm) in the world and has yet to be linked.  Why?  Because it doesn't have a huge affect (death or major sickness), it's hard to detect unless you look for it, and it results in HUGE pharmaceutical sales.  There's a lot of financial incentive for keeping it under wraps.

For those of you who don't know what ego lifting is,

>Ego lifting is someone who sadly gives a fuck about what others think of them at the gym, and loads more weight on the bar than they are capable of handling just so they can be seen by others ""lifting"" as much weight as they can get away with. 

Notice ""lifting"" in quotation marks. Yeah you might be able to do the minimum it takes to ""lift"" said weight, but at what cost? Your form sucks, you didn't do enough reps, you didn't do the right lift, and so on.

I see ego lifters every day at the gym. Doing way more weight than they can handle. Doing curls where they throw their shoulders backward so hard and have their elbows out in front of their body so far that they are getting zero bicep activation at all and turning it into a front deltoid workout. 

Or squatting 1/4 of the way down. Or dead lifting with a rounded back that looks like a question mark. Or using all the momentum they possibly can to bring the bar down on lat pulldowns. Turning incline bench/incline DB bench into a flat bench by moving their ass forward and arching their back. Turning overhead presses into a push press.  You get the idea.

A good prescription for being an insecure ego lifting faggot is to try out the Vince Gironda 8x8 system. 

#8 sets of 8 reps.... with 15 seconds of rest

Vince Gironda was an old school body builder who called this system ""the honest workout"" Your ego will quickly be crushed with this workout program. Because in order to do 8 sets of 8 with only 15 seconds or rest, you can't be doing a lot of weight.

Run it for 6 weeks. If you want to ease into it, take the first week and do 30 seconds of rest instead of 15 to get the tempo down, and calibrate the weight you can handle. Then in week 2, go down to 20 seconds. Weeks 3-6, 15 seconds. I guarantee you the initial weights you choose will be too heavy. That's how it was for me. You think you are picking a light weight, and then you realize you can't finish the 8 sets of 8 and have to go lower next time. 

It's not just 8 sets of 8, its 8 sets of 8 with good form. If you have to compromise your form at any point except maybe the last rep or two on the last set, its too heavy. 

Barbell curling 20 pounds? Dumbell curling 10 pounds? Squatting 135? Overhead Pressing only the bar? Neck Pressing only 115 pounds? Having to use the assist pad on pull ups/chin ups? If the thought of doing any of that makes you shudder because *gasp* people might think you are weak, the 8x8 system will put that mindset to rest. I can do 20+ chin ups easily in a single set. But in an 8x8 I have to do them assisted. Oh no, people are seeing me do assisted chin ups, oh no! How will I survive?

Here are the lifts I do when I run this program:

Monday: Gironda Neck Press, Wide Grip Dips, Overhead Press, Lateral Raise, Lying Tricep Extension, Smith Machine Reverse Grip Bench

Tuesday: Wide Grip Lateral Pulldown, Assisted Chin Ups, Drag Curls, Spider Curls, Reverse Grip Barbell Curls, Forearm Wrist Curls

Wednesday: Squat, Hack Squat, Leg Curls, Standing Calf Raises, Cable Ys, Barbell Shrugs

Thursday: Incline DB Press, Cable Crossovers, Standing DB Press, Kneeling Face Pulls, Rope Tricep Pushdowns, Overhead Rope Tricep Extensions

Friday: Chest Supported Row, Assisted Pull Up, Barbell Curl, Incline DB Curl, Reverse Grip DB Curl, Reverse Grip Wrist Curls

Saturday: Leg Press, Glute Ham Raise, Seated Calf Raise, Hang Clean, Prone Press

Sunday: OFF

Run it for 6 weeks. You'll learn how to workout at a fast pace, and perfect good form. I run it for 6 weeks every year, and just got done with my most recent 6 week cycle and its a great way to disrupt your body.",2019-04-15 01:32:50

Chad was a smart kid in school, second only to how popular he was with everyone. He won the genetic lottery and was objectively the best looking, most athletic and physically appealing kid in high school at 6'4"" and 190lbs at 8% bodyfat. The girls gosspied and giggled with each other because he was great in bed and could make them orgrasm with his 7"" girthy dick alone. That girl you oogled at in chemistry because she was cute? Chad fucked her.

In college he took home a 9 every night he wanted, had threesomes with them on the weekends for a total n-count well into the 100s (he's not sure because he stopped counting around 90), yet still got a 4.0 GPA taking 20+ hours a semester and playing on the football team.

He's now a major player in the oil and gas industry. As a salesman he took home a million his first year (and his first 18 year old supermodel), won accolades from his coworkers and bosses and was well liked by everyone, especially the coworkers he was banging. Despite every girl he's ever fucked chasing him he refuses to commit thanks to fresh 18 year olds to alpha-widow every year for the rest of his life.

Men get discouraged knowing they will never be Chad. Regretting the years in high school and college, forever losing the chance to be the popular guy and athlete, or blindly searching for power and the way to bankroll six or seven figures in the business world, they give up and resort to a life of gray non-existence.

Yet you're here on TRP because you want to be better than what you are right now. You will never be Chad, but that's okay. Chad doesn't exist in reality. Chad is an archetype of the manosphere's creation. He's the collective ideal we all strive toward (and dangerously worship in some cases).

You will never be Chad, but strive to be like him.",2016-06-02 12:59:44

I grew up to arguements constantly with my parents, which hurt, and I grew up thinking that women deserved great respect in all accounts. 

My aunt (mums sister) would always advice my mum and comfort her when she'd fight with my dad, only now I realise that the aunt is 55 single, never been married and is clearly jealous as she often starts all rifts herself!

Take my two cousins. Both beautiful funny lovely girls. Both 35 years old, no bfs, no marital prospects. Both ended long relationships because they deserved BETTER. Found fuck all, and are both bat shit crazy.

My uncle and aunt got seperated a few years back because my uncle was in fact cheating on my aunt (other aunt). My aunt was left to look after her two kids, to which the older one hates his mum as she let out all her anger on him. He popped the pill at 20 that kid! The uncle got bored, moved back into his house as if nothing had happened. He goes on several holidays a year ALONE. ALONE!

Last week, she broke down in her car, and he drives a nice BMW. He heard about it, and told his son to hide his car keys so she doesnt drive his car as shes an awful driver, and to get a cab and bus to places instead. (He was on holiday!)

My grandfather(lastly) is 83, and my grandmother died two years ago (may she RIP).

However, the man goes to the casino every night. He goes out till 10-11pm and comes home alone, barely speaks english. He even did this when he was married. He got abuse for it, but carried on. He didnt give a shit, and still doesnt. Last week we went to his house to see him before going to wembley to watch the football, he thought he was coming, he wasnt, so he fucked off to the casino.

Now you have to understand, when these things happen, we are told a very different story. By my mum who drummed it in ""isnt your grandfather selfish...isnt your uncle an arsehole she should divorce him....why cant your cousins find a husband?....why dont we invite your single aunt on holiday because shes all alone...""

1. I have awoken, the men are ALL Alpha. They are old school. They get shouted at, argued with, threatened to leave, but they still always get their way.

2. The cousins have gone mad. Their times are up, they wanted a ride on the carousel.

3. My single aunt is an EXTREME example of the cousins. Her fussyness has driven her to lunacy and boredom.

I've just popped the pill. I really get it now. I need to start becoming Alpha and not be afraid of the consequences.",2013-04-18 17:52:54
80,Me Too Guys! Times are a Changing Faster than we know,0,0,0,7m92wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7m92wb/me_too_guys_times_are_a_changing_faster_than_we/,122,1514338802.0,"A quick field report.  

I was on vacation last week and returning from Hawaii on Christmas Eve.  We were deplaning our connecting flight in LA, and a short woman in front of us was struggling to get down a piece of luggage.  She looked plaintively around, surrounded by perhaps ten men- and **EVERY SINGLE MAN LOOKED AWAY OR AT THE FLOOR.**

My wife was still sitting and she crossly demanded that I help the woman- ""Blue, she needs help getting her bag down.""

I shrugged and quietly informed her that I did not want to get charged with sexual harassment so she was on her own.  One of the men in front of me nodded vigorously and my wife frowned deeply.  She was no taller than the woman but she got up and tried to help her and, of course, she could not reach the bag either.

""Can you help PLEASE!""  She demanded.

I smiled grimly:  ""Of course I will help YOU, my dear, but I don't know this woman or her intentions."" Then I darkly muttered ""Me Too Darling.  A man's got to protect himself from toxic femininity"" as I took down her bag and set it in front of the woman without even a glance at her.  This time I was loud enough for everyone around to hear and several of the men continued to look at the floor while grinning and nodding.  Several of the women looked at me with piercing eyes full of hate and fear.  I calmly shrugged my shoulders.  Pray tell exactly how these bitches expect men to react!

I have flown regularly for many decades and I have never witnessed a scene like this.  A woman desperately needed help and all the men around her simply looked away and refused to help.  Then all of the men nodded and smiled when I said the magic words ""Me Too.""

Women are programmed to push men and push and push and push and push.  Men are supposed to stop them.  However, at some point an individual woman pushes her husband just a bit to far or, as in this case, the group of howling feminazis as a whole have pushed men as a whole too far.  In either case the response of men is not to fight back or hit the women, or grab them by the POTUS.  The natural response of a man who has been pushed one step to far is to withdraw.  Like a husband denied sex one to many times by his wife, or talked to with disrespect one to many times, men today are withdrawing from women.  

Men today are consciously limiting contact with women.  Increasingly we don't talk to them.  We don't even make eye contact.  If they need help we fight our White Knight urges to help the ""fairer"" sex and instead  look at the floor and remember toxic masculinity.  We remember Me Too.  We remember the ungrateful, pushy, demanding, bitchy, cunty women exhibiting toxic feminism, treating us like second class citizens, denying us jobs in favor of affirmative action, and constantly testing us in never ending and escalating ways.

We are looking at all this and increasingly men are saying:  ""Nope.  I am good.""

TLDR: # ME TOO is working!   # MGTOW4LIFE

Edit:  I reviewed this with my wife and she noted that the woman asked 2 men for help and they ignored her.  That was why she was so compelled to jump in and help- and it makes my point even stronger!  There is a response brewing and men are sick and tired of ~~this shit~~ women.

Edit 2:  I thought this scenario sounded familiar.  Dalrock wrote about this in 2014:

81,Child<Woman<Man<God,0,0,0,2vo6od,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2vo6od/childwomanmangod/,49,1423791670.0,"Sometimes I find it helpful, when dealing with women's irrationality, pestering, disobedience, and outright malice to think of the hierarchy in the title of this post.

For the definition of God, if you don't believe in any particular God, then use the definition of ""existence itself"" which is something you obviously can't deny--that existence exists, and that it precedes and is the necessary condition for all other things.  It is the essence of being, and makes a good philosophical placeholder for anyone who doesn't believe in any other understanding of God.

How much do we rely on God?  Or, again for atheists, how much do we rely on existence existing?   Completely and 100%.  We have nothing, we are nothing without God/existence.

This is reflected in the way a child thinks about its parents.  And especially its mother in its earliest years.  If they are out of the room, it is an existential crisis.  We can understand that.

And yet, we often have difficulty with the notion that woman's being is fundamentally as dependent on man, as a child's is on its mother, and a man's is on God/existence. (Naturally, woman and children need God/existence, too… it's a flow-chart.)

But I find this analogy can help explain the way women shit-test and say  things irrational and horrible to men.

Have you ever cursed God?  Cursed the day you were born?  Cursed the evil in the world, for which you place the blame on God, when the real culprit was Man?  Blamed God for all your shortcomings, like a whiny feminist blaming men for all of hers?

Said, or thought to God, if you do x, I'll believe in you.  If you don't, I won't.  You are more powerful, but it's only by the standards of MY tests that you should prove yourself.

Have you ever thought that existence is inherently evil or absurd?  And railed against the absurd universe, spouted off to your friends with existential angst… yet another day, you beamed in some euphoria, understanding that all existence is pure and good and you are part of it?

Are you not like a woman who hates men, and loves men.  Says she doesn't need them, and cries for days when they ignore her?

And isn't she coming to you like a child crying for Mommy?

(And did not God perhaps, for love of woman and man, come into existence as a child, through woman, to become a man, sacrificing all to  be glorified as God, making a full cycle?!)

Anyway, this is just a thought that helps me understand women better.  I wanted it to be accessible to believers and non-believers alike, because I think it's true and makes sense in the order of existence.

How many children want to be taken for big boys and big girls?  To be treated as adults?  Yet it is ridiculous when they try.  They can never do so until they grow into that.

And how many men want to be seen as Gods?  Yet their efforts are ridiculous!  A big apartment and a swimming pool.  An expensive car.  Leading a company.  Can that compare to the creation of the universe?!  We know these men are fools.

And yet how many women want to be taken for men?  Strong, rational, reading a Sheryl Sandberg book, aspiring to be a CEO, because that's what a man does.  They have no idea what a man does and they are just as ridiculous for trying as a child putting Mommy's sports bra on their head so they can dress up as Mommy.

And when a woman wails and cries against YOU… not against children, nor against God, but YOU… it is because she feels as you do when you rail against the cruel indifference of the universe, or the unanswered prayer.

While you do whatever it takes to conquer the world, no holds barred, take no prisoners because the competition is tough… that is just how she will take it to YOU, to find her meaning by conquering you.

But to be conquered by her is like her being conquered by a child.  It would show she was weak and backwards.

Thinking of this ordering, putting man and woman in the context with children and God(/bare existence) helps me see myself and my flaws in what women do, without seeing our flaws as equal.  They are just a reflection.  And her struggles with me are like my struggles with the highest order of the universe.",2015-02-13 01:41:10

What truth? The red pill truth! 

**SPOILERS AHEAD**

I've read every book, and they've provided useful insight into relationships. In the first scene, Bella (the main character), moves to a rainy town in Washington state. Right off the bat, she gets a beta orbiter, Tyler. She's immediately not attracted to him, and friendzones him. But next, she spies Edward, who she notices has a dark triad complex. Seriously, he's attractive, muscular, and most importantly, is rich as fuck.

He drives a Volkswagen to school. Lots of social status here! She starts becoming infatuated with him when Tyler almost hits her with his van, and Edward saves her using his incredible muscles. He leaves, (dread game time), pretty much ignoring her for huge amounts of time. Edward actually starts stalking her around at this point, watching her sleep. Yet she doesn't view him as a creep, (because of all of his alphaness) and proceeds to date him.

She clings to Edward for emotionally support throughout the series, attracted to the danger of him being a vampire. James, however, comes in, wanting to hunt Bella. He's the beta orbiter stereotype right there, no status, nowhere near as attractive and muscular. Constantly stalking her around, no life of his own. James is what not do be, he pretty much pedastalizes her as the ""perfect game"". 

James steals Bella, and then gets killed by Edward, who saves her. This part isn't very important, but the next book is a study of AFBB.

Bella gets a paper cut in New Moon at her birthday party (the book after Twilight), causing a vampire to try to attack her. Edward and the rest of his family move away now, because it's really dangerous if a vampire almost kills you because of a paper cut. 

Bella wants Edward back so much now, she jumps off cliffs randomly! She now meets Jacob, a really, *really*, nice guy, who comforts her throughout her ""agony"", and is overall a beta. He loves him, as a friend. Gotta love what happens next, because Jacob is now turning into a werewolf and leaves Bella to become a muscular, alpha (he is supposed to be an actual alpha in a wolf pack), high status (of course), werewolf! Bella suddenly becomes interested in him, I wonder why?

Edward somehow learns that Bella killed herself by jumping off a cliff, which is actually a funny series of miscommunications that culminates in Edward going to Italy to do a ""suicide by cop"" type thing. Edward comes back, Bella fawns all over him, all is happy again, with Bella using Jacob for lots of emotionally support and what not, and trying to get Edward to have sex with her in her spare time.

Edward starts to lose his alpha touch in book 3, when Bella constantly bugs him to go visit her ""friend"", Jacob. Tables are turned, Edward is the beta, and Jacob is the alpha. On one of her visits to Jacob, Jacob decides to tell her that he loves her. That is the shittiest piece of game I've ever seen in a book, and Bella cannot friend him fast enough.

Jacob now goes dark triad (he can't make up his mind), and decides to run around to get himself killed and is a complete psychopath. Bella falls in love with him, even though she just friend zoned him chapters before (holy shit hamster is going to break his wheel).

Unfortunately, Bella decides to choose Edward for her provider relationship, because at this point Edward is a complete beta (Bella did it), and Bella wants the beta bux.

Now, at this point, I'm at Breaking Dawn, the final book in the series. Just when you thought Edward couldn't spend more lavish amounts of money on things, he goes out onto a private island with Bella, (they got married because Edward is a fucking idiot). Lots of unprotected sex ensues, (seriously Edward, use a condom), and Bella doesn't get an STD, but gets pregnant with a vampire hybrid baby.

Unlike all of her vampire friends, Bella's hamster breaks the fucking sound barrier and she decides to keep the vampire hybrid baby. Keep in mind, her father-in-law (who was described as the greatest doctor in the world, non-sarcastically) has told her that the baby will pose a great risk to her and will probably kill her. Never trust a woman to get an abortion.

Through a banal series of events (three phone calls), Jacob is now going on a Rambo-esque quest to save Bella from becoming a vampire. He learns it was all a misunderstanding, because he actually sees her pregnant with a vampire hybrid baby who is now actively trying to kill her by breaking her bones from the inside. Jacob literally begs her to get an abortion. Hamster runs at hypersonic speeds, vaporizing the wheel as Bella tells him that she will ""probably live long enough"" to deliver the baby and then she will become a vampire.

Due to the fact that human-vampire hybrid babies are generally considered as dangerous freaks of nature who will probably kill random things, Jacob's wolf pack sets up an attack to kill the baby. At this point, Jacob starts his own wolf pack because he is sad about killing demonic vampire babies. At this point, Bella starts drinking blood (she is not a vampire yet) to feed the baby. But while she is drinking blood, she falls over, breaks her pelvis, almost every bone in her body, and her spine with help from the baby.

Edward makes her a vampire, and Jacob conveniently walks in to see (kill) the new baby. But when he sees her, the most bullshit, anti-male plot device I have ever seen in my life comes into play. It's called ""imprinting"", and I'm not kidding about this, as soon as Jacob saw the vampire baby, he is doomed to a life of beta orbiting around her.

Hamster goes into lightspeed in Bella's mind, as she tries to rationalize Jacob, her alpha person, raising a child from birth, just so he can fuck her when she's 18. Holy shit, that is disturbing. It actually turns out at this point that there's a secret hamster in every vampire mind, because years back, a bunch of vampires turned babies into vampires, and it was disturbing shit that is pretty much the holocaust for vampires. The only difference between those babies and this one is that this one is half human, half vampire. 

The vampire government comes over, scared out of their minds because Bella just hamstered away a creature outlawed for causing ""mental scars in every vampire"". At this point, the vampire hybrid baby thing turns out not to be a vampire baby, sorry if this is confusing, but Bella's baby wasn't dangerous at all, even though it pretty much killed her by breaking her spine. 

Everything ends incredibly happily, with Edward morphed into a sexless beta who Bella relies on for emotional support, Jacob is a pedophile who Bella obviously still wants, Bella doesn't do jack shit whatsoever, Edward does everything for her, and Bella's baby overwhelms any sense of happiness for anything or anybody else. 

This is truly a case study of what women want, and how they get their man, and to quote somebody on here, ""turn lions into pussycats"". Feminists don't want you to read these books, because it's chock-full of warnings to men on how to avoid women who will ruin you. ",2014-05-12 10:23:35

Saw this on Facebook. This shit makes me furious. I wrote an addition and will look after iy being taught to my boy. 

""Enough reasons why moms can't, won't and will never be the right person to raise a man. 

In addition, a father's view:
2. Choose a girlfriend who doesn't externalize her responsibility for her love life or plays the victim in your relationship. That's emotional manipulation, the default, virtually undetectable female weapon. Find a woman who won't take something away from you that is your birthright: being a man. 

3. Pee how you must, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. Find a girlfriend who doesn't mind cleaning up your pee for no reason. Just like you bring her flowers 'for no reason'. 

5. We'll introduce your mom to: the power drill, the sawing machine, electrical circuits, phone chargers, tire changing skills, her muscles to open jars & carry the garbage & grocery bags etc. Then teach her how to USE THEM. 

6. Look around you, there is no god. Men AND women can be spiritual leaders. 

7. There will be times when you have to knock someone into respecting you or your boundaries. Never fear resorting to that, as.a.last.resort. This includes women who provoke you into using physical reactions. You can never hit a woman, but you can throw or hurl one (to defend your boundaries), if she deserves it. 

9. Choose a girl who: knows her rights AND knows her OBLIGATIONS; who knows, honors and respects men and doesn't bitch, ever. Why? Because bitching behavior never decreases. Totally ignore every woman who ever bitches. There actually are women who think all they have is equal rights, never equal RESPONSIBILITIES. 
9a. Watch out for women who hit the wall around 35, they're mostly looking for spermdonors. 

10. Take pride in your own taste of style, I'll guide you. After that, never take a woman's advice, women tend to want to dress you up and then whine about them having to look after a man who has no taste. 

11. Know when to be strong, and when to be tender. Never ever fear going against a woman's will or tears when you think you're right. There are women who actually think the world is supposed to accommodate every single feeling and emotion they have. Lmao. 

12. There are things very few women can do like: being goal or solution oriented, lift shit, manage their panic or feelings of entitlement, stabilize their emotions, think rationally all the time, ignore what other people think, hyperfocus, enjoy a stable and healthy self-esteem, teach a boy to become a man. There are women who think 'equality and mutual respect' means 'privileges - for women only'. 

14. A man is allowed to adjust or scratch his junk just like women are allowed to adjust or scratch their boobs. Pay no mind to women who tend to shame men over being men. Just ditch them. 

16. If she wants flowers, give her lots of flowers. But if she doesn't know how to return the male version of the chivalry or flower thing, dump her: she's useless and just wants to receive, receive, receive. A woman's general well being and love for you is her responsibility, never yours. 

17. It's good to be kind, it's better to be very clear, even rude, then kind when you're right. There are people who aren't capable of hearing the truth, smile and ignore them. 

19. Choose your spouse carefully, protect your family. If you need to go against your mom's will when you're a grown man, it's her bad luck. It was her responsibility to grow up herself WHILE she raised you. If she didn't, it's still her responsibility, never yours. 

20. If any of your parents is WORTH giving a call, do it. If they nag and give you a hard time, it's not your job to raise them. Remember: This does include your mother. 

21. Recognize the 'victim mentality' types who subtly emasculate men, they're bloodsuckers! Beware of women who want to change men into woman-servants. Avoid at all times. 
A man is an autonomous being. A good woman prefers her man like that, she doesn't need an 'assemble-your-ideal-man' package.""

>"" Most people have no idea how to fully contract their muscles via isolation exercises. Now if you go the Boston Loyd route and put 5cc horse syringes in your butt it doesn't matter. You can herp weights with no regard for muscular tension or form and still grow. If however you are natty, half natty, or YouTube natty, understanding how to properly contract your muscles is critical to your success.""


**Summary**: If standing in front of a mirror doing bicep curls/lat pull downs bores you to death, check out olympic weightlifting, aka the manliest sport on earth.


**Bodybuilding is good, but looks aren't everything**: If you're like me, you love lifting heavy shit once or twice, and then calling it a day (okay, sometimes I'll go HAM and rep out deadlifts, but it is very rare). GLO's advice of proper muscle contraction and the whole ""mind-muscle connection"" is, quite frankly, way too overblown in the fitness community, and contrary to what he says, is *not* critical to your success. Specific exercises contract specific muscles, and if you do those exercises enough, it will come to you  naturally. Now, good form is a must, but the real *critical* component to getting strong and jacked is to lift ***HEAVY***.

If you're a powerlifter, you can stop reading here and go back to reading about tinder sloots and affluenza-afflicted actresses on the main board.

If you're a newbie, or someone who's been doing bodybuilding with some emphasis on strength straining, please, carry on.

**DISCLAIMER**: Olympic weightlifting is arguably the most technically difficult sport on earth and having a good coach is very, very important.

***What is Olympic weightlifting?***: It's very simple. The entire sport consists of only 2 movements: 

[The snatch](https://youtu.be/0fM5R-pOcis?t=43)
and
[The clean and jerk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXqJN1PyD0E) aka the opposite of what you do before bed....
jerk and clean.....

Simple to watch, but performance....now that's a whole 'nother story. Athletes commonly spend 20+ years training in order to put up such unfathomable numbers. Day in day out grinding away at the barbell to add kilo after kilo to their total. Let me tell you something: 

There is nothing more masculine, more rewarding, more panty drenching, then putting 400+ lbs over your head. 

***Why you should do it***: 

**The mind**: Olympic lifting is brutal. It takes a massive toll on your body, as well as your mind. As someone who's played water polo and rugby, olympic lifting takes the cake when it comes to mental difficulty. Looking down at that bar loaded with fucking weight, thinking that you're about to drop under it...shit's intimidating. 
Of course, you're a fucking Red Pill man. You ain't gonna let some fucking weight scare you. You're gonna squat down, grab that shit, and catapult it overhead. And all that's going to do is benefit you. Olympic lifting teaches discipline, self control, it forces you to get the fuck over yourself when you feel broken. Bodybuilding does not do this. Powerlifting does it, but in a more boring way. If you want to become one with the iron and have the mental fortitude of a jacked and tan monk, do olympic lifting. 

**The body**: The key to massive hypertrophy and strength is picking up HEAVY shit and putting it back down. Not doing 20 reps of face pulls and super setting with chin ups. Those things will get you big in their respective sense, but nothing beats heavy compound lifts. (If you'd like to see a mix of both styles, check out George Leeman's youtube channel.) Olympic lifting is about the purest form of heavy compound lifting there is. The snatch and clean and jerk utilize your whole body (the least used muscle is the pecs). The primary movers are your legs, secondary being the core and shoulders. That's why olympic lifters look like

(the 2nd picture is dimitri klokov, and the last two are lu xiaojun. both athletes perform accessory exercises such as dips, strict presses, a little bench press, GHD, and some formal bodybuilding training. A vast majority of their training is still snatch, clean and jerk, and variations of those two movements.) 

Keep in mind you will have large quads. I personally think that's great, some may not. 

The interesting thing about olympic lifting is, it doesn't necessarily have to make you big. Pure strength training is very nervous system dependent, that's why you see guys who aren't big in the bodybuilding sense putting up huge numbers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLNzd_FcThs these athletes performed very heavy lifts (90%+ of their max) daily, for a couple reps. They did not experience much hypertrophy, but their strength went up. That first guy, Ivan Ivanov, is lifting 175kg while probably weighing around **55kg**. That's some perspective for you. How do you feel about a manlet putting your max deadlift overhead?

Anyway. Fortunately for us high volume olympic lifts are great for hypertrophy. 

[Here](http://imgur.com/opKbnLz&vvh1vMm) is what 1.5 years of high volume olympic lifting and a tad bit of bodybuilding (~2 months active bb) has done for me. Note: I'm fat, and I naturally have bitch tits, yet you can still see the definition around my shoulders, abs, and legs. Imagine me with a lower bf%, and you can envision what high volume olympic lifting can do for your physique. Your results may be slower than mine, as I started at 18, but if you want to make hypertrophy faster, just throw in more bodybuilding (this can inhibit your snatching and clean and jerking ability, which I will now address).

**Training Methodology**: Olympic weightlifting training is generally very pure. If you really want, all you can do is snatch, clean and jerk, and squat. Most athletes do a variation of these movements throughout the week, and then test their maxes once or twice a month. Throwing in a lot of bodybuilding exercises can be detrimental to your snatch and clean and jerk progress due to the technicality of the two lifts. You really have to spend lots and lots of time doing them to get them down. Time spent doing bodybuilding could be time spent getting better at snatching and clean and jerking. It took me over a year to get my snatch to look like something that's decently respectable.

As an example, here's what one of my workouts might look like: 

muscle snatch 1x5 @ 50kg, 1x5 @ 60kg, 2x5 @ 65 kg, 3x4 @ 70kg

power clean 1x3 @ 80kg, 1x3 @ 100kg, 3x3 @110kg

push press 1x5 @ 70kg, 1x5 @ 80kg, 1x4 @ 90kg, 5x3 @100kg

back squat (we usually alternate back squats and front squats every workout) 1x5 @ 70kg, 1x5 @ 100kg, 1x4 @120kg, 1x4 @130kg, 1x4 @140kg, 1x3 @150kg, 4x3 @160kg, and then maybe work up to a heavy single at 180+kg. 

Here is a large collection of example weightlifting programs: http://www.catalystathletics.com/olympic-weightlifting-workouts/training-programs/

I started out olympic lifting in a commercial gym. All I really did was cleans, I had no idea how to snatch, nor did I want to because I didn't really have the option of dropping the weight. The proper environment is necessary. You need bumper plates in order to make progress on your lifts, dropping steel from overhead is a huge no-no. 

The biggest factor in making progress and staying injury free is having a good coach. In the US, coaching can be rather expensive. Look around, see what you can find, if you're a student, chances are you can get some kind of discount. Many weightlifting clubs have group workouts, where you can get feedback on your lifts while working out with a team (a great camaraderie forming activity). Seriously, these lifts are extremely technical, and you don't want to end up as some crossfit fag who does shit like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIw8sFREePw 

With that said, there is plenty of good youtube content which can help teach you the movements. [Heres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2bcJFvW8nY) a good example. Be proactive, go check out a few weightlifting gyms if you're fortunate enough to have some in your area. Crossfit centers might also have dedicated weightlifting programs, but I'd stay away from doing crossfit itself if you want to be big and strong. 

Seriously, I have played over 10 sports and dabbled in bodybuilding and powerlifting and can say without a doubt olympic weightlifting is the most rewarding, exciting and masculine sport I have ever participated in. Don't let your age stop you from trying it out! [Vasily Alekseyev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Alekseyev)  clean and jerked 256kg at 35 years old. 

Of course, as in any strength sport, steroids are a huge part of the lives of the elites. But that's a topic for another day. You absolutely do not have to take steroids to be a good weightlifter. 

If you love moving fast, putting heavy shit overhead, getting big, being the strongest person the in room, and getting back up when you're beat down (like any red pill man should) then I seriously recommend you give olympic weightlifting a try. Bodybuilding is great, but there's so much more to strength and lifting weights than dumbbell curls and cable fly's. Maybe one day you'll get to stand on the podium in front of thousands and bask in the glory that is [weightlifting](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eXsBvTSa7IQ/maxresdefault.jpg).

I'm going to argue something roughly analogous, for only for the office. If you work in an office, you work with women, and you have an HR department. Read in context appropriately. 


I have a shelf dedicated to third wave feminism. I especially like third-wave feminism and intersectionalism. Butler, Sedgwick, and Foucault are prominent. Trans-inclusive feminism writings, and musings about the problematic nature of Michfest's exclusionary policies. I've taken college level classes in gender studies, which I'm happy to talk about. Oh, and of course I work to make sure our office has annual guest speakers on racial inequality, LGBT rights in the workplace, and how to address the paygap between men and women practically in the workplace. 


Why? 


Think as you like but behave like others.  


Some of you are holding onto romantic notions that you can effect change. That the wheels haven't fully come off the cart. That we're not in some state of decline. No, no, and no. When you watch documentaries on climate change and the ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere you'll hear some of the smartest minds in science say that we're already past a tipping point, that when the warming affects are manifest decades from now, even if we stopped all CO2 emissions today, that Earth is going to become warm enough that enough species will perish that the few extant species won't be sustainable. That either we'll be living in some ecological hell with quality of life that wanes to today's standard, or that we'll succumb to the extinction event ourselves. You may believe that, or you may not. I don't know that I care. The analogy can be made to feminism; we're past the tipping point. Even if all the virulent tumblr-esque rhetoric were to cease, all the gender studies programs to suddenly be exposed for the farces they are, it'd be too late. We're already formative years into this next generation deeply indoctrinated by our feminized culture afraid of and persecuting boys for existing as some necessary evil. These children will become adults, and their formative years have already been spent in public schools with single mothers. A decade from now it'll still be more toxic than it is now, no matter what you do in the interim. 


And even if you don't believe that, it doesn't matter. TRP is about accepting what is. Men's Rights, or any other advocacy organization, is about creating change. We're not changing anything but ourselves. We're accepting the world for what it is and acting accordingly. Your job isn't reversing the denigration of society, it's carving out your own little Eden insulated from the social justice equivalent of ecological demise. 


So make yourself immune from criticism from social justice or complaint from the left more generally. Purporting to believe as others do, and espousing their views even more aggressively than they do, is the key to my workplace success. If anyone hears something they don't like, I attack them from the left. Don't like that my division is making inroads on your clients? It's probably because we have a culture of diversity, I can't believe how many members of your management team are white women; why aren't you hiring more diverse candidates? Think that I'm being overly aggressive? It's probably because I'm so passionate about demolishing existing power structures and creating an office-wide meritocracy where we credit our success to inclusion and pay it back by organizing division-wide volunteering events at women's organizations. 


Oh, and talk like them, and use their words. 


Three women six months ago were upset with me. They called one of my programs idiotic. I emailed them a link on problematic ableist language and gave a heads up to HR. HR loves me. 


Am I speeding the demise? Probably. I'm the equivalent of China in my office, I'm putting up a new coal power plant every week. I don't care. Everything's coming up roses. Not only do I have more authority, making more money, I have an ace in my pocket above reproach, and it's called feminism. 


In the office, be a feminist.",2015-04-08 22:54:21

[Serious],5,0,5,2tqzv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2tqzv2/what_are_women_good_for_serious/,107,1422328215.0,"Let me preface this by saying it's not justification for hating or mistreating women, I'm not trying to be edgy I just want a decent discussion.



If we look at the statistics, single mothers are worse parents than single fathers. Women practice more favoritism with their children, spank more often and at younger ages, make poorer economic decisions and a whole host of other issues. I've heard that women are supposed to be the more caring of the two sexes, but the single most important factor for predicting the development of empathy in a child is a FATHER in the home, not a mother. 


Women are more likely to divorce for money, sleep around more often, feel less remorse, and prop up a bunch of the dumb feminist movements. After women were given the right to vote, the government tilted heavily to social programs and left leaning doctrines, almost single handedly creating the dependency/handout system and putting the country in debt.


So my question is, beyond breeding, what exactly is a woman specialized for? Seems to me like they raise children poorly, are worse providers and are unable to interact on a societal level with genuine empathy (just push the 'gimme dem state bux' line). What's the deal?",2015-01-27 03:10:15

It seemed like she was the type of girl who wouldn't mind being on film talking about how the pickup went down so I invited her out again, asked her if she would do an interview because I was making short films about attraction, fucked her again, and interviewed her right after we had sex. 

She admits (after prodding) that she was prowling bars looking for 'something, she didn't know what' ha. 

And she absolutely loved dominant, rough sex. 

The sex was particularly rough, full of energy, and we couldn't get enough of it. 

After this episode, I really am convinced that every woman just wants to be dominated completely. This girl was so happy to be seduced so fast and fucked so silly and it shows in her glowing face during the interview. 

Stay dominant men, its what they want.

The question of the day was ""What could you do for 24 hours without getting bored"". 

**A few responses from the women(most of who are washed up 30+ and have an unhealthy BMI)**:

-""...uhh probably eat food....or shop""

-""i would pet a dog. Yeah dogs"". 

-""Watch a korean show, or binge watch on music""

Any of my red pill brothers currently on this app right now? You'll see how boring and loserish these girls are. Me and the other hand, have gotten more matches simply from shining my personality through these videos. My responses:

Question 1- What's the most expensive thing you've broken?
""Breaking girls hearts! Just kidding, my knee, I need surgery for basketball""

Question 2- What's the best unconventional date you've ever been on?
""Best date ever? Hmmm...NONE cause i don't go on dates! BUH DUM TSS!""

Todays question-  What could you do for 24 hours without getting bored?
""This right here....(petting my cat)...I like to play with the pussy cat(grinning at the camera)""

**Nothing new here fellas, being on coffee meets bagel just reminds me most of these broads are dumb and  uninteresting as hell(not to mention whales).** They lack a personality and further reinforces how important charisma  is important both short term and long term dating.

First I want to say, I'm not trying to evangelize or impose my religion on anyone. I just want to share a testimonial.

I used to be a pretty hardcore atheist. I studied engineering and was a ""science is my religion"" kind of guy, rejecting all kind of religious/metaphysic thoughts and theories.

My parents are Catholics although I'm not sure they believe in it, and we never discussed the topic of God (I'm European by the way).

Then some years ago, the more I was understanding the world around me, the more I understood the the importance of concepts such as Truth, Beauty, Good. I started reading philosophers (the Stoics really had a big impact on me, especially Seneca), and I gradually got interested in what the Christ message was. I started reading the Gospels, and for the first time all this ""religious bullshit"" actually made a lot of sense to me.

In parallel I started swallowing the different red pill(s), and it totally confirmed by belief in Christianity.

The way I see it, we've been totally robbed of everything that makes a society strong: our religion, our nation, our value of family, our respect of elders, our balance of male/female roles. We're totally naked and without any substance anymore.

We all understand on this sub that men need to get back something that has been lost, we're not too sure what it is precisely but it's something. To me, the missing piece is spiritual and it's been in front of my eyes the whole time.

And wether Christ is the truth or not, there's nothing more powerful than a bunch of men united by a common religious faith - for better or worst. If you want to break your enemy, destroy his religion and the rest will follow.

Any way, I'm in the process of getting baptized. That's something I never thought would be possible, and yet here I am. I'm wondering if anyone is following a similar path.",2015-04-02 20:17:34
92,"The ""girls are dumb"" neg",42,0,42,3ixb2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3ixb2d/the_girls_are_dumb_neg/,60,1440938255.0,"I've seen a few guys complaining about a lack of game posts.  Here's a game post.

For two years I've been trying out some variation of the ""girls are dumb"" neg. I've recently had some success with a modified version of this.

Last year I tried this out on a plate, massage therapist plate, when I just up and told her she was dumb. This was not the most successful use of the ""girls are dumb"" neg but it lead me to yesterday's successful deployment.  So here's this story.

Last year my massage therapist plate and I were hanging out and drinking and she was trying to use me as her fucking beta cry pillow boy over some other alpha who pumped and dumped her. She's all sad, so I ask her what's up?  She tells me some vague story about some ""guy"", who was not one of her regular stable of beta orbiters, who she waited for outside of his work for three hours.  And he stood her up.

She dropped a tell by telling me that he's ""troubled"" and his ex is a ""real bitch"", to let me know that she wants his dick. And that she was all dressed up uncomfortable and waited in the hot sun, in her car, for three hours for this guy.  He went out with a different girl and he didn't even text her.  She's all mad and sad, telling me how upset she is because she texted him five times.

At this point this fucking plate was seriously testing my frame. Massive shit test telling me about her other alpha fucks.  I did not agree to spend time with this plate so that she could sob about getting pumped and dumped to me. That's her betas job.  And this bitch came over in pajamas wanting to fucking watch Pretty Little Liars with me. And she brought snacks.

So I just went nuclear on her. I told her that girls are often much dumber then they think. Because guys will always tell them how smart they are to get into their panties. And I reminded her that she failed the state massage therapist exam four times and I've got a degree from a fancy liberal brainwashing center.  And I straight told her that she's dumb and she needs to listen to me do what I tell her to do.  I told her she was going to end up being one of those sluts that gets an abortion.

I was using amused mastery and established high levels of pre selection and abusing the ""you're like my little sister"" game to go nuclear and straight tell her that she's stupid and needs to be led by a man like me.

Then I derailed that into her talking about how she's on birth control and I made sure she knew I had condoms.  When I fucked her she was quite submissive. But that was the night she told me ""I love you"" after sex.  And guys one thing I've learned is that once they drop the L-bomb on you their spinning orbit is going to expand until they spin into another man's pull.  Spin away plate.

Yesterday I went out with a potential mini-LTR.  Maybe even more.  I'm sick of soft harems so I'm looking for a girl I can spend maybe five years with. Maybe even more. Girl is 19 and prime and (likely) has not gone carouselling yet.  She still lives with her dad and hasn't started her college ride.  Been nineteen for two months.  We were texting.

I've been dropping pre selection into our conversations by occasionally mentioning my ""ex girlfriends"".  Any plate can become an ""ex"" in any conversation where it's useful to you. Especially if there are old pictures of you two together out on Facebook or something.

And I've already let this potential know that my last ex had bigger tits and a better ass then Starbuck's did.

She gets this;

""Well the last girl I was dating, *massage therapist*, was kind of stupid. I mean that's not some kind of moral judgement on my part. It's just that it was true. She had lots of other good things about her. She was very nice. And fun to hang out with. And she was a massage therapist and gave me free massages. Which are awesome by the way.  Plus her hair was long and she was cute.""

'Why did you think she was dumb?  Oy my dad always told me that guys will tell me anything to get into my pants.  (My pet parrot) just scared my dad. He's such a chicken!  :) :)'

""I mean she was just kind of dumb. One day I told her that she needed to stop making decisions without talking to me.  I forget how I worded it but I don't think I was mean. Maybe I was. I just let her know that she's not really very smart, but that's ok, and I liked her anyway.  And that there are lots of other good things about her.""

And I sent a second text before she could respond.

""I figured it would be good for her to know that she's not very smart because she always thought she was just so smart. And because of this she kept making bad decisions. Especially with money.

But her mom was always bailing her out.  And she was always going to her mom and having her mom buy us stuff. Even concert tickets once.""

And again I texted her before she could respond.

""She got so mad. I thought it was kind of funny but she was actually mad!  And she told me about all these other people, guys clearly, who had told her all about how smart (and funny) she was and is. I had to tell her that guys will lie to you if you are a girl and tell you all kinds of lies. To get into your panties.""

I don't typically send multiple messages so this broke our normal pattern of texts. She responded like so;

""Hey sometimes being dumb but really pretty gets you places lol. I personally hate that way. I am quite the opposite. I mean not because I'm not thin just I have bad genetics. With my large nose, big green eyes, and medium length black hair, with freckles.  Did you know I'm naturally a red head?  REAL red.  I'm a ginger. That's horrible! Some girls are real sluts, and some guys want nothing but a girls pants, which gets me really really angry.""

Conversation went fine with Starbucks.  And today I get this.  Have not texted her since last night and I now leave it to her to engage the chase, much to her delight.  She sends this;

""My favorite book is Fahrenheit 451.  I got an A on my AP English exam that I wrote on that very book.  My old English teacher Mrs. Snow even asked what I thought about that book.  So I really analyzed it. What's your favorite book *kill_your_ego*?""

So now she knows that she's got smaller tits then my pre-selection can pull, that I'll call a girl dumb to her face even with them tits.  Pics of us together on Facebook with massage therapist's tits out is +50 pre-selection bonus. And I'm sure this girl has looked.  And now she wants to qualify herself to me as not a dumb slut.

This girl is hard Christian so at some point in the future I'm going to bring up this old thread I've found (saved) on a Christian forum about what constitutes sex.  The consensus is that her sucking my dick isn't sex.  And it's iffy for her to let me go up her butt. But we can argue about it and hey why not try it out?

Gonna introduce that with more pre-selection.  I've established my n-number as 5 with Starbucks. By using hamster math and only counting my LTRs.  I think my 20+ number would make her think I'm a player or one of those evil PUAs or something.

But I can feed her hamster with *is this guy a player?*, and, *can my pussy lock him down?*, by so sincerely and honestly trying to figure out if my actual n-number is 5.  Cause it doesn't count when a girl sucks my dick right Starbucks?

What do you think girl?  Is it sex if she swallows my cum?

I pulled away from the group and was going to go home, as I'd rather be alone than with shitty company, but a good friend of mine showed up and reminded me what good company is.

We left the bar and headed into town. We danced like fools at a dope club.

While dancing, a sexy brunette approached me and told me how much she loves my long hair. Not a few seconds later, her jealous friend came over and pulled her away. She stared at me as she left.

We hopped to a few other bars but I got bored, so we started walking home.

As we pass the last of the bars on the street, I see a cute brunette looking at me from her table. We lock eyes, I smile, and I keep walking.

She says something to me in Romanian. I stop and turn back to her. 

""Sorry, what? I don't speak Romanian.""

She smiles and says to me, ""I love your hair"" and reaches out. I step to her and let her feel my hair. I meet her and her cute blonde friend who ends up being her cousin. My buddy comes over and meets them.

After a few minutes of talking he moves to the table next to us and stays on his phone to avoid any awkward moments with the cousin who isn't into him. Amazing wingman. 

She's sitting on the chair while I'm crouched next to her, but my knees star to hurt. I tell her to stand up. She does, I take her seat, and then pull her onto my lap.

""Good girl. Sit in papi's lap.""

She smiles and asks me if I'm her papi. I tell her yes. I bring up sex and she tells me she's a virgin. I tell her that I'm going to be the one to take her virginity. She begs to differ.

She's 19 and been going out since she was 16. Given the empirical evidence (I have more evidence than her), these girls seem to be a bit more conservative than their Western counterparts, on average. 

I ask her why she's never had sex and she tells me she's never found anyone who was worth giving it to.

I tell her again that I'm going to be her first. She teases me again.I grab her face and kiss her. Her cousin is smiling. 

I push VERY hard to bring her home, but to no avail. Perhaps twenty or thirty minutes pass and I decide it's not going anywhere. She doesn't want to get pulled in front of her cousin.

I grab her number and text her.

Me - just look as beautiful as you can

me - papi takes care of everything tonight

Her - Ok then. I'll come over in pajamas and with no makeup. Is that beautiful enough? (Kissy face)

Me - lololol

Me - (I send some pic of a chick in lingerie)

Me - If thats what you mean by pajamas, sure ;)

Her - (laughing emojis)

Her - Close enough

Her - (sends a pic of some bitch in unicorn pajamas)

__________________________________________

Silly bitch.

She comes over a few hours later. 

It takes me about 10 minutes to take her virginity. She even hands me the frame. She tells me how her cousin and her friends told her not to come over, and then when she was adamant, they told her not to do anything with me. I asked her if she's going to spend her whole life listening to what other people say she should do.

She gets quiet.

GG.

I take her clothes off and she asks me to be gentle, since she's new.

I am gentle....at first. I also confirm the virginity. Lots of blood. 

Our second round, I put this bitch's knees on her chest and piledrive her. It hurts her, but she enjoys it. She stares at my cock as it drives into her and I ask if she likes watching papi stretch her virgin pussy open. She tells me yes. 

I fuck her like four times. 

The next time I text her, I ask her to come over and she gives me shit about only wanting sex from her. I tell her that I like spending time with her. She continues to give me shit so I ignore her.

The next morning she texts me, ""Hi papi! :)""

Totally new attitude. We have a brief conversation, then I wait a day and text her ""hey baby.""

She comes over that night and we fuck again. This time, while hanging out, I tell her that her cousin is hot and that we should have a threesome. She gets mad.  

A few days later, she sends me a picture of her and her cousin licking ice cream. It's beyond suggestive. I give her some devil emojis and then ignore her next texts, because I felt like being an asshole for some reason. 

The next day, she sends me this

__________________________________________

Her - You really see just the slut in me, don't you?

Her - Well, I AM NOT YOUR FUCKING SLUT!

Her - So let's end whatever this is

__________________________________________

I try to calm her down but she keeps acting up.

Pimp hand ready.

__________________________________________

Me - Look, if you want to believe what you're thinking is true, then go ahead. It obviously doesn't matter what I say. I told you that I like you and enjoy spending time with you. I Also told you I can't promise anything more than that. I've been 100% honest from the start so I have nothing to justify and I don't have to defend myself. So if you don't want to see me anymore, then thats fine but don't accuse me or insinuate that I'm a bad person by giving me this attitude. I did nothing wrong.

___________________________________________

She apologizes and tells me that she thought she could handle a casual, sexual relationship but has feelings for me. I understand. I was her first.  

We end things on a high note.

A few months later, I randomly hit her up and she comes over that night. We fuck (and on one more occasion after that, before she leaves the country for an internship). 

She tells me how she still hasn't slept with anyone else. Maybe it's a lie. Maybe it's not.

Doesn't matter. 

I ask her why she hasn't fucked anyone else and she says all the other guys are boring. I ask her why she's with me then if she knows I won't date her (she's nice, cute, and fun to fuck, but I have other things in mind.)

She tells me it's still better than the other guys. ",2017-08-19 16:35:26

96,"""Sorry its a boy"" In an ad where Sarah Silverman delivers a baby to a family.",0,0,0,2utw64,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2utw64/sorry_its_a_boy_in_an_ad_where_sarah_silverman/,35,1423133763.0,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTQd0XYgo4E

Randomly saw this ad as I was on youtube. Sarah Silverman says ""Sorry its a boy,"" as she delivers a baby to a family. It's short, like 3 seconds but the implied message is clear. 

I do not think I need to discuss the implications of ads like these or the implied message of this specific ad to everyone on this board. I would be preaching to the choir.

What does terrify me is how it seems more and more everyday that the general consensus of our society is that anything masculine; even a male child being born, is labeled as negative.

Having a baby boy is negative.

Let me repeat that one more time: having a baby boy as a child is negative.

That's what this commercial says.
This is the voice of our culture being found in one of our most prominent mediums for information to the masses in westernized/american society. O brave new world.

I fear a future where men are to the world as the jews were to the nazis. I hope that does not happen.",2015-02-05 10:56:03

98,Go Your Own Way Elsewhere: Why TRP Isn't MGTOW and We're Not Monks,30,0,30,4t1dcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4t1dcx/go_your_own_way_elsewhere_why_trp_isnt_mgtow_and/,155,1468645815.0,"**EDIT:** /u/Archwinger summed it up better than I did: *""So I can see how the MGTOW weirdos might get confused and think that The Red Pill is primarily some kind of man-improvement ideology that's separate from getting laid. But really, it's about getting laid. If you're not here to learn more effective ways to get laid, you don't belong at The Red Pill.""*

**SUMMARY:** The Red Pill sub-reddit has grown by more than 60,000 members in the last year.  Unfortunately, *some of you still don’t get it,* and **seem to think we're some kind of edgy Men's Health 2.0**.  Bring on the downvotes.

Why does the Red Pill exist?  **TRP exists to create a forum for “discussion of sexual strategy in a culture increasingly lacking a positive identity for men.”**  That’s it.  That is the basis of this sub-reddit, the basis of our ideology, the source of our philosophies.  **Sexual.  Strategy.**

The pursuit of that overall sexual strategy offer many tactical options, all geared around the singular purpose of increasing SMV (sexual market value) in order to gain access to the higher quality sexual partners typically reserved for the top 10 percent of men, the natural “alphas.”  **Bodybuilding, nutrition, reading books, Monk Mode as a whole, these are all tools, tactics for to facilitate the process of increasing SMV.** 

* > TRP isn’t all about girls.

* > Pussy isn’t the objective.

* > The main goal should be improvement and acceptance of yourself.

* > Why are you so focused on sex?

**All three of the paraphrased statements,** part of a message I’m seeing more and more frequently on this sub, **represent a fundamental misunderstand of the objective of the Red Pill.**

**Monk Mode is not the end-game.**  We are not MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way).  We do not seek to remove ourselves from the Matrix and live in a dark, harsh desert of the real; we seek to to take manipulate it, take advantage of it, and in the process, do epic shit others cannot and live satisfying lives.  We don’t seek to end the hunt, to retreat like some kind of ascetic hermit to ponder existential enlightenment as voluntary incels.  Rather, we want to dominate the hunt and thrive in its process.

**TRP is the Art of War for men in the sexual marketplace.**  It encourages to know our “enemy” and to better understand her as well as ourselves so that when we meet, we will emerge from the confrontation victorious and successful on our own terms.  **But just as Sun Tzu was not a pacifist seeking to end all wars, we are not seeking to “change” women or alter the rules of the game.**  We leave that fool’s errand to MRAs and others of the like.  Ultimately, we just want to capitalize on all that slutty pussy they’re leaving on the table.

What about **outcome independence** and **IDGAF?**  Aren’t you not supposed to put the pussy on the pedestal?  Absolutely, and this is where MGTOW loses the fucking plot.  There is a strong distinction between becoming obsessed with a single woman (“one-itis”), not realizing that she’s exactly like the billions of others on the planet, and deciding to forsake the pursuit of women all together.  

**Outcome independence is internalizing your value, and knowing when to simply say, “Next,” and move on to another woman, not giving a fuck about the opportunity loss inherent to that decision (destroying the Myth of the Unicorn).**  But inherent in that process is *going on to the next woman, always gaming, pursuing, closing.*  IDGAF is about being willing to walk away, because the person willing to leave holds the power, and power, as TRP teaches us, is an effective aphrodisiac.  

By all means, minimize low-value activities like Netflix and addictive video games.  Continue your real education by reading quality books, expanding your base of knowledge and intellect.  Develop interesting hobbies and strive for professional achievements.  Lift heavy shit and achieve a healthy body fat percentage.  Live minimally because it allows you to focus on what’s important.  Find solace in the process because it is hard, but do not miss the forest for the trees: Becoming the best version of yourself is valuable struggle that builds strong character and social proof, and by-product of social proof is sex.

“How is that any different from PUA or seduction then?” you might ask.  The difference is PUAs rely on playbooks, gimmicks, and general bullshit to try and convince women to sleep with them.  We want to you build yourself into the man that women naturally want to fuck, to transcend that PUA shit by dominating your social environment.

But make no mistake: **The objective of TRP is to give men the tools for successful sexual conquest.**  Statements like, *”I truly believe that The Red Pill isn't only about the girls,”* just indicate you don’t understand why we’re here.  You may choose to voluntarily forego the dating game, to pursue some kind of solitary enlightenment.  But that choice is yours, and yours alone.  **That does not make it TRP, and it does not change the fact that TRP is built around the principle of fucking beautiful women.**

**CONCLUSION:** 

* You are free to establish your own priorities in life, but that doesn’t make them TRP’s.

* Stop trying to reinterpret TRP and conform it to your belief system; take that shit elsewhere.

* Crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.
