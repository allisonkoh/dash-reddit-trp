0,RPW Wednesdays - Episode 5: The Wall,14,0,14,ftbzj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ftbzj3/rpw_wednesdays_episode_5_the_wall/,7,1585815418.0,"https://youtu.be/Qu0F_jW7quE

Tonight's discussion takes on The Wall and how it applies to women's pluralistic mating strategy. This episode was shaped towards women, but the research articles below are worth reading and the video is evergreen for the entire Red Pill community.

Not only do they discuss The Wall and how women can navigate it, but for those with kids they give useful tips and pitfalls to consider with raising your daughters as they enter the Sexual Marketplace. 

Key questions that were raised...

* Were our elders on to something by restricting daughters' sexuality when they come of age by screening boys they can intersect with? 
* What role do parents and grandparents play in this process?
* What pitfalls does social media create? 
* How can women navigate the sexual marketplace while avoiding getting alpha widowed or being paralyzed by choice due to the advent of dating apps like Tinder?

**The Wall:** The hallmarks of fertility are largely responsible for what make makes women physically attractive to men. To wit, looks and fertility are effectively one in the same. The further women move away from their peak fertility years (late teens to early 20s) the less physically attractive women become. Mother Nature is not a feminist. 

**Strategic Pluralism:** Women's mating strategy has often been referred to as a dualistic strategy (AF vs BB), but it's more nuanced than that. As discussed in the livestream, there's the AF/BB during women's monthly cycle and then there's a macro level application of this across their lives opting for AF during their youth and then settling for BB once they approach the dreaded wall. Ideally women should strive for guys that have a good blend of both dad *and* cad qualities. The best of both worlds if you will. Guys that get this figured out have options galore as they're the total package, so our advice to the ladies is to not delay if you know early on you want to have a family someday.

1,Post Quality,32,0,32,fucqlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fucqlt/post_quality/,6,1585964304.0,"This is a repost, but it would appear we have some new posters that need some guidance.  I am giving an amnesty to any post that has been posted to date, unless it is an egregious rules violation or a site wide violation.  I cannot promise automod or another mod might yank it.

Also be sure to [visit this note](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/f9cm7n/reddit_admin_are_hellbent_on_killing_off_reddit/) from our chief mod and operator of http://trp.red/
----------------------------

A few weeks ago I posted about the quality of submissions and the sort of things I would summarily remove without comment.  It would appear the message was not received.  So I‚Äôm going to try again but with additional detail and perhaps a bit more menacing.  

Before continuing, you should read [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ery372/dear_diary/) if you haven‚Äôt already.

##Priorities

**A guiding principle of this sub has always been QUALITY over quantity.**

We don‚Äôt need to shit-spew dozens and dozens of posts a day like so many other shitholes on reddit.  You can participate by providing good content.  In return the rest of us give the same to you.  Since there are more of us that you, you should be spending more time listening than talking.

**ECs and founding members are important to us.**

We want them to stick around or at least stop by from time to time.  We value what they have to say.  We value their critiques.  We value their experience.  We do not value your personal life story.  We do not value your justice porn.  We do not value your need TO [SAY SOMETHING](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3d5u6t/first_post_syndrome/).

You should be listen to the ECs and refrain from doing things that would drive them away.  Disagreement is ok, but do so in a mature, professional manner.  Refine your ideas before presenting them.  Simply negating an EC looks like dick waving, not proper discourse.  

##The rules and guidelines

**The rules are not optional.**. READ THEM: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/about/rules/  

These supplement site wide rules.  READ THOSE TOO: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy

NO VIOLENCE.  Period.  Zero tolerance.  This is a site wide rule that I completely agree with.  Don‚Äôt even joke about it.

This rule and ‚ÄúThreatens, harasses, or bullies‚Äù are the hammers that the reddit admins use to nuke subs.  The difficulty for them has been that we have always banned this sort of behavior.  There will be no brigading.  We do not spill out into any other subs unless explicitly invited.  We keep what we do in our subs and leave everyone else the hell alone about it.  

I have and will work with mods in other subs to root out people that violate this so we can ban them.

**Do not name anyone that is not a public figure.  Do not post pictures of anyone that is not a public figure.**  We don‚Äôt care what your girlfriend looks like.  We don‚Äôt care about some random bar slag you want us to point and laugh at.  

**Breaking any rule is a bannable offense.**  Not knowing a rule is also a bannable offense.  Deleting your bannable post or comment and then asking us why you were banned is going to get you permanently banned.
  
##Post quality

Obviously this does not strictly apply to comments, but we ask you to at least TRY to say something of value.  One word responses and short zingers just clutter shit up.  Do the latter only if you think it really adds to the point.

**There are post formatting rules.**

Yes, really.  Read them here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3a0135/announcement_new_thread_requirements/. I‚Äôm going to start enforcing them again, but not super strictly.  Sometimes a different format works better.  Ask yourself: is your writing so good that your format makes it better?  In most cases, the answer will be NO and I will remove it.

We do allow direct links into manosphere.  We allow links elsewhere IF ACCOMPANIED BY A COMMENT THAT PROVIDES ANALYSIS OF THE LINK.  Don‚Äôt be lazy.  A 50 word TL;RD is not analysis.  Tell us what you think about it and what it teaches, not just what it says.

**There are content guidelines and principles.**

Read them here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3d4qb2/on_platitudes_imperatives_and_unsolicited_advice/. https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1u6m3m/the_basics_explained_and_our_direction_for_2014/. https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2xwllf/100000/

If you haven‚Äôt read all of this, don‚Äôt post.  You aren‚Äôt ready.

##Post removal 

I‚Äôll try to be more explicit than last time.  This is the last time I give you lists.  From here on out it is your burden to figure out what is post worthy and what is not.  So here is the list of things that will get removed without comment:

- Pointing and laughing without a learnable point.  Making fun of other people is a waste of time.  Learning how to avoid their predicament is useful.
- Justice porn.  This isn‚Äôt a contest and there are no winners and losers.
- Seeking validation.  We are not your mommy.  If you need our opinion to feel better about yourself, you are not ready to post.  Validation seeking is a destructive and gross behavior.  Chicks most certainly hate it.  I hate it too.
- Black pill woe is me shit.  Your life sucks?  Keep it to yourself.
- Black pill woe is you shit.  My life sucks?  That‚Äôs my problem.
- Links to other subs that haven‚Äôt been scrubbed through an archive service.  A couple popular services are https://www.trp.red/archive.php and http://archive.is.
- Dear diary posts.  Basically you talking about yourself without giving a concrete, learnable point.   ‚ÄúHe guyzzz, it really works!‚Äù is not a learnable point.
- Autistic ramblings about your life.
- [This sort of shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/cc0vj2/about_cosmomasculinity/).  Does it sound like clickbait?  Is it formatted like clickbait?  Don‚Äôt do it.
- Debating or negating.  We don‚Äôt give a fuck if you disagree.  If you think you have a better way, then present it as a better way.
- Stuff that belongs on https://www.reddit.com/r/ThankTRP/

The following are danger areas.  There are lots of good posts that do it, but be mindful of the content guidelines and principles.  They are:

- Prescriptive advice.  Tell me a proper way to eat, drink, lift and general life skills can be useful, even if controversial.   Giving us a checklist of how to approach is not.  The former are material acts with specific results.  The latter is how something worked for you, which is worthless to the rest of us.  You‚Äôd be better off telling us Why it worked for you.
- Politics.  Der.
- Meta topics.  If you really think there is a hot topic, then ask us first. 
- MGTOW but because of what I will be saying about incels below.
- Short posts unless it‚Äôs a razor sharp and novel point.  Good posts usually take time. 

##Ban bait

Aside from violating the rules, the following might get you banned (technically they are rules violations, so consider these examples, rather than additions).  They are:

- Incel content.  I‚Äôm so fucking done with it.  No memes.  No egging each other on.  No trying to find your kin.  Zip.  If I sniff an incel, you are gone.  You better be an incel in active recovery.
- [Jordan Peterson](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9gyopm/no_more_jordan_peterson_shit/)
- [This sort of trash](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/emxugb/last_night_i_didnt_have_sex/).  Read the comments, chucklekfucks, if you want to find out what the post really means.  This one is temporarily suspended until Max does his follow up post.

**I‚Äôm serious about incel content‚Äî-it‚Äôs gone.**. The worst fucking thing reddit ever did was shut down braincels, because now the rest of us will suffer it.  We are now joining a large number of other subs that are shutting it down.  

As a clarification, I understand there is a difference between ‚Äúblack pill‚Äù and incel.  You can harbor dark opinions while not actually being an incel.  Your opinions will be judged on everything else in this post and not by a possible connection to incel content.  Connect the dots is a game simpleton‚Äôs play (aka a whole lot of other subs).

##Closing remarks

**There are no new rules in this post.**  This all flies under what was already acceptable or not acceptable.  

A lot of focus is being put into our other home:  http://trp.red.  If you are looking for more diverse topics, go there.  Find or found a tribe for it.  Here we are going to refine focus on our core principles and purpose, and expect quality in posts.

Feel free to ask questions in comments.  I‚Äôll do what I can as long as I don‚Äôt get overwhelmed.

Finally, I hereby grant a general amnesty for any post submitted before this one‚Äîas long as it doesn‚Äôt break site wide rules.  I also may leave some posts up but locked with a note why it should have been removed.  These are teaching moments; make use of them.",2020-04-04 01:38:24
2,Post-TRP LTR: a balancing act between masculine aggression and vulnerability,97,0,97,fuxcf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fuxcf4/posttrp_ltr_a_balancing_act_between_masculine/,20,1586049135.0,"**INTRO**

I discovered TRP five or six years ago now. At that point in my life, I was smart, egotistic, socially awkward, and not particularly (read: not at all) attractive. I'm sure we all have our own treasured memories from high school.  

Over the years I succeeded and failed in applying TRP. A few years back, I met the girl who would become my first LTR ever. TRP ideas helped me predict her behavior, but I also used them to mask my insecurities. Instead of writing a novella with all the boring details, I jump from idea to idea doing my best to avoid TRP cliches.

**BODY**

First things first, my self awareness when she and I met might have put me on the autism spectrum (she used to point out similarities between myself and her friend with aspergers). My looks compensated for it; **weight lifting** contributed to my looks more than any other factor. I cannot overstate how important weight lifting has been in my life the past half a decade or so.

Sex was always the most enjoyable when I treated it as a game. I learned to not go into the bedroom with a script in my head of how things were supposed to go; instead I went with the flow based on how she and I were feeling. Sometimes we fucked dirty, sometimes we made love, other times we just fucked around giggling like kids. Going with the flow always kept it natural; forcing it always felt rigid and unnatural. The only book I've read on the topic is The Sex God Method. I think it's a good place to start developing your own brand of sexuality. 

An LTR will change you. You'll likely become gentler, softer, and more pleasure seeking. Being on the other side now, I can see how my LTR changed me in those ways. It's inevitable, and it's something you should be aware of before shacking up. This change has pros and cons: I lost some of my aggression and ambition, but gained empathy and a certain *joie de vivre*. Now that my relationship is over, I've regained my natural aggression and retained the soft skills I developed with my girl. 

**CONCLUSION**

I'm grateful to have known the amazing girl I dated and for being TRP conscious going in. Before my relationship, I was decently attractive but very rough around the edges. IMO, LTRs are great for refining all aspects of seduction (wit, foreplay, etc.) and social agility. More than anything, I treasure the intimacy I shared with her and the connection we made. All in all, I'm very satisfied with how things turned out and what I learned from the experience.

**Edit**

I left out a lot of details to avoid beating dead horses. The rougher I treated her in bed, the better she treat me. When I fucked her weak she acted out. If I acted like a pussy, she treated me like a pussy. Et cetera, et cetera. You know the rest.",2020-04-05 01:12:15
3,Rapport Seeking Voice,289,0,289,fu8g4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fu8g4g/rapport_seeking_voice/,66,1585949388.0,"There are 3 types of vocal tonality: **Rapport Seeking**, **Rapport Neutral**, and **Rapport Breaking**.

**I want to talk about Rapport Seeking**:

This is the tone you often hear when people ask a stranger a question. ‚ÄúExcuse me, do you have the time?‚Äù It‚Äôs disarming. You want to make sure the stranger feels comfortable with you approaching them on the street, so you‚Äôre basically raising the pitch of your voice to subtly say ‚ÄúHey stranger, I am of no harm to you, please don‚Äôt be afraid as I approach.‚Äù

This is a safe and recommended tone for women to use. In fact, if you‚Äôre anything like me and were raised by a single mom, then *you probably don‚Äôt even realize that you replicate this tone in social situations*. 

**My mother spoke** to us children in her neutral voice, but the moment the phone rang, she would answer **with her rapport seeking tone**. The same would happen when she spoke to a stranger (the waiter, post office clerk, people at the bus stop, my teachers, etc.). Literally every person she encountered, my mother‚Äôs tone would raise and without realizing it, **I grew up doing the same thing**.

**This tone is crippling for a man.** You are conveying that you are lower status. People pick up on the cue and act accordingly. If you don‚Äôt believe me, the next time you are having a conversation with someone, male or female, take note of their tone as the conversation progresses. If you are speaking to them in a rapport seeking tone, they will change their tone in response. Your tone is saying, ‚ÄúI am lower status than you, please be kind to me, I am harmless.‚Äù They will change their tone to a more rapport breaking (Higher status) tone. This won‚Äôt even be a conscious shift. It just happens because people naturally pick up on social cues and nonverbal communications. 

Learning this was unbelievably eye-opening for me. I saw a YouTube video a few years ago about vocal tones (I'm aware the red pill covers this, but that isn't where I originally learned about tonality) and then I began noticing mine when I spoke. Awareness is the first step to change. Then it's time to take responsibility. **I could‚Äôve blamed my mother, but instead,** **I** **grabbed the wheel** and took responsibility for making the change. It was awkward at first because I had to literally correct myself mid-sentence, ‚ÄúHi!‚Äù (Rapport seeking tone) \*ahem\* ‚ÄúHey, how are you?‚Äù (Rapport Neutral)

The first female I tried this on was a cashier I saw multiple times a week. Usually, she didn‚Äôt even look up at me during our transaction. However, just simply changing my tone of voice to a Rapport Neutral (and eventually I mixed in some Rapport Breaking), she not only made eye contact with me the entire time, but her voice tone went from Rapport Breaking to Rapport Seeking towards me. Soon, she would greet me as I stood in line, and our small-talk was much more comfortable.

I began applying it to every conversation I had, no matter who I spoke to. Males that I used to feel were kind of dicks towards me either accepted me as their equal, or even flipped the script and began speaking to me in a rapport seeking tone. Even my female boss now speaks to me in a rapport seeking tone (That one was a surprising shift at first).

Check your tone of voice. If you‚Äôre seeking rapport from others, bring that pitch down to a neutral place (the tone you speak in when talking to your friends) and even learn when to mix in some rapport breaking tones to raise your status. You will be surprised at how much it changes your life.",2020-04-03 21:29:48

5,How to grow up elegantly?,1,0,1,fuywge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fuywge/how_to_grow_up_elegantly/,3,1586054511.0,"I know it's a basic and simple question, but it has been on my mind for quite a while.

This thought began just an hour ago when a friend left a comment on a certain Instagram post of mine. He's a good buddy, the man who first introduced me to the ways of TRP. His comment lacked gracefulness, and I wished not to interact in conversation with rudeness and unmannerly remarks. I left no reply.

The problem of modern men is not only about the self-defeating competition against himself in fucking women. The problem is also about how they talk without using their brain. Some people express rudeness without even the slightest consideration. Maybe it's a cultural thing, maybe not. Who cares, any socially intelligent man expresses his opinions with poise. In layman's terms, he is not viewed as trash by society.

I'm in my mid-20s and I'm starting to find my own lane, knowing who I really am. Gone was the guy who displays rakish behavior. Gone was the guy who objectifies women. There's a certain place for a man to act that way and that's when he is a boy. I want to be elegant and would act the part growing up.

TRP is a body of knowledge. Since it has originated from the persepective of insecurity and a lack of self-confidence, the ones that 'awaken' learn the truth behind why things are the way they are, but they fail to identify a deeper side of self-development and it is true acceptance of what is, while applying the truth and not altering himself to what he is not.

As Rollo once said, ""personality is not static."" Best to be yourself while applying what you know of the truth. People, and not just women, could intuitively smell from a mile away whether you are being true to yourself or you are just playing a character based on your imagination from the truth.

Confidence is acceptance of what you really are‚Äìyour strengths, your weaknesses, you are all of them. Embrace them and play them to your advantage.

Guys introduced to the facets of TRP turn to a more materialistic approach of application, while failing to regard to *age well* with it. Like fine wine, it takes years of intensive care to taste its best flavor. Only then can we say that the juice is well worth the squeeze.

Yesterday, some guy posted on this sub about his frustrations from living the TRP life. Despite his 'years of self-education' with the knowledge and truth, he has found no meaning from fucking around with countless women he encountered throughout his journey. TRP is not a cycle of fucking women over and over, nor is it a game of who gets more lays than who, but rather it is a means of getting to know more about the self and how it can be refined further growing up.

I'm turning 27 this year. Most of my buds still act like they are still in college, being reckless and disregarding the perception of what people think of them. Boys will be boys, so the saying goes. But also, boys turn into men and it starts from a shift in mindset.

Sure, priorities change as men grow up. They get married. Get frustrated by their wives. We all know this premise way too much. Of course, it's a shame if you don't realize that we are the ones who should recognize this narrative more than the other guys. The narrative has been the same ever since Eve ate the apple.

What's more important growing up is the *mindset*. At age 30-35, fucking women wouldn't be the main priority, heck it wouldn't even be an issue, because the mindset has changed. Counting the number of lays has its own place in the life of a TRP-ed man... but growing up elegantly is what drives value even further into the sexual market place--sometimes I cringe even mentioning these terms because they all seem to stem from technicality, that it seems so unnatural for a man in the perspective of a woman.

Sure, ok, not giving a fuck what people think is what other people would argue... but I have considered that I do give a fuck about what people think because everything boils down to how much people would like to associate with me. May it be in business, peers, or even as shallow as the women I attract.

I find that a handful of people in the TRP community values the knowledge behind the ideologies to its utmost potential. However, some guys fail to realize that women are not only sexual objects of desire, as a way to compensate for self-improvement and progress, but people also degrade themselves by doing this. And that is not very elegant.

I think elegance is the highest form of value (in all the market places in the economy of human relations) caused by a clean mindset, intention, and discipline.

Don't you guys agree?",2020-04-05 02:41:51
6,Female solipsism at its finest. Example,110,0,110,fu5aly,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fu5aly/female_solipsism_at_its_finest_example/,118,1585934885.0,"Edit: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Note flair if someone's confused

I really enjoyed the post about female solipsism, as it's something that can be vividly seen and tracked. So here is a recent story. 

So because of all this quarantine and lockdown, I've been getting texts from some of women that I used to try to spin or the ones I was actively trying to before the virus hit the fan. 

I'm not much of a texter, I suck at reading between the lines, therefore for me, it's a logistics tool. I use it strictly to share important information and set up dates. I don't use social media either. I used to, but it's a waste of time. So when I got the following text, I really didn't know not only what time think, but what to say.

9:40 PM : Please PLEASE do not tell anyone because I do not know how I ended up here I trust you.

I just did cocaine.

What? Okay first of all this chick is wild, this doesn't surprise me. Hot, extroverted, witty. She knows her game. She's hard to get. She normally doesn't share personal information or what she does, besides I don't text things like ""what are you up to"". I've been using the rule of less is more and slowly reeling her in. Her issue? Awful friends/influence/coworkers. Note: Apparently cocaine goes around but she ""would never do such a thing"". 

Here is where this is a great example of solipsism.

She is acting like it happened on its own. It just happened. She is not responsible. Which is utter bullshit. Social perception got her in this position and now it's hitting her that she fucked up and is a bad girl. She always was, she likes her alcohol and pot, and with cocaine being all around her it was bound to happen. But telling women what to do is useless. What they see is what it is, and she saw herself as capable, responsible, good. Wrong. She's nowhere near. 

I soft nexted. Seriously I have 2 dull plates waiting after quarantine, and it sucks cause this woman would not care about quarantine restrictions, but not looking for crazy. Especially when they follow up the texts with:

Idk why I shared with you, I'm sorry, I just need to tell someone, I'm in a bad stage in life, it will never happen again.

Why even apologize? If she never told me I could keep fucking her and not be bothered. But she cares what people prcieve her as. And that's all women care about.

TLDR

Plate texts me she did cocaine and it's not her fault and she isn't responsible. Right. You get the rest. The only reason women will tell you something like this is because they think you're some benevolent God who will forgive them and tell them everything is okay! She's not bad!

Edit:

I'm glad this brought up discussion, as thinking about something is a lot more productive than simply absorbing information.

Edit 2: 

So what I've learned is there are way to many coke heads on Reddit! Y'all need some serious medical attention my friends! COVID-19 does like a weak immune system :D",2020-04-03 17:28:05
7,How COVID-19 will break all your plates ... and more,380,0,380,ftmh9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ftmh9i/how_covid19_will_break_all_your_plates_and_more/,143,1585863512.0,"&#x200B;

Disclaimer: This is not a post about how to get girls, there are so many posts on that here in trp or the PUA community or whatever on what you should and should not do (even though it all comes down to how much you try and the experience you have in the end) this post is on how to maintain your plates, the reasons as to why we break them and what it looks like when you get laid consistently.

The problem with texting

I know that during this pandemic there are guys here who feel the need to text their plates or even new girls. Please for the love of god stop texting girls. Girls, you've hooked up with, girls you want to hook up with, it doesn't matter stop texting them. You can never break a plate by not texting her during this pandemic. But if your attention-seeking, validating, orbiting ass keeps texting her it's easy to fuck up. 

This doesn't just go for this pandemic, it's for everyday life as well.

A bad habit for me personally that I had to get rid of is thinking that if a girl isn't constantly texting me she'll never want to fuck again. This couldn't be further from the truth. The closer you get to her only wanting to text you when she wants to fuck, the better. SHE HAS FRIENDS FOR CONVERSATION, SHE HAS BETA ORBITERS FOR VALIDATION, she should only have you when she wants DICK. All of the women that I fuck consistently, or women that my buddies have, usually only text them Friday night, Saturday night, during the holidays, during their breaks from work or late at night, why? Because that's when they wanna fuck. Not at 1 pm on a Monday afternoon during their bi-monthly hair appointment.  I realize this because I've hooked up with girls and I would forget all about them, not text them at all, and a month later they'd hit me up at 2 am talking about ""wyd rn"". They hit me up, not the guy who they've been texting constantly for the past month, not the guy who commented on her Snapchat story, me, the hot guy who is the opposite of needy and doesn't really give a fuck about them. They're times where I've had to reject girls just because of how fucking late they would hit me up. 

Silence is what you should want, I mean fuck, I like it that way, it's peaceful. Just because you're phone isn't blowing up does not mean no girl wants to fuck with you, just calm down and only text when you wanna set up a plan to meet, or if she wants to text you. Don't try to get your snapchat popping or your phone going off by replies from women just because it feels good, you're fucking up, even if it is flirtatious the main thing is -  it is not necessary, and it makes it easier to fuck up.

Here is why you've already failed when you start texting for convo, the only reasons why you would have to in the first place is because: 

1. You didn't leave a good enough impression when you first met so you're tryna make up for it via text - which almost never works, and is so incredibly hard compared to being in-person that it's not worth pursuing. 
2. You're lonely and want the attention of a woman 
3. You haven't even met the girl - which I strongly advise against sliding into the dm's and being grouped with the hundreds (yes hundreds, doesn't matter if the girl is hot or not) of betas who've already tried.
4. You lack an ""abundance mentality""
5. You just want her to know you exist - (lol you pathetic piece of shit, but damn I've been there too)

What does it look like for guys who get laid consistently

Let me break down what getting laid consistently looks like, it's not a lot of effort, in fact, it's almost no effort when it happens, most of the effort comes at the beginning, once you have it though, it's easy to maintain. For starters, do as I said before and stop texting for convo. It's a Saturday night or whatever and you want to get laid, okay great! You've already texted that girl you met in class three days ago who you gamed to the point where she would be down to hang. Oh, you haven't? You haven't even met a new girl this week? Jesus. No worries, text that plate who you know would be down to hang because you know she likes you a lot. She hasn't responded? Text your other plate. She's going to the club with her friends? Text your other plate, wait, you don't have any other plates? You only have TWO girls on your phone who you've hooked up with recently? What the fuck?

Okay, not all hope is lost, you can go to the club with the other plate, or with your friends who like to go out, and you can either get with her there or find some other girl because damn, you're in desperate need for more women in your life. You may not pull today but maybe tomorrow, as you learn and grow from your mistakes. Maybe next week, it takes time, it takes rejection. But you'll get to the point where you have a solid amount of plates. 

As you get more plates and start texting girls only when you want to hang out, the more of a chance you have for a girl to hit you up when she's free, and the more likely you are to find a girl who would be down to hang out. Don't get lazy and try to be fuck buddies instantly with the girl you just met by texting her a lot, it's not how this works. And even if you become successful with fucking this one girl a lot, what happens when she flakes, or when she isn't free? You're jacking it. Texting doesn't get you anywhere. But it all starts with you going out and trying to pull, and doing it consistently.

""Oh great, so basically in order to get laid consistently you have to be getting laid consistently, great fucking advice man"". Thank you, and it fucking is! You can't be getting laid consistently without looking like a man who gets laid consistently, you've read trp you know how this shit works. What do you need to maintain your perceived attractiveness from a girl? 

1. Outcome Independence 
2. Abundance Mentality 
3. IDGAF attitude

These are all traits of men who get laid a lot, and women think they should fuck. You have to fake this first. Me and you both are not the type of men to get laid a lot, we're not that hot, we don't have that cool of a  job according to society or fame or that much money. But the guys who do, and the guys who girls want, all have these attributes. The good thing is, girls feel this instinctually, so if you can fake out their instincts at first by acting like a guy who does get laid a lot, well, you get the picture. The moment a girl believes you do not have these qualities, your attractiveness diminishes. Again, to get a girl is easy enough, just go on trp and search it up and emulate what they tell you, you'll hear about shit tests, escalation, push-pull yaddi yadda, but what you need in order to keep getting laid by the same girl are those three things. Simply put, texing a specific girl for long periods of time about a subject that doesn't fucking matter diminishes these qualities because it becomes obvious you're texting her because 1, you care what she thinks and what she says, 2, you don't have anything better to do or anyone else to text. Now look at those three attributes, does acting like that align with it? No. 

So you realize you shouldn't be texting and you need more plates so you shoot your shot at several women consistently every other day. And you remembered to follow up on your kills for some other day you can hang out. Now you always have a girl you can hit up. After a while, you get to a point where there's no point in texting all of these women anyways because who has the energy to keep up with text conversations with 10+ women. Once this happens to you guess what, you become less needy, you don't care what happens when you don't text this girl, or if you say this or that to her, you ACTUALLY become outcome independent, you don't have to fake it because you ACTUALLY always have another girl you can fall back to. Women pick up on your abundance mentality and your idgaf attitude which helps maintain your attractiveness. You're experienced now you know how to handle interactions with girls so you ooze confidence, also maintaining your attractiveness. You can fucking RELAX and not text now because, with all these women on your phone who you've met with and hooked up with consistently when Saturday night comes now there's bound to be a message waiting for you, a girl invites you to her house at 12 pm to fuck, or better yet, dinner. And look at that, you didn't even have to ask her how her day was. 

Don't let your thirstiness take over this pandemic, it'll just make things worse, #stoptextingplates2020",2020-04-02 21:38:32
8,Are you stroking your ego?,0,0,0,fugmsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fugmsf/are_you_stroking_your_ego/,12,1585977209.0,"Edit: This post mainly goes out to the ones who frequent askTRP.

I'd advise reading my previous post 'Perception' before reading this.


First and foremost. TRP is full of men who want to cling on to their own perception in order to stroke their own ego. These men are saying to themselves that they're an alpha,¬†why? It gives them a boost to their own ego. It feels good. You may be one of these men reading this and thinking that you don't stroke your own ego, in order to STROKE YOUR OWN EGO. Well, do you want to find out if you do or not?¬†




Ask yourself these questions:




- Do you repetitively¬†delete your posts/comments on here and askTRP?¬†



- Do you try to justify your actions to others?



- Can you not accept being wrong?



- Do you insult others?



- Do you post and feel worried about what other members of TRP are going to say?



- Do you live your life¬†by what other people say here by¬†a dime?



- Do you suffer with severe cognitive dissonance about the theory of TRP?



- Do you care so much about being 'alpha'?




If you say yes to any of these. YOU'RE STROKING YOUR OWN EGO. 




Many will cling on to their perception no matter what, why? Because they're afraid of being wrong, and therefore afraid of being emotionally hurt. That's EGO. 



Few will challenge their own perception. To be fair, everyone who actively participates in TRP has challenged their own perception. But there's another hurdle, breaking free from the ""I'm so alpha"" bullshit here, ESPECIALLY in askTRP.



You need to make your own rules. At the moment, you are following rules of others who are stroking their own ego too, just like you. You are the blind being lead by the blind.



Now, it's important to remember that not ALL people in TRP are blind. Notable examples would be the mods and EC's.



Now, it's perfectly OK if you're one of these men who are blind, because it's your current perception. Your perception in the future is going to be different from now, but only if you are able to challenge your own perception, and other people's perceptions. This post is ME challenging your perception. It is vital for a person to be able to do this, as this is how they move on.



Side note: Your perception is another name for your frame.



You can control other people's perception to a certain extent, by perceiving yourself as this and that, which is fine.¬†But you shouldn't care about their perception of you. This is what¬†outcome independence TRULY means.



If you're worried about other people's perception of you. That means you're not being true to yourself. You're not making your own rules. You're living by other people's rules.




On to my next point:



TRP IS JUST A TOOLBOX. STOP WORSHIPPING A FUCKING TOOLBOX.


You decide what you do with the toolbox.


> What you create is up to you.


Credit to The1ndex for that quote.



People here say this for a reason, you know?




Another point:



The EC's on here are not gods, or super-ultra-mega-fucking Chads. Sure, they might have a lot of 'Chad' traits. But they also have 'beta' traits. They are human beings, just like you and me.



Speaking of EC's, I messaged Heathcliff the other day, and he¬†explained to me that being stuck in the manosphere means that you've hit a wall in your development. You need to leave to enter the next stage of learning and understanding. He goes further mentioning the Pareto principle,¬†from my interpretation, 80% of the¬†men here get stuck stroking their own ego, while only 20% actually learn something.



Lessons learned:



- Stop saying that¬†you're 'alpha'. You're seeking validation and feeding your ego.


- Stop making 'red pill' a part of your identity. TRP IS A TOOLBOX.


- Just because someone follows TRP, doesn't mean that they're a worthy source of information or advice. THIS IS WHY EC'S ARE A THING.


- Stop stroking your ego.


- When you get the message, hang up the phone. - credit to Heathcliff


- Make your own rules, and live by them.

- Stop mentally masturbating.

- Be that 20%.




- You HAVE to let go.

9,LTRs and The Food Trap,33,0,33,ftmmfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ftmmfy/ltrs_and_the_food_trap/,33,1585864073.0,"Tag makes it obvious, but: This is a theory I've worked on for some time. It applies mostly to men in or headed for LTR.

Food is a trap.  Don't fall for it.

An LTR partner will almost always try and ""fatten you up."" But that makes me less attractive, you say. Why would she want that?

Simple: It reduces your SMV. 

As someone else said here on a recent ""Best of"" post: Validation is sex for women. Its their primary need, in terms of what they get from men. Sex itself is secondary; its the validation they are after. And having you focused solely on them, and no one else, provides them enormous amounts of validation. What they need beyond that, they will get by wearing low cut shirts to work and leaning over the cubicles of overweight office workers desperate for female attention, to make them drool a while.

Meanwhile, SMV for men is determine by a LARGE margin, by physique. Thats not the ONLY factor, but is a BIG factor. By ""fattening you up"" she is essentially taking you off the sexual market. Making it so that other women, are not even interested. 

This gives her the power. It places your existence, within her frame. Think about if: If you are off the sexual market, Dread Game is impossible. If no one wants your fat ass, she never needs to worry. The power dynamic shifts to favor her to an immense degree. But this also means you can never, ever make her tingle; if there's no risk inherent in the relationship, no dread, her hamster has basically rolled over and gone to sleep...until someone ELSE wakes it up.

Do not let her junk food fixation, become your way of life. She will try. SUbtly, at first. Desert night once per week. Then next thing you know, she's buying potato chips and ice cream on every shopping run. Maybe she knows why she does it; more probably she doesn't even understand her compulsion to fatten up her husband or long time partner. But the fact remains: The result is your removal from the sexual marketplace completely, the utter inability to use dread game, and her complete stranglehold on your sex life and the relationship as a whole.

This leads to staleness and boredom. A complete lack of emotional tingles. And we ALL know where the next step is from there.

1: You have no control over where, when, or to whom you were born.

2: You don‚Äôt have the mental capacity to take control of your life as a child.

3: Some things are just NOT YOUR FAULT.

Now,

You can blame your circumstances on your past, on your poverty, on your race, on your gender, etc. You can point the finger in so many directions, and EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, you are relinquishing control of your own life. Why would you want to do that? Do you want society to dictate your short comings? Do you want society to tell you that you are disadvantaged? Do you want pity, or do you want glory?

What can you do?

Well, the first step is to OWN IT! Take full responsibility. That‚Äôs right. Take the ‚Äúblame‚Äù for things that aren‚Äôt your fault. Why on earth would you do that? Because, it puts you in the driver seat. It gives you the power!

**Owning your life is the first step to changing it.** 

**It isn‚Äôt your fault for how you were raised, but it is 100% your responsibility to overcome your circumstances.** 

Living in housing projects wasn‚Äôt my choice, but the friends I associated with was. **Even though I was too young to make good life decisions, that only allows me to forgive myself for my choices, not deflect responsibility.** 

I chose to break the law. I chose to skip school. I chose not to pay attention and learn. I chose to smoke. I chose to drink. I chose to have sex. I chose to rebel. I chose to refuse to live by my father‚Äôs rules when I moved in with him at 17, and then I chose to live on the street instead of giving in to him. I chose to pursue a rap career, and I chose not to invest back in the business. I chose to party instead. I chose to go out to California with no plan. I chose not to work hard when I got there. I chose to take pills that led to my overdose. I chose to make a change in my life right then and there. Then I chose to call my dad, come home, and join the Navy. I made all of those decisions, but I only took credit for the last few good decisions. The rest, I blamed on my circumstances.

Nothing is going to get better until you accept FULL responsibility for your actions, past and present. You must forgive yourself for the past decisions you‚Äôve made that were during the times you didn‚Äôt have control over your life. You must forgive yourself, but you CAN NOT EXCUSE yourself. You just do your best from now on. You get in the driver‚Äôs seat, **you grab the wheel**, and you steer yourself to the life that YOU choose. It isn‚Äôt easy, and the road may be long and windy, but would you rather sit back seat to someone else‚Äôs adventure? Not me. I choose to drive. What do you choose?",2020-04-01 20:26:45

This is the be all and end all: __why do you fucking care?__

If you‚Äôve been around for TRP a while, you will know what I‚Äôm talking about. Endless questions posted by the new and not so new consumers of the pill. They‚Äôve just found this awesome forum on the internet that is 100% guaranteed to turn them into pussy slaying LVL 99 alpha bro dudes overnight - great.

Asktrp has all the answers they need. They read the sidebar (or don‚Äôt, more often than not), read a couple GLO posts and get motivated to go try this shit in real life. They go do some curls, call a dude a beta, cold approach a girl or 2 and then run into an error. ‚ÄúWhy did this girl take 1 minute longer than usual to reply? I‚Äôm red pilled now, how is this happening? Asktrp will know!‚Äù So they run and ask the internet alphas for advice. They get called a faggot and told to go lift, get some piece of advice, and then they go back about their business. Then they will keep getting spoon fed every time they run to asktrp for help.

_Before asking a question on asktrp, ask yourself this_: **why do I fucking care?**

Why do girls prefer X over Y? Who cares?

Why does X beta male get girls when he is a faggot due to Y reason? Who cares?

Seen a fat beta male pull an HB9 today, how is that possible?

**Who cares? Why do you fucking care?**

14,How To Measure Your Penis Like An Empirical Rational Alpha Male,100,0,100,ft387l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ft387l/how_to_measure_your_penis_like_an_empirical/,37,1585787983.0,"As everyone here knows the Red Pill is not a reactionary ideology that came about as a direct response to the SJW feminism of 2013. No! It is a state of the art research facility where angst ridden virgins, chubby divorced dads and spectrum spergs trade notes on their scientific findings to delve into the mysteries of getting women to ""open bobs and vagine."" The Red Pill is a community of lab coat wearing scientists who analyse 100% true unbiased field reports in order to unlock the secrets of quantum ""All Women Are Whores.""

As rational empirical alpha male sex scientists the logical way to begin our research is by measuring our penises. This however presents the issue of replicability and the need for a Uniform Penis Measurement Standard (UPMS).  How do we determine where the base of the penis truly begins? Is it where the shaft emerges from the fatty mons tissue? Or do we press the ruler into the pelvis to obtain a  measurement at the dick stem? How do we account for odd shapes and curves? Akin to an HB scale, we need to an objective amalgamate unit scale that takes all factors into consideration. A True Penis (TP) value of 1- 10 which factors in all elements including testicle size weight and symmetry, scrotum wrinkling, moles rolls factor, pubic hair trimming, as well as aftermarket decorative elements like jeweled cock rings.

In order to obtain a complete scientific understanding of a particular penis, the penis in question must be submitted to the Uniform Penis Measurement Standard (UPMS) and the True Penis (TP) examination protocols. The Uniform Penis Measurement Standard uses the [Archimedes principle](https://youtu.be/lQEUDsn0p80?t=165) to obtain a volumetric measure of a particular penis. In order to conduct this highly scientific clinical measurement a penis is inserted into a large beaker of 37C distilled water which sits on a scale tared to zero grams. Although a true stoic alpha can obviously maintain an erection during even extremely adverse physical conditions, through extensive testing it was found that the variability of a flaccid penis's volume when inserted into room temperature or colder water was unacceptably high, so body temperature water is recommended for this test. The buoyant force of the water acting upon the inserted penis manifests as an apparent change in the scale's reading, which is then transformed into the desired volume measurement by using rho = ~ 0.993 g/cm3 at 37C for water. This measurement should be repeated at least three times, under both fully erect and flaccid penile states. Despite the objective nature of this measurement, an impartial referee or other official governing body must still be present to observe the procedure to ensure that 1) the scale is indeed tared at the start of the measurement 2) only the shaft is inserted into the water and not additional appendages or foreign objects 3) that the penis is, indeed, completely flaccid for the flaccid portion of this measurement 4) the measurement is not compromised by unnecessary movement or splashing. The use of a shrill whistle or other auditory feedback device during the test by the referee is encouraged to ensure compliance with the Uniform Penis Measurement Standard protocol.

While the UPMS is an objective volumetric measure. True Penis (TP) is a holistic multivariate analysis of all genital aesthetic elements assessed at a 1-10 scale. In order to submit a penis for TP assay, a photograph of both erect and flacid forms must be submitted to a certified TP specialist. These Rational Males have dedicated their entire lives to analyzing men's penises. In fact they are so invested in penile assessment that they have little time to invest in physical health, masculinity or serious intellectual endeavors. All these men have time for is assessing and analysing cocks which is why they are exempt from Red Pill's lifting requirements. If you're are interested in undergoing a TP assessment do not hesitate to contact our specialists. They love getting paid to stare at cocks almost as much as they hate lifting and will get back to you promptly with the proper information on how to submit your specimen.

Now that we have an understanding of the protocols and procedures needed to obtain a complete scientific measurement of a particular penis, the next logical step is interpreting the result. You got your numbers back and their not very good. What do you do now? If that's the case simply abandon hardline biological determinism and adopt a liberal subjectivist attitude. Don't be ashamed to revert to determinism at a later date if it suits your egoic fulfilment. TRP is not about what size of dick is best, but how to have the BEST dick no matter what that means to you. It could be no dick at all.

At this point you have two options: self improvement or self delusion, although the two are not mutually exclusive. Jelquing is the art of pulling on your ding ding in a desperate attempt to make it bigger. It's not about the penis you currently have, its about the penis you one day will have. Jelquing requires patience effort and consistency, qualities that are in short supply among redditers. The second option is ""Faking It Till You Make It"". Pretending the issue is resolved is much easier than actually doing anything about it. Buy a dick sleeve. Using a fixadent like product glue your penis into the dick sleeve. Don't worry about the logistical nightmare of having a plastic penis glued onto your real penis. It's not about the reality of your penis, its about her perceived reality of your penis. 

This brings me to the deep philosophical conclusion 80% of the Red Pill will never comprehend. Is penis measuring both in the literal and metaphorical sense a coping mechanism for living in a castrating NeoLiberal society? Man feels castrated by society so he measures his penis in a desperate attempt to affirm that it is still there. Isn't measuring the penis a castrating act unto itself which inevitably leads to a positive feedback loop of more measurement? Furthermore if penile measurement is itself a symptom shouldn't we seek to overcome it rather than endlessly enjoying the symptom? Isn't it true that the more empirical a man is the more castrated, humorless, boring and lifeless he is? Aren'tt impulsivity and spontaneity key traits that make a man attractive? Then why are we striving for the exact opposite in a community dedicated to helping men get laid? Finally since women find humorless scientific empiricists boring and unattractive shouldn't you instead strive to be a fun guy who writes April Fool's day posts?

As someone who went from lacking it in many aspects of my life to being someone quite sure of themselves, I've weaved through a lot of the crap and stuck with what works and it's really quite simple.

Firstly, you have to understand what confidence is: Confidence ultimately comes down to ones perception of their own self in any particular scenario. How competently you view yourself to be at any given task will determine how much confidence you have in yourself. If you fancy yourself to be good at something, you'll have confidence, if you think you're terrible at it, you'll lack confidence. 

Take driving for example, if you were driving a car for the first time you'd have zero self confidence in your ability. You'd be nervous, anxious and concerned that you may have an accident because you simply don't know how to do it. However, over time as you do it more and more, the more you practice, the better you'll become. After enough practice you'll be able to drive quite competently and the nervousness and anxiety  will dissipate. Eventually you'll get behind the wheel and it will become a mindless task because you've done it so many times before successfully. This is confidence in your driving ability.

This is how your mind and confidence work and you can map it out onto almost anything. If you lack confidence talking to girls, or with your job, or with public speaking it's simply because you haven't practiced it enough or been successful at it enough to be sure of yourself. Your mind recognizes the novelty of it and becomes tentative. The only way to build confidence is to practice it repeatedly until you internalize that you're proficient at it. You need to practice talking to girls, your job or public speaking, become better at it and it and eventually it will become a mindless task the same way driving does, but it takes time. 

Contrary to buzzfeed articles, there are no quick fixes and there are no shortcuts. Most people try something once or a couple times and then tell themselves they don't have no confidence and give up and that's fine, most people lack discipline. If you want to gain confidence you need to understand that the payoff is always gonna be way down the line, compound interest. You just need to have the patience and perseverance to get there. The human mind takes a long time to internalize change. 

The last and most sobering realization is that you won't be able to have a high level of confidence with everything. You'll find somethings you have a knack for and it takes very little practice to become competent(and therefore confident) and there's other things that you can practice a whole lot and don't become very confident at all and this is fine. We're not all gonna be Michael Jordan's or Don Juan's, but you can become better at almost anything by practicing it repeatedly and with that comes more confidence.",2020-04-01 20:50:00
18,"Masculinity as Defiance (expanding on the definition of ""masculinity as power"")",81,0,81,fsllrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fsllrf/masculinity_as_defiance_expanding_on_the/,17,1585718423.0,"**Excerpt from [Defiance on the Road to Decay](https://killtoparty.com/2018/12/16/defiance-decay-and-scott-weiland/)**


**If masculinity is power, there is a defiance in masculinity.** The masculine man lives on his own terms, resisting the world‚Äôs inertia insisting he conform. He assesses risk and reward, and takes pride in making his own decisions.

No better a glimpse of defiant masculinity than the combat sports fighter. He understands the game- he evaluates the risk, he visualizes the reward. Even the losing fighter garners the respect of participation- the only participation trophy that matters- and walks away with a warrior‚Äôs honor and the gorgeous women who find that irresistible.

**The feminized world cannot come to grips with the defiance of masculinity.** It misunderstands the high-risk/high-reward dichotomy and believes the participants are *unaware* of the risks or else they wouldn‚Äôt hunt for the rewards. The feminized worldview is steeped in consumerism- the proverbial activity punch-card at summer camp; the bucket-list life- where the longer life is understood as the better life. If not for a long life, how else will you enjoy food, wine, and travel?

This worldview is ideal for women, who are natural consumers. **Western civilization has always been arranged for female comfort, and without the constraints of expectation- modern women are no longer expected to be‚Ä¶ much of anything**- life becomes an endless summer camp.

The bugman exists as an infection of consumerism. To the bugman, there is no higher degree of satisfaction than money and women- not wicked in their own right, but neither should be ends in themselves. **The masculine man will demand a deeper experience, spitting in the face of risk to attain something which transcends what the bug can understand.** When a bug‚Äôs goal is money and women they‚Äôll settle for achieving either with the least amount of energy exerted- leaving them enslaved to a master both at home and at work.

Productivity can be an abyss.

**When a man transcends the feminine, summer camp, bucket-list life and becomes attune to looking at his time on Earth as productivity maximization**- pure creative output, total content-mindset- he looks for ways to squeeze the most blood from a stone. How can I sleep best, when it‚Äôs time to sleep, and work hardest when it‚Äôs time to work- risks, be damned. It was toward the waning days of Spring when I discovered Kratom.

19,STIs and plates,236,0,236,fsc92e,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fsc92e/stis_and_plates/,151,1585687432.0,"So I‚Äôm going to tell you guys about STIs I caught while wearing a condom. Recently contracted Molluscum Contagiosum from a plate I used to hook up with a few months back.

I also caught genital warts in the past (gross af). I managed to napalm them off with a soldering iron and fix it (it doesn‚Äôt leave scars boys, unless it‚Äôs on your cock or scrotum, leave that to the professionals). Compared to molluscum, hpv warts are a breeze, easier to contain and you can still have a sex life.

These molluscum things are a different story. They spread like wild fire. Doctors don‚Äôt take it seriously, in fact no one does, so the choices for treatment are limited. And you‚Äôll have to insist, because most doctors will tell you to leave it because it ‚Äúresolves on its own‚Äù. Do your research and you‚Äôll see what I mean.

Tips to make sure the lady you‚Äôre about to smash is STI/STD free. (Obviously, wear a condom)

1: TURN THE LIGHT ON, MAKE IT BRIGHT AND CLINICAL.

2: Know how to distinguish between folliculitis (shaving bumps) and actual STIs.

3: Take your time when looking, don‚Äôt rush it. You can go down there, pleasure her while looking without putting your mouth on it.

4: Ask her if she‚Äôs clean (in some countries if you contract an STD from someone and they don‚Äôt let you know you can sue)

5: If the paranoia gets to you, fuck her while in boxers (the kind that has an opening in front). This is last resort and for the true warriors who don‚Äôt mind looking like a twat while shagging.

Tips for living with these 2 STIs:

1: It takes time for your body to fight the virus, you have to be on top of it and halt the spread, every bit helps.

2: If you‚Äôre about to hook up and you‚Äôre infectious, be honest, if she isn‚Äôt down, you‚Äôll eventually find a girl who is. I‚Äôve done it and you can too. If you take the right precautions, you can be safe. Just be smart.

3: Be healthy, eat the right things, don‚Äôt drink or smoke too much and exercise often.

4: Don‚Äôt beat yourself up about it. Shit happens, be thankful it isn‚Äôt something worse.

5: Keep talking to women.

Tl;dr - turn the fucking light on and know what you‚Äôre looking for

EDIT - yes, I didn‚Äôt do the check (duh) So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm telling you cunts now, CHECK and KNOW what to look for. I could‚Äôve avoided this and the thousands I‚Äôve spent on doctors appointments if I just did the check. Molluscum is tricky, you have to know the difference between molluscum bumps and folliculitis. Don‚Äôt be fooled, molluscum cases are rapidly increasing

21,Quarantine has reminded me how comfortable I am being by myself.,329,0,329,frmzf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/frmzf8/quarantine_has_reminded_me_how_comfortable_i_am/,28,1585585600.0,"Five years ago, I left the small town I grew up in to move to the big city and begin university for the second time. I was extremely driven at the time for not only by the career prospects of doing a PhD, but also by the social opportunities of living in the UK's second biggest city. 

  
Previously being very shy and inexperienced socially, I threw myself into he social environment and nightlife of my new home. I was out on the town twice a week, and going too peoples homes as well to relax most evening.

  
Whilst I felt my confidence grew, and I was unaware of a insecurity that was taking seed in me: The expectation I had for myself to be out and socializing all the time. 

When Friday or Saturday lunch time would come around, I'd start messaging friends the classic 'Wuu2' to see what was up. If it turns out that my close friends where busy or not going out, and I begin to panic. ""I don't have any friends going out tonight, that means I'm going to be stuck indoors on a Friday night like a friendless looser!"".

I use to get really anxious about not going out, I use to try 'booking' people into going out a weekend or so in advance just so I felt secure. One Friday night, I was having the usually stuck in doors panic when it struck me ""No one fives a fuck what I'm doing tonight"" and with that revelation, I slammed my PS3 on and played Final Fantasy all night.  


I didn't get into a habit of playing Computer games on a weekend after this, but I did feel more comfortable leading up to the weekend and when I didn't go out. I also probably got on with my friends more, being less manipulative in trying to get them to go out.  


Fast forward 7 years to today, and these old securities are plaguing me. I live in a small town, with most of my close friends being an hour and a half away. I have to make an effort to drive to see them at least once a month, otherwise I start to feel like a friendless failure, watching life go by.  


The UK has been on quarantine for two weeks now. I've not seen face-to-face anyone but my parents and sister. It around this time that I should be feeling anxious and self-pressured to go and see people, but instead, I'm perfectly fine. The quarantine has imposed a hard limit on me seeing people, and as a result, I'm fine with my seclusion.   


I spent this weekend cleaning up, organizing both myself both physically and mentally, meditating, and sending funny meme's to my close friends. If I hadn't been for this hard limit, I'd start to feel stressed and anxious, but those are just due to my expectations, they're not due to any actual sense of loneliness.  


This week I learnt that I am totally happy by myself, and that I need to use that a solid foundation to build both my personal and social life.",2020-03-30 16:26:40
22,The Narrative of Heartbreak,27,0,27,frtveo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/frtveo/the_narrative_of_heartbreak/,8,1585614227.0,"**In a flash Fake Winehouse was able to transform our hetero-normative experience back into something she was more comfortable with**, her own safe space of *gender neutrality*, with the magic words: ‚Äúget this shit off me.‚Äù Tossing her the tissue box, I chastised her for *breaking the narrative*, something usually reserved for slightly longer than fifteen seconds after sex.

Winehouse may have rolled her eyes, but the fact of the matter remains: **sex is the narrative of attraction**. For the red-hot 20 minutes I spent with Amy, she behaved like the ideal submissive- this is what she wanted in the moment. After, when her big girl brain came back, the feminist became disgusted with herself, and, ‚Äúget this shit off me,‚Äù was her way of re-framing the mess she‚Äôd made by bending to my will.

**Sex is like editing together a documentary film. Everything is based in reality, but it‚Äôs up to you to put together the story. Initial attraction may be there, but if you don‚Äôt string things together the right way, you‚Äôre not getting laid.**

Both sexes have their role in building this narrative. It‚Äôs too easy to reduce the female‚Äôs role to that of a movie goer or theater attendee; ‚Äújust start the damn show and hope I don‚Äôt walk out.‚Äù Although there is truth to that dynamic, the woman has her part in showing up *fit for the performance*.

If she‚Äôs had the bad luck of being out with a doofus, only minimal effort is required. The slightest exertion of feminine prowess will allow her total control of the situation. These aesthetic stakes will rise along-side the value of the man interested. By the time she shows up to the date, he‚Äôll already know if he wants to fuck her or not- from there, as long as she doesn‚Äôt commit an egregious, narrative disrupting crime of anti-sexuality, her job is mostly done- any further action on her part is for sport.

As a man falls under the aesthetic spell of a woman, he‚Äôll construct the rest of the narrative on his own with very little input from her. Did she try to make a joke? It‚Äôs hysterical! Did she make a rather obvious observation? She‚Äôs so smart! Is there any kind of minor nuance to her behavior that can be focused on and doted over? She‚Äôs adorable!

His misguided interpretation of her qualities will remain until his attraction for her has been extinguished, which may be accompanied by feelings of sadness, guilt, shame, or even disgust, depending on the particulars of the situation.

Since anything beyond her aesthetic may be his narrative imposing on reality, there isn‚Äôt a lingering question of authenticity. Ironically, the authenticity of her beauty is actually debatable- women have an entire arsenal of weapons to deceive the gullible- however, most men are only looking for surface level approval.

Conversely, **authenticity is a central question for her- an on-going issue to which her attraction to him is contingent upon.**

She will also see what she wants and lie to herself, but rather than constructing a false narrative based on his aesthetic, she magnifies the fragments of his personality that she finds attractive and comes to the conclusion that he ‚Äúmust always be like that.‚Äù

This is as much a naive fantasy as his personifying her beauty into the idealized girlfriend. While he‚Äôs putting his best foot forward on their date in an attempt to have a sex worthy performance, she‚Äôs going along for the ride believing that he‚Äôs being himself and this decisive, assertive, cool and confident guy is *just who he is*.

Only it isn‚Äôt so easy- women are savvier in this department than men. **She‚Äôll subconsciously match his behavior to what he looks like while trying to determine if he should be entitled to acting so decisive, assertive, cool and confident. And if this scan turns up negative, she‚Äôll think he‚Äôs faking his swagger and aggressively test the depth of his authenticity.**

If he‚Äôs able to hold this frame together for long enough, he‚Äôll get laid.
--

**All human relationships contain a degree of narrative, requiring effort and social pruning, because we‚Äôre really just animals on a dirty rock floating in space.** But, yes, we have the capacity of forming intimate relationships with one another, and that can be a great experience‚Ä¶ or a devastatingly disappointing experience‚Ä¶ or something so torturous that it becomes mentally crippling. Even the bonds of family are held together by narrative- and if this seems inaccurate to you, you likely don‚Äôt know the pain of a distant mother or an absent father‚Ä¶ or, even a murderous mother.

**There is no greater emotional pain than of a narrative dissolving.** Death, of course, is the ultimate narrative dissolution‚Ä¶ but short of an ending so dramatic, there is an element of innocence lost for good when a relationship falls into disrepair. When you can take a step back and recognize the true peak, the trust and good feelings that went with it, and even if you‚Äôre not conscious of the narrative elements that engendered the connection, you‚Äôre highly aware of your new status as strangers.

If we can crystallize heartbreak to a single moment, it would be the intersection between confidant and stranger.

23,Why you Should Consider Joining a Frat if You're in College,7,0,7,frrlae,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/frrlae/why_you_should_consider_joining_a_frat_if_youre/,10,1585606642.0,"I‚Äôm currently a 20-year-old college student. I‚Äôm in my second year. The most important thing I did for my social life was to join a fraternity. 

Before I get into the details of why joining a fraternity can positively impact your social life and your game with girls, I want to talk a little bit about my past. 

High school was hell for me. It was the worst experience of my life. I didn‚Äôt really have friends despite desperately wanting to be popular. The friends that I did have were also kind of losers like me. Great guys, but we never really had the fun that the popular guys had.  I never went to parties. I never even had kissed at girl in high school. This partly had to do with the way I was raised. 

I decided to go to a college that was several hours away from home. First year was okay. I made some friends, went to some parties‚Ä¶ But there was something missing. 

I struggled making ‚Äúreal‚Äù friends and having a group to belong to. The parties and social events that I did go to were never truly organized. They sort of just happened. I made some friends, but I did not have an abundance of friends. 

This year, everything changed. A couple guys from one of my classes were part of a frat. At the time, I didn‚Äôt really know much about what a frat was. Like everyone else, I had all these negative connotations associated with the word. ‚ÄúAll they do is drink and party‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou have to pay to have friends, how stupid is that‚Äù. 

Turns out, I couldn‚Äôt be more wrong. I remembered that a few guys on this subreddit had talked about the benefits of a frat. So, I decided to express some interest early in the process. 

The two guys from my class took a liking of me. They invited me to a couple invents so that I could meet the rest of the guys. I thought it was a great group of guys and they liked me too. 

I met some of the other potential pledges (people thinking about joining), and I liked them too. I convinced a couple friends of mine to join with me, and they did. My social life, and my game have greatly improved as a result. Without further ado, here are the 3 reasons why you should join a frat if you‚Äôre in college: 

**1) Abundance.** 

As I talked about, I now have an abundance of parties and social events that I can go to. I have a fee that I pay every semester, but that‚Äôs about it. Almost all these events are optional. It‚Äôs a great way to go out and have fun. Also, you‚Äôre no longer the guy who‚Äôs actively searching for fun stuff to do. Instead, you‚Äôre the guy in control. You get to invite people and throw parties. I no longer feel desperate for friends or for fun. I have an abundance of it. With this, comes a very attractive and calm attitude. Furthermore, the friendships that I made feel real to me.

**2) Networking, Career and Philanthropy.**  

A frat isn‚Äôt just about the parties. Most of the guys in my frat are in my program. Some are older than me and have access to notes and textbooks that they can lend me. Some have great advice on what courses to take, how to manage money‚Ä¶The frat that I now belong to, is a big one in North America. Some very successful people have been a part of it throughout the years. This can be very helpful for your career. We also have a ton of philanthropy events. We get to go out and help the community and just be good human beings. 

**3) Girls.** 

Now that I‚Äôm in a frat, it‚Äôs much easier to meet girls. One way is through the parties and social events that we have every week. But we also have relations with sororities and events with them. Joining a frat is like social circle game to the max, at least from my experience. A lot of the frat guys have a lot of friends who are girls, so you‚Äôre bound to meet them at some point. Then you‚Äôre circle just keeps getting bigger and bigger. With that, your confidence increases. 

In conclusion, a frat can help you with just about everything when you‚Äôre in college. With girls, with having an abundance of options when it comes to events and parties, with school grades, with networking, with career options, and even with philanthropy and building yourself as a man. 

Overall, it‚Äôs been a great experience for me. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs for everyone. But if you are anything like who I was, someone who was really struggling socially and needed a group to belong to. Someone who quite honestly didn‚Äôt really have the balls for cold approach. Someone who often found himself in isolation. Someone who was hungry for success in other areas of life, such as business, but who couldn‚Äôt quite concentrate because his social needs weren‚Äôt being met. If you are anything like I used to be, then consider joining a frat. 

The most important thing is to meet the people that a part of it. Make sure you vibe with them. Make sure that you can see these people as your friends, most importantly the other people thinking of joining (since you‚Äôll be spending most of your time with them at first). Maybe try to get a couple of your friends involved with you, if you have friends. Of course, make sure that you have the means to be paying their fee every semester. 

If anyone has any questions I‚Äôll be happy to answer.",2020-03-30 22:17:22
24,Drugiecom's Guide on Maxing your Looks,71,0,71,fre0a5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fre0a5/drugiecoms_guide_on_maxing_your_looks/,83,1585547203.0,"I made a comment a while back on a guide on how to max your looks, I was surprised to find out that a couple of members messaged me to make a thread on this stuff. 

Here we are.

&#x200B;

**Why should you improve your looks?**

If you truly think that looks do not matter you are truly delusional and the circle jerk of ""Red Pill"" nowadays has gotten to your head, I am sorry to all TRP funs but I've been here long enough to realize that the circle jerk and YouTubers filling this sub with recycled content is beyond control. 

Yes, looks do matter and it's something that everyone in the Red Pill community should try to improve if you don't try to improve your looks you are not someone who *lives* the Red Pill lifestyle in my books.

Plus this is evidence-backed, do your own research.

&#x200B;

# Haircut & Facial Hair

**Balding** ***-*** If you are **CURRENTLY** balding (receding hairline), buy a derma roller (along with minoxidil) as your first line of defense and use some DHT blockers(this needs more research on your part). [https://moreplatesmoredates.com](https://moreplatesmoredates.com/) blog and YouTube channel has some of the best content on the subject.

&#x200B;

**Bald -** If you are already bald there are three things you can do. Embrace it and go on from there, but yes being bald will ""decrease your SMV"" but there are plenty chicks out there that will be more than willing to rub their pussy in your shiny head or get a Toup√©e. The best solution would be to do a hair transplant, costly but probably your best option for natural-looking hair.

&#x200B;

**Haircut -** Your haircut plays a major factor on how good you look. The best styles are the ones that fit your face shape the best. There are \~6 of face shapes: Oval, round, square, heart, rectangle (aka oblong), and diamond.

&#x200B;

>***Oval*** Face is longer than it is wide, with the jaw being a bit more narrow than the forehead. The jaw is slightly narrower than the forehead and tapers down towards the chin. Lines are fairly soft.  
>  
>***Round*** Babyface basically. Like oval but with vertical and horizontal ratios being almost identical.  
>  
>***Square*** Like a round face but with hard edges. Prominent jawline and compact midface.  
>  
>***Heart*** Prominent forehead tapering down into narrow or pointed chin.  
>  
>***Rectangle*** like oval but with sharper lines. leads to typical horse face appearance.  
>  
>***Diamond*** like oval but cheekbones are the widest part. narrow forehead and chin area with angular bone structure. Usually somewhat large gonial angle and high hyoid bone.

&#x200B;

After you have identified your face shape what cut should you get for it?

>**OVAL:**  
>  
>Very versatile. One of the most ‚Äúflexible‚Äù face shapes feel free to experiment tend to look better with short styles.  
>  
>*Caution:* Stay away from too much height/volume on top.  
>  
>**ROUND:**  
>  
>Keep hair short on sides and back, long on top. Volume/height products are your best friend, try and grow facial hair.  
>  
>**SQUARE:**  
>  
>Hair should aim to soften the harsh lines of the upper face. Messy, medium length hair is the best bet. This is the best type of shape to pull off a buzzcut, use facial hair to soften harsh jaw angle  
>  
>**HEART:**  
>  
>Stay the fuck away from short hair, use long or medium length up top swept over to mask large forehead. Use facial hair to fill out jaw  
>  
>**RECTANGLE:**  
>  
>Stay away from short sides or cuts that give volume up top, don‚Äôt grow a beard.  
>  
>You can probably pull off slicked back hair.  
>  
>**DIAMOND:**  
>  
>Go with a fringe, long on top covering some of the forehead.  
>  
>You can grow facial hair or not, up to you.

If you are still not sure Instagram models, Tumblr, fashion blogs and Pinterest are your friends.

DO NOT cheap out and go on a shitty barber, most of them have no idea how to style and cut hair for specific face shape. Go to a professional and when the cut is done take some pics that you can so to your barber for reference and hopefully he doesn't fuck it up.

&#x200B;

**Beard -** Watch [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLLaHc22qAU) video, If you can't grow a beard and it makes you look like a Shaggy from Scooby-Doo knock off, then cut that shit. 

&#x200B;

# Skin

**Acne -** If your acne is hormonal then you have to let do its work, you can hop over the skincareaddiction subreddit and other skincare subreddits for advice on how to handle the situation and improve it. If you are not in your teens that means that there is something wrong with you, thus you have acne. This probably is your diet (which will discuss later on) or other issues, once again skincareaddiction subreddit is your friend, but make sure to check with your doctor.

&#x200B;

**Skin Texture -** I am using Tretinoin for this, however, this can also fuck up your skin so do your own research. Skincare subs are your holy grail for this.

&#x200B;

**Tan -** Tanning can greatly improve someone's appearance, please do not use those tanning creams that at the end make you look like some Manchester Girl.

You should aim for a Medium Brown color [here is a reference image on tanning levels.](https://1luicn4uholwsc2jlmo5w1ad-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/evoderma-fitzpatrick-skin-tone-scale-SM.png) 

How should you tan? Other than sprays and creams which are temporary and can make you look like the annoying orange, I suggest you go to a Tanning bed or even better a Beach.

If you can't tan for shit or in general want to tan faster lookup ""Melanotan 2"" and read up on it, the Peptides sub might come in a handful (be careful with this, this stuff ain't something to mess around with and the boners from it are no joke).

&#x200B;

# Diet and Fitness

**Diet -** Diet is a controversial subject, no, it's not that I am scared that vegan soy boys will come after me but simply that you have to see how you react to specific food and act accordingly, I cannot tolerate carbs thus I went with SCD (Specific Carbohydrate Diet from the book ""Breaking the Vicious Cycle"" the book is worth a read especially if you suffer from Crohn's/IBD, etc).

In my opinion, start with a Ray Peat inspired diet such as [Thermo30](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1153/7200/files/Thermo30_Fat_Loss.png?v=1524509549) or this one.

**Fitness -** Lift weights(make sure to have correct form otherwise you are stupid), do HIIT  and use the Buteyko method. Maybe some calisthenics for showing off. 

You should aim to stay at around 12% BodyFat since that is where most people look the best.

Jeff Nippard, Jeff Cavaliere, MorePlatesMoreDates and my personal favourite John Meadows are your friends. Don't fall for traps like ""6 minute abs"" bullshit.

**DO NOT, buy workout programs,** without trying them first.

Try out a program and then buy it from the creator, people may disagree with me on this but this is safer than falling for shitty workout programs.

26,"Didn‚Äôt Cling, Didn‚Äôt Mate Guard, Didn‚Äôt Care",298,0,298,fr4t4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fr4t4z/didnt_cling_didnt_mate_guard_didnt_care/,72,1585511811.0,"So I met this girl on campus. Was waiting with a bunch of friends to go climbing with the climbing club, and saw her walking past: blonde, tan, long legs in tight shorts. Damn, better get me a girl like that, I thought. Well she walks over to us. She‚Äôs here to try out climbing. Nice.

We all take the train together. I catch her name and find out she‚Äôs a medical student. Quickly see the twitchy neurosis and snarling rage hidden behind her eyes. This girl has a good dose of angry crazy, easy to tell. Very tightly wound. I‚Äôm kind of into it. After initial greetings I ignore her to speak to my friend. There‚Äôs another guy in the group obviously hitting on her and telling her his life story. Do I attempt to speak to her more? No.

We get to the climbing wall and as regulars of the club it‚Äôs our responsibility to teach the newbies how to tie in and belay and all that so they don‚Äôt kill themselves or their partners. I could have offered to teach her, and she looks at me imploringly. But I don‚Äôt. I teach some Asian kid instead and she gets paired with blabbermouth who eagerly jumps at the chance. She looks mildly disappointed. Do I try to spend more time with her? No. In fact, I ignore her the rest of the day and leave at the end without saying a word to her.
_________________________________________________________

A week or so later I decide to go to a hiking club meet. We‚Äôre doing a short walk and then going to a pub to socialise. Whatdy‚Äôknow, med student girl is there again, looking fine as ever and very North Face. After initial greetings and ‚Äúoh we met before‚Äù I ignore her for the rest of the walk, and speak to *everyone else except her*.
 
At the pub half the people leave and we all sit down to get drinks. I‚Äôm speaking to everyone including her now, as we‚Äôre in a group. Conversation is quite good and I can tell she‚Äôs pretty smart, but ofc, wound up in the ‚ÄúI hate myself but I‚Äôll take it out on everyone else‚Äù kind of way. Other guys are all interrupting each other to get a word in with her.  

There‚Äôs a really cute goth bartender at the bar. Has the kind of sleepy, spaced out vibe to her. One of the guys obviously has a crush on her because he can‚Äôt stop staring and keeps going over to get drinks directly from her. I tell him to just go for it, hit on her bro. He‚Äôs like, nah‚Ä¶ too scared. I say ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt hit on her I will‚Äù, he says ‚Äúbe my guest‚Äù. The med girl is grinning at me like ‚Äúis he actually going to do it?‚Äù, and ofc, I get up, walk over to her, tell her she‚Äôs really cute. ‚ÄúWhen does your shift end?‚Äù she tells me a time which was much later; normally I‚Äôd wait around to meet them if it was soon but that won‚Äôt happen this time. ‚ÄúOkay can I get your number then?‚Äù, she‚Äôs quite taken aback and of course says yes. ‚ÄúDo you get many guys hitting on you then?‚Äù I ask her, ‚ÄúNot really‚Äù she says, and blushes.

I walk back to the table and they‚Äôre all mouths agape impressed like I‚Äôd just did a backflip or something. ‚ÄúWhoah dude that was smooth‚Äù, ‚ÄúThanks‚Äù. Blondie is grinning with her big white teeth and giving me the ‚Äúbend me over and fuck me right now‚Äù eyes.  The guy next to me asks me (out of earshot of medthot) how I learned to do something like that and I tell him ‚Äúpractice, after failing many, many times and embarrassing myself‚Äù. 

As the people trickle away over time I‚Äôm left talking to medthot. We have a nice conversation and I tell her I‚Äôll take her climbing sometime again. She‚Äôs totally up for it and gives me her number. Important note here: plausible deniability. It‚Äôs not a date, I didn‚Äôt ask her out. I said I‚Äôd take her climbing. I‚Äôm doing *her* a favour, imparting my experience onto her. It‚Äôs just friendly, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm doing it because I want my dick inside her. Obviously‚Ä¶.

____________________________________________________________

So a week later I text her out of the blue telling her I‚Äôm going climbing on Wednesday if she wants to come.  She replies like five times, and then bombards me with texts on the day as well like ‚ÄúI will be 5 mins late‚Äù, ‚Äúwhere are you?‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm nervous haha‚Äù, ‚ÄúDo I need this and that etc etc etc‚Äù. I ignore most of them and reply with one word to the relevant ones. Text message ratio is like 5:95 me to her, at this point I know I have her.

So we go climbing and it‚Äôs more time to speak together more intimately and I tease her and make jokes about her competence and I use the excuse of tying her in and helping her out to put my hands on her, her hips, her waist, her hair etc. She‚Äôs blushing and I think getting a bit turned on and after we finish I just leave. Don‚Äôt ask her to extend the date or anything‚Ä¶ well it was just platonic climbing together after all right? She‚Äôs a bit disappointed by this and asks me if we‚Äôll go climbing again soon and I say maybe and leave. 

Do I beg to see her again? Do I make her any promises? No. Left her hanging completely.
______________________________________

Well another week later where I don‚Äôt message her at all, I text her that I‚Äôm going to a party and she should come with me. Ofc she plays a bit coy at first like ‚ÄúI might be busy, who‚Äôs party idk the people etc etc‚Äù but I just ignore the texts entirely. On the day of the party I text ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pick you up from your place where do you live?‚Äù and she sends me the address. 

So I meet her at the front door and she‚Äôs all Urban Outfitters and looks nice, and we go to get booze and walk to the house party. As we walk we have a dark conversation and I can really pick up on her overt rage and superiority complex; she is a med student and I‚Äôm not and that makes her better than me. To be fair, she must be really smart, she gets great grades and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to get her grades or even get accepted onto her course, so her raw power and anger translates somewhere. But it also means she belittles literally everyone else who isn‚Äôt a Med student and thinks of herself as queen. 

We get to the party and there‚Äôs barely anyone there, we‚Äôre not that early, and the people there are kinda nerdy, I cringe because I took this girl to a lame party. But do I apologise and make excuses? Nah, I just go with it. We meet all my friends who I haven‚Äôt seen in a while, and they‚Äôre used to me bringing a conveyer belt of girls to these things and they talk about all the usual things ‚Äúwhere are you from, what do you study‚Äù etc. I can see just how proud she is whenever she says ‚ÄúI study medicine‚Äù. It‚Äôs so funny. My friends respect me a bit more now because she isn‚Äôt just a dumb bimbo and she‚Äôs also hottest girl at the party by far.

Well the party fills up with actual cool people eventually and as it does so I don‚Äôt trail around with her like a dog. I let her do her own thing and go and hang out with other people. We bump into each other occasionally and at one point another girl shows up who‚Äôs tied for or even slightly hotter than her and I can tell she hates her immediately. The girl, who I have history with, is polite and friendly with everyone but literally ignores me and medthot.  Medthot seems a bit insulted by this. A bit later on she asks me if I‚Äôm going to hit on her like I did with the bartender, in a jokey way of course, and I tell her ‚ÄúNo, not with her, we don‚Äôt have a good relationship, we ignore each other now‚Äù.

This set her cogs turning and she starts asking me more questions about her and I tell her, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk about it. Drop it‚Äù and she says ‚ÄúOh, okay‚Äù and does. Truth is, this girl rejected me recently and was very bitchy about it, I hit on her quite overtly and she was disgusted by it. Now she ignores me and thinks I‚Äôm a creep. That‚Äôs fine‚Ä¶ but medthot doesn‚Äôt need to know this, and I can spin it in such a way that she thinks we fucked or something. Plus I can rub medthot in rejection girls face. 

So we‚Äôre going round the party and another dude shows up. He is an acquaintance of mine, friend of my friends, and we‚Äôre on good terms but not exactly close. He‚Äôs fucked girls I‚Äôve been into and I‚Äôve fucked girls he‚Äôs been into and it‚Äôs stupid to say there‚Äôs a rivalry there but I think there is, even though it‚Äôs dumb. He is very handsome, more attractive than me, has a chill stoner vibe, and now the chaddest guy at the party. Whatever, I‚Äôll only get mogged if I allow myself to get mogged. We have a friendly chat and I can see that he‚Äôs taking an interest in medthot and she‚Äôs taking glances at him. Great.

So what are my options? Guard her all night, be cold and distanced, tell her to stay away from him, or just sit back and let it happen? Well there‚Äôs only one option really. I introduced them to each other. Not doing so implies saltiness, and I had to be courteous to save face and keep that dgaf vibe. I could see the hungry ‚Äúwow he‚Äôs hot‚Äù sparkle in her eye which feltbadman, and he was being really smooth and chill with her and they were focusing the conversation at each other and I started to feel like a fucking thirdwheel so I left to talk to some other girls. 

Idk what they spoke about but eventually she came back to me and we had a good time the rest of the party, shared a few cigarettes with otherChad, and then left. I told her I would walk her home. Important that there was precedent that I picked her up from her place, now it‚Äôs not about discovering her house for the first time, but instead taking her back to somewhere familiar.

I kiss her on the journey there and hold her hand and when we get to her place I tell her that I need to pee (this was actually true) and she is hesitant but I think she was just looking for an excuse to let me in. We get up to her flat and I pee and then go into her bedroom and start kissing her and the rest is textbook, bit of ASD, but get through in the end and the sex was quite bad. She was eager yet inexperienced and I just collapsed, fell asleep and left in the morning.
______________________

I meet her one more time at my place a few days later. She was hesitant at first and had to wrangle a bit to get her to meet up again. Bad sign. I tell her we‚Äôre going to cook together. 

Cooking together is my favourite date of all because it sets a power dynamic and allows you to lead her, lets you show competence, gives her a plausibly deniable excuse to come to your place, and your bedroom is right within reach. Ticks all the boxes.

We cook pasta and salmon and I‚Äôm in charge and show her simple things like chopping onions. She doesn‚Äôt really know how because she‚Äôs a spoilt rich girl but she really enjoys being bossed around like this and the whole time I‚Äôm pinching her ass and kissing her and picking her up and just being affectionate in a way that she wasn‚Äôt used to. We go to my bedroom and she tells me her life story (god I‚Äôve heard a million life stories by now) and I am resistant to telling her mine and remain mysterious and closed off. I do tell her that I‚Äôm not looking for a girlfriend and I‚Äôm seeing two other girls at the moment and she shouldn‚Äôt expect anything serious. She seems a bit taken aback but also impressed by this. I ask her to suck my dick and after some resistance she does so and it was the scariest and most aggressive blowjob of my life I thought she‚Äôd fucking rip my foreskin off she was so violent with that thing and I couldn‚Äôt cum out of fear so I told her to just lay down on my thigh and jerked off onto her face.

________________

Well a few days later I ask her to meet up again and she says we need to talk about something and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúgreat‚Ä¶ oh well‚Äù. And we meet in a park and she gives me this whole, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the wrong time for me. I don‚Äôt want to be your third girlfriend. The way you talk about women offends me etc etc‚Äù. I tell her she‚Äôs being dramatic and acting like she‚Äôs in a reality tv show. She tells me that she told her friends all about me and they told her to run away because I‚Äôm a horrible person. Fucking ‚Äúfriends‚Äù man. Girl‚Äôs friends always sabotage it for each other. Always bitching at each other about their guys‚Ä¶ and when is the advice ever ‚Äústay with him‚Äù? They‚Äôre always telling their friends to break up.

Whatever, cool, we won‚Äôt see each other anymore. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll still talk though right?‚Äù She wants to keep me on as an orbiter. Lol. ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. I tell her. ‚ÄúI will block your number‚Äù. ‚ÄúOh, okay‚Äù. She looks sad about it.
__________________

I don‚Äôt block her number but I do ignore every text she sends me for the next few months. Polite things like ‚ÄúI just saw you on campus lol‚Äù or ‚ÄúAre you going climbing this week?‚Äù She‚Äôs trying to reconnect with me, by giving me openings to ask her out again, this is the way women do it, they‚Äôre never overt about wanting you back. I ignore her.

At climbing and the hiking trips I see her there. She looks very pretty. I ignore her and talk to other people. Sometimes I bring other girls that I‚Äôm dating, plates or potential plates that are prettier or more extraverted or blonder than her. She gives me quick glances but maintains her distance. I see it in her eyes, she wants me back. If the sex was better, maybe, but atm, nah‚Ä¶.

______________________

A few weeks later I‚Äôm sitting at the cafeteria eating my lunch when I notice the chad from the party. We say hi and sit together. He asks me about the medthot and what happened between us. I tell him the truth. ‚ÄúWe met like two times and she dumped me but tbh I don‚Äôt mind that much the sex was bad and she was really high maintentance and kind of crazy‚Äù.

He tells me that he‚Äôs been hooking up with her for a few months now and yes she is crazy. 

Of course... What did I expect?

I smile at him. I‚Äôm not actually as hurt as I thought I would be, in fact I find it kind of funny. If he was looking to get me upset or anything, it didn‚Äôt work.

‚ÄúWell you lasted longer than I did bro haha‚Äù I tell him.

‚ÄúYeah man I went deep... it was bad‚Äù. He has to go to his class so we bump fists and I spend the rest of the day with a smile on my face and a good mood. Whores will be whores. Just accept it.
_____________________________________

I run into her a month later, on campus. I can‚Äôt just ignore her now because that would imply saltiness. We have a brief conversation. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm walking this way, walk with me?‚Äù I ask her. ‚ÄúSure"" she says.

‚ÄúI saw (otherChad) the other day‚Äù I say to her. She gives me that toothy grin again when I bring up his name. She didn‚Äôt think I knew, or at least didn‚Äôt expect me to mention him. She likes the idea of me finding out and being hurt. I can tell. It‚Äôs that bitter rage again. 

‚ÄúWhat did he say?‚Äù She‚Äôs being hesitant to reveal too much. Probing.

‚ÄúOh, we just both agreed you‚Äôre crazy‚Äù

She laughs. ‚ÄúWell he‚Äôs just mad because I dumped him and he was *so* in love with me and got all emotional and wouldn‚Äôt stop texting me af-‚Äú

‚ÄúAh, ah‚Äù I put a finger to her lips. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hear it‚Äù.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt want to hear what?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to hear you badmouthing my friends. That‚Äôs between you and him. You shouldn‚Äôt be telling me these things. I like him. I don‚Äôt want my perception of him changed‚Äù

‚ÄúOh okay‚Äù She looks a bit taken aback.

We walk in silence for a bit more.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to a party this weekend if you want to come‚Äù she says.

I think about it. ‚ÄúMaybe‚Äù.

27,The most important part of game is not being emotionally invested,161,0,161,fqxj32,https://theredarchive.com/post/42531,18,1585475582.0,,2020-03-29 09:53:02
28,The importance of becoming better at what you want.,56,0,56,fqvksc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fqvksc/the_importance_of_becoming_better_at_what_you_want/,13,1585468345.0,"A lot of us ended up on this sub for a simple reason: we wanted to get better with women. Why? Because we operated under the fallacy women would make us happy. For lots of us The Red Pill has 5 steps. 

1.) You read literature and it tells you to improve in certain areas of your life. You do what the literature says.

2.) The self improvement isn‚Äôt working nearly as fast as you‚Äôd like, so you complain. At this point people either stagnate and never pass this stage or continue to improve themselves regardless.

3.) Women begin showing attraction towards you. It appears the self improvement is working. Plus, you feel much happier then before.

4.) You slack on the improvement, now believing that you are good enough for any woman of your desires. Even though you continue to get laid you become less and less happy. As you become less happy you start getting laid less. At this point another crossroads presents itself. Either you backtrack to step 2 or ascend to step 5.

5.) You realize women were not the source of ur happiness in step 3. It was your self improvement. The women came because you were happy and improving. For many, they re-invigorate themselves and focus on self improvement again and become happy. For some, the happiness does not return.

Optional 6.) If you find yourself improving but remaining sad it is likely that the improvement you have laid out for yourself isn‚Äôt what you actually want to improve at. It is those that require a step 6 this post focuses on.

When I was in 8th grade, I was very happy. Why? I had improved from bronze 5 to platinum 5 in league of legends during the year. The happiness did not result from the actual achievement, but rather the journey of improvement. People experience happiness in the 3rd stage not just because they are improving at weight lifting and game, but because they are improving with women. Remember people often come to this sub for the sole reason of improving with women. This is what they wanted to improve and they are seeing the incremental improvement. 

The problem of stage 4 arises because getting women is not a goal that can provide incremental improvement for a long time. After a point, continuing to improve at the majority of goals given on this sub stop improving your ability to get women. For most of those that ascend to step 5, ascend because the goals given on this sub for instance, social confidence and fitness, become what they wish to improve at. 

The majority that fail to ascend, fail because they simply don‚Äôt enjoy those goals as much. Therefore, they miss the lesson of self improvement because they get less satisfaction from the basic goals given to teach this lesson. There are a few that ascend to 5, come to realize they don‚Äôt enjoy lifting and constant social confidence improvement as much as other avenues. These people continue on to step 6, discover what they love to improve at and understand that happiness does not come from a set of instructions given to you, but rather happiness comes from pursuing improvement in what you want. This could be a video game, ceramics, or raising kids. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, fitness and social ability are extremely important to well being, and I am not saying people should not keep the habit of lifting or socializing. Instead, I am saying don‚Äôt expect powerlifting or social mastery to be every persons key to happiness. Also, more importantly, that as long as your are healthy and have friends it doesn‚Äôt matter what you focus on improving. All that matters, is that you want to improve in those areas.",2020-03-29 07:52:25

This conditioning made us believe that somehow women in relationship will behave the same but that's contrary to our experience. Women don't like men who look for their supports ,they want men who are as strong as a stone but meriful to others. 

&#x200B;

There is a subbreddit loveafterporn  where women complained so much that they can't trust their partner no longer because they are struggling with porn and most of them even have hard time trusting their partners again once they know they were watching porn in the relationship or had watched porn previously.  I mean, when it comes to them, we are suppose to forget and forgive every chad/Tyrone they had hooked up with but they are not even to forget images of women we had seen although their feminists sisters encouraged to women to behave like sluts and do porn and when now, its coming and biting them in their asses  but somehow they are saying we are responsible for not controlling our urges. How ironic.

&#x200B;

Don't share your problems with women.ever.  I know there can be exceptions to this but if you had seen those exceptions you had not been on this forum in the first place.

32,Hypergamy as female nature; femininity as social programming,32,0,32,fq70b2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fq70b2/hypergamy_as_female_nature_femininity_as_social/,21,1585375727.0,"**If you're new to THE RED PILL, forgive me if I give you some spoilers- if anything, I'm saying you time- yes, in fact, it's all bullshit.** Everything you've been told, is almost reliably, the opposite of the truth. One key to under standing the world is that *there are no small lies*, minor shifts in approximation or slight exaggerations- no, when lies are told, they are big lies- whoppers, total bullshit, the wool being pulled over your eyes- and **lies are usually the polar opposite of the truth.**

Take what we're told about FEMALE NATURE. We're told that women are naturally sweet, nurturing, understanding; trusting, humble, and submissive- all aspects of [femininity](http://archive.vn/gGQLH) that we're told *come naturally to women as FEMALE NATURE.*

This, my friends and brothers, is a lie- and the polar opposite is true.

Rolling things back to humans as *fancy animals.* Women are dick targets and baby ovens. Men are cum machines and lion killers. Everything on top of this are theatrics for one to attract the other. Anything on top of that are exceptional people doing exceptional things- but on the red pill, we don't concern ourselves with *exceptions to the rule.*

**The rule is that we are animals and we want to fuck...**

...in order to procreate, at least that's where the urge really comes from. And, again, men want the LARGEST NUMBER of women to (theoretically) inseminate and women want to select the BEST MEN to be (again, theoretically) inseminated by...

**Female nature is her quest to find the best men, with the best genetics, to have sex with.** We call this hypergamy, or the female instinct to *trade up*, always on the hunt to find a better mate and produce higher quality children (the latter, of course, is subconscious).

What is the problem here? Allowing this to run rampant, without restriction, will not produce strong societies or coherent civilizations. In other words, you're here, reading this on a smart phone, because of the limits put on human nature/female sexuality (again, dominant men looking to impregnate everything that moves and hypergamous women looking to abandon her prior husband and offspring in the face of a more dominant man)- we call these limits *marriage.*

Suddenly with the bond of marriage (either through the church or through the state, or both)- enforced by a strong social taboo against promiscuity and adultery- women were stuck with the man she chose at a young age, and cads (or, in modern terms, CHADS) had their dicks on a leash. If they wanted to make their marriage a happy and content one, that opportunity was available for them to take. For all the talk about having to do away with the rigid, TILL DEATH, institution of marriage, as it produced *unhappy people*, it was their own fault for not making the most of what they were given rather than faulting the glue we used to hold society together.

But, as it turns out- and as we're seeing now, with aging cat ladies and divorcees loading up on anti-depressants- marriage was actually the best arrangement for long term happiness. And, in order to get both men and women to subdue their inner nature, there needed to be a little bit of *brain trickery*, in the form of social programming and taboos.

**Femininity was a form of social programming.** Convince women to be trusting in her husband, humble in the face of his confidence and masculinity (as leader and head-of-household), and submissive to his leadership. These character traits that she was programmed with, and pressured to adhere to, necessitated that she make a good, long-term choice (a man who is emotionally stable, kind, dependable, etc.) as she would be punished by a poor long term choice. On the flipside, this encouraged men to be good men in order to attract good women, and have a *good marriage.* Everyone was putting their best food forward, or they didn't win the game.

Of course, to the surprise of no one, when feminism became the dominant ideology, they did away with any expectations fostered on women, creating circumstances for hypergamy to run wild, and for marriage (as we knew it) to die, dead as fucking dead. And, guess what bucko, all those social expectations are still placed on men- at least superficially- and **the real heart of our message on THE RED PILL is: the game ended a long time ago, so stop playing by fucking the rules.**

33,"""It's my responsibility"" is a far better phrase, and a far better frame than ""It's my fault""",423,0,423,fpq047,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fpq047/its_my_responsibility_is_a_far_better_phrase_and/,23,1585309326.0,"I keep hearing the term : ""It's always your fault"" all the time, but often it gets misunderstood.

*""My girfriend dumped me / Wife divorced me"" - Your fault.*

*""My parents were abusive to me as a child"" - Your fault. (Seriously WTF? Well unless you are Hindu or Buddhist or some mystic who can find out what you did in your past lives to deserve this...)*

*""I'm wasting my life"" - Your fault (well yes, in this case, it almost always is)*

*""I'm not genetically gifted with a superstar body and looks"" - Your fault*

*""My friend turned to alcohol and drug abuse and died"" - Your fault. (The Hell? I didn't make him drink!)*

*""I lost my job due to the recession"" - Your fault*

Fault is NOT a synonym for responsibility. Fault is explicitly a blame word, used when you have made a mistake, for the purpose of stimulating a feeling of guilt. I don't know who used the word fault in the first place (maybe it was JP?), but he did a crime by substituting the word ""fault"" for ""responsibility"".

In relationships it is a good way of blaming only the man and essentially absolving the woman of any sense of responsibility. Not only does reinforces the lack of empathy for the suffering, it usually just leads to anger and does not resolve the real problems.

A failure to distinguish between fault and responsibility can either lead a man to his awakening, or send him down the slippery slope of toxic shame, guilt and self destruction.

Plus we can always break our head over who's fault it was that caused shit to hit the fan, and hold the offender culpable, but no matter who did it, because it is happening in your life, you will be affected. Dealing with the results of the fallout will inevitably fall on your head and setting things right will be your responsibility. So you'll have to own it regardless of who's fault it was. 

The thing that gets so misunderstood is this -- when it comes to life, we have little control over a lot of things that happen to us. What we DO have control over (if we wake up and see) is the sense of ownership and responsibility - looking at what we can do with what life throws at us.

It can sometimes be a very small window - say just letting yourself spend a few minutes silently being a witness and allowing your thoughts and emotions flow out and dissipate, but it could make the difference between getting up and back on track after a breakup vs a downward spiral of self destruction.

Sometimes it can be a much bigger thing. Look at EVERYTHING that has been created and invented. What did our ancestors have? Nothing. Nothing, but some rocks and trees and animals. Starting from there, all of civilization has been created over time.

Let's just for argument's sake alone, consider that there's something called karma that caused you to land up where you are. But still, karma is not a term to justify you being a victim of fate and things not in your control. What it means is that you got here by what you were once responsible for. Your fate is the result of distant past responsibility and your past choices became your present fate. Karma means that your life has always been your responsibility and it is only awakening your sense of responsibility that can help you dig yourself out of the hole you've dug yourself into.

The term karma if you read it up, has never been used as an excuse to stay a victim who's merely reactive, but ultimately to take responsibility, which leads to a solution to your mess. 

This moment is the only moment where you can be truly responsible for what has happened, what is happening and what is to come. Now is the moment of responsibility. Now is the time to be responsible. 

Responsibility is the quality that allows you to proactively own your life and open the door to creating your life even from virtually nothing.

Being responsible awakens your inner creator and live consciously for once. Being reactive allows you to remain a victim, driven by a clueless subconscious. If anything, this is the ONLY choice you really have. Everything else flows from which frame you choose.

The more you come into the frame of ""It's my responsibility"", the more you get to live a conscious, proactive life of your own making where you find your creative capabilities finding expression.

So next time any of this happens to you, reframe it a little differently, and suddenly many possibilites open up. It is true, that necessity is the mother of invention, but only when you're responsible.

*""My girfriend dumped me / Wife divorced me"" - Your responsiblity. Kick depression, get healthier, get new better relationships.*

*""My parents were abusive to me as a child"" - Your responsibility. Find the tools to overcome your past, come to the present moment, and live truly again. Be the father to your children your parents never were.*

*""I'm wasting my life"" - Your responsibility. This can really be fixed in so many ways.*

*""I'm not genetically gifted with a superstar body and looks"" - Your responsibility. Find out what it takes to improve yourself. You'll soon see that good looks are almost always about a fit body, body language, good style and grooming. How did Joe Decker go from fatass to world's fittest man at one point?*

*""My friend turned to alcohol and drug abuse and died"" - Your responsibility. At least be the rock for his family, or in the long run do something to help people get their shit back on track. I know of one family who started a foundation and a hospital from seeing the death of their loved one.*

*""I lost my job due to the recession"" - Your responsibility. Who knows, you could end up on a new, better career path in a much better place (like me). You might even start your own venture maybe.*

Of course, if you do sit down and honestly look back, you will realize that in many of these situations lots of things were indeed due to your own mistakes and inexperience and you could certainly have done better in hindsight. But many of these lessons aren't learnt without going through the whole experience itself in the first place. However there are also many circumstances that simply aren't under your control either. And other people do exist and have played their own roles in how things turned out, for which they are accountable. 

But FAULT is something different from RESPONSIBILITY. Fault is usually content with blaming yourself (""I'm so bad"") or someone else (""I'm so good) for everything. Neither of the two are realistic. But it is responsibility that allows you to be real, own your life, grow and create from these moments, and inspire others to be responsible in turn.

A lot of us may have lost jobs or started working from home. Luckily everyone is in the same boat, there should be absolutely no complaining about the situation as a man.

I‚Äôve noticed a lot of my beta friends/acquaintances have been lining up for welfare payments (I live in a lucky society where welfare payments in this current crisis are near my part time wage). Instead of using the money on self improvement they are all picking up bags of weed, gaming consoles and other dopamine hits.

Don‚Äôt become one of these people and use covid-19 as an excuse. This is a golden opportunity.

Working out from home is the new standard. Gyms are closed. Learn to enjoy this opportunity to improve your calisthenics skills if you don't own weights. Make sure you are adding weight and volume to your workouts consistently. Come out of quarantine more toned.

Earn income. I know a lot of people that have lost their jobs, but there are still ways to make money online. Now is a great time to begin chipping away at that business you always wanted to quit your job to begin. You need to get ahead of the pack in times like this. You can‚Äôt even be spinning plates during quarantine, so you have no excuses.

Invest. Asset prices are lower than they ever have been in recent memory, there is probably (definitely) more downside over the coming months. Now is the time to start dollar cost averaging and putting money in. Remember the central banks will shower more cash on the world economy, only furthering asset prices in the future when the quarantine is over and employment resumes.

Initiate a side hustle. The internet has so many opportunities to create revenue, turn your passion into a business to never work a day in your life. Even if you have a job, you need to be diversifying your income streams.

Hobbies. Follow your passions, girls don‚Äôt care what your passion is. Just have at least one. Bonus points for cool hobbies with the ladies.

Learn a language. It‚Äôs such a large goal, if you actually commit it will do plenty for your self motivation, goal setting, opportunities. memory and long term thinking skills.

Bonus: I went to Buenos Aires, Argentina last year and I was amazed with the quality of women there. I will admit I was staying in the rich area, but the men are so beta over there that it was easy to consistently score 8‚Äôs and 9‚Äôs. Learning the language would make these girls even easier as I was talking English on dates.

Don‚Äôt be wasting time on dating apps. Keep DMing girls on instagram to a low, always aim to be ignoring their DMs. Don‚Äôt invest time in being a girl's boredom killer, she will branch swing to the next best alpha when the quarantine is over and forget your emotional/boredom support during covid-19.

What I‚Äôm going to be doing:

* Learning Spanish
* Training hard
* Keeping my six pack
* Not drinking alcohol (I‚Äôll save it for the crazy parties after lockdown ends)
* Working my part time job (Part time for work life balance)
* Creating digital products
* Learning to produce music
* Delete dating apps and ghost girls for mystery and efficiency
* No Fap
* Automating my job using Python.
* Keeping in strong contact with my bros.

If you don‚Äôt waste the next period, you will be launched back to reality with a new rhythm. You should have hobbies, be in great shape and have more money ready to cash in on how horny girls will be after the lockdown ends. Don‚Äôt become a loser and start smoking weed and playing games. Become a man. Self improve.",2020-03-26 17:40:31

Joined maybe 6-8 months ago. I remember reading something, somewhere here, about the need to move on from your mother, as she is your first love as a boy (male). As I have been absorbing the gold lined pages of wisdom from the many of you veterans here, I have begun to filter my entire world through a red lens. I see the light! What I would like to focus on, is how simply absorbing, analyzing and meditating on vital information can change your actions. Slowly, but it all starts with a thought.

I grew up in a soviet immigrant family. I was born in the states, but my parents came out of the USSR in the very late 80's. They started with nothing and now have the american dream, somewhat. My dad is typical alpha male, and my mom, he probably married her because shes a fantastic house wife. But her brain, even though growing up in a completely different culture, was exactly the same as you would find in the west. I always thought my mom is different. If I could find a woman like that I would marry her in a heart beat. But alas, after going red pill, I have realized how many flaws my mother has. Yes she is an absolutely fantastic cooking and cleaning machine, those are simply learned, step by step skills that I have also learned. 

Yes I live with my parents, and even pay rent. No one really asks what I do, where I go. This is helping me save for a proper place of my own. It used to be that my dad would punish me for half assed work, low effort, lack of attention to detail. He would always be mad at me when I couldn't figure something out on my own or handle a family matter when he isn't there at the time. This constant pressure has forced me to adapt. Making split second decisions, handling important matters that matter to he family as a whole is a non issue. Him and me work in tandem, hand in hand. Without my mother knowing he has changed the ownership of the house from Him to Him and Me. I have shed blood and sweat for the family (literally). There is a lot of responsibility handling this wealth that he has managed to accumulate, and I treat everything as my own and he treats everything as mine.

So where is the mom section you ask?

Well, my mom still see's me as her little boy, her son, her errand boy. My sister who is now 20, has completely westernized my mom. When I talk to my mom I realize, being a stay at home mom and having only my sister as a female friend for 90% of her married life, has kept her mind at the level of a 20 year old girl who doesn't have a care in the world about anything other than marriage, making babies and looking pretty. Yes she can handle her own in this life because as me and my sister were growing up, she stayed at home and handled things, but over time responsibilities shifted to me. Thanks to technology and mobile phone addiction (which I have uprooted from my life thanks to trp) her attention span is 0 and the amount of misinformation she consumes is enormous.

I have found myself frequently having to put my foot down on her and my sister, take matters into my own hands, but my mother who still does not understand I am a full grown red pilled man, that she should listen to me instead of argue and claim disrespect. I do not mean disrespect, it is her family and her household, but AWALT takes its toll. She can't use logic, she can't think on her feet, she lacks experience in using technology in a useful manner, she doesn't understand western culture outside of the 80's and 90's and how things have changed.

Due to the harsh times upon us thanks to COVID-19, my father and I have decided to up security measures around the property, stock up on various foods, grains, plant seeds, etc. Thing is, unlike my sister who is home from school, and my mother whose part time job let her go, my father and I are still working full time, and will not be sent home. Picking up supplies, doing online research, preparing for the worst is hard to do when you are already pretty busy. This is where the cracks show. Depending on delegation is no longer working and we had a huge fight between my dad and I, and the women in my house. I understand, men can handle a lot more than women, and can do more, period. But this has nothing to do with the topic. It all came down to my mom trying to throw me under the bus claiming I am irresponsible, that I should carry more of the load. I simply walked away, and let my father put her in her place. I was done arguing about it. I am not her errand boy, I am her future life line if anything is to happen to my father, and I will be the head of the family just as he was, and I answer for my actions in front of the family and the results will speak for themselves. She can doubt me, she can throw me under the bus, she can try to side track me from my goals, but it will have no effect as I only answer to other men.

TL;DR

At one point you grow out of being your moma's boy, her errand boy, her whatever boy. You answer to yourself, to other men even, but not her. She has done her job in feeding you and hopefully you had a father to raise you. I know you love her, but she will always keep you down.

When an activity sucks replace it with something else but always do your time.

From all the material I've read and listened to it seems that consistency is the theme in every self-improvement tactic. Except that you've no fucking idea what to be consistent at because everyone's situation is so different. Your grandma wants you to meditate more. Your gym buddies want you to lift more. Your high-effort school buddies are telling you to learn to code. Joe Rogan is telling you to do martial arts. This is way too much conflicting information and too much pressure. You're probably going to become obsessed by 1 thing, like lifting --- when that habit stops bringing payoffs due to injury or depression, you're lost. And why not, how could only 1 thing be the solution to everything?

tl-dr;

The body and mind have needs that should be regularly tended to.  There are many, some knowns and some unknowns. Fill your hour with a mix of things that will tick different boxes. Always question if your routine could be improved and tweaked. Never questions if your routine has value. What could be more important than setting the tone for the day, and setting levers in their correct positions, daily?

* *I was abused as a child.* **Don‚Äôt Care. It‚Äôs Your Fault.**
* *I‚Äôm not tall/good looking/smart/some other genetic trait, enough.* **Don‚Äôt Care. It‚Äôs Your Fault.**

This is a hard truth for some people to swallow. But here‚Äôs the secret, it has nothing to do with accepting or assigning blame. Blame is for losers. Blame is used to shirk and skip out on responsibility. Blame is a tool for blue pill faggots.

**Responsibility is a tool for winners.**

---

Let‚Äôs take a look at a real life scenario that could happen to any one of us.

You are walking down the street one evening in your city's downtown area on the way to a date. Since you are in a time crunch you cut down an alleyway to save a few minutes. As you are walking you get an uneasy feeling in your gut. You can‚Äôt place it, but something feels off.

Moving past a dumpster you see movement out of your peripheral vision and before you can identify it, the words, ‚Äú*Give me your wallet, phone and watch,*‚Äù  register in your ears. While instinctively turning towards the sound you feel a sharp pain in your side and when looking down see the knife blade being pulled from your gut. Falling to the ground you think to yourself, ‚ÄúHow did this happen?‚Äù

Rule #1 says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs your fault.‚Äù

---

*But I didn‚Äôt stab myself. I was just walking downtown. It‚Äôs a safe city. It was just bad luck.*

Sure, that is one way to look at it. Bad luck. But I don‚Äôt believe in luck. I believe we, through our intentional and unintentional actions, influence the world around us. We are the masters of our own destiny. By simply writing things off as bad luck or circumstance or **victim mentality** we are absolving ourselves of the **responsibility** to live our own lives.

In the above scenario are you an actual victim of a crime? Absolutely. Is the criminal to blame for your wounds? Of course. But who holds the responsibility for your life and the choices you made to put yourself there? Only you.

Did you have to be late and therefore choose to walk that way to save time? **No**. Could you have been more situationally aware and listen to your intuition? **Yes**. Even barring those was there a more advantageous outcome once engaged by the thief? **Of course**.

Let‚Äôs say you were Concealed Carrying (assuming it‚Äôs legal in your jurisdiction) and had enough situational awareness to notice the attacker before they were close enough to stab you. They still demand your money and with a knife in hand start to move towards you. You draw and shoot them.

Rule #1 It‚Äôs your fault.

(Disclaimer: This is a good scenario because it shows an important distinction between taking personal responsibility for your life, and legal or some other liability for your actions. I don‚Äôt ever want this rule to be construed as advice to take liability. It‚Äôs just about accepting the fact you are not a victim. It‚Äôs your fault. Own it personally, but in the above scenario shut up and ask for a lawyer.)

---

Why is it so important to take personal responsibility for your life?

If you spend your time trying to find and place blame, rather than just saying, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my fault.‚Äù You will never be able to spend your time finding solutions and improving. If you write off the scenario above as bad luck, then you don‚Äôt learn how to avoid the situation to begin with.

When your girl cheats on you and you say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs her fault for doing that.‚Äù You are technically correct and you should 1000% hold her responsible for her behaviour. But what did you do that led up to that. Things do not occur in a vacuum. Maybe you can evaluate the situation and come to the conclusion that you had no hand in anything leading up to it. But most likely not.

The other important reason for taking responsibility in your life is your own happiness.

When I get mad at people for things they do, I allow them to influence my happiness. If I look at every situation in life and ask, ‚ÄúHow is this my fault?‚Äù I have much more control over outcomes and emotions about the situation. My happiness is no longer defined by others actions. I won‚Äôt be angry or upset about things that happen to me because I‚Äôm learning to own **my** life and **my** feelings.

Stop giving other people and life events power over your happiness and life. Take responsibility. Own your own life.

Over the years my syntax and diction has improved a lot. I‚Äôve also developed a more seasoned arsenal of rebuttals that have led to some enjoyable banter with both men and women.

I honestly believe this all started when I was a teenager, back in the day when I inhaled more weed smoke than air. **My boys and I would freestyle all the damn time.** Even though we stopped smoking weed, we never stopped freestyling.

I genuinely think freestyling gave me more ‚Äúconversational confidence‚Äù. It gave me the ability to start saying something without knowing where it would lead to. Which is what you want when hitting on a girl, you want it to sound unrehearsed. 

It‚Äôs like drano for your thoughts, you get confident with how your voice sounds, you improve the pace of your word output and learn the rhythm that pairs best with your thought flow. I learned I‚Äôm better slow, with a sprinkle of speed here and there.

This borrows some ideas from some recent posts, in my own original form and based on my own experiences. 

Female solipsism and narcissism. A concern only with how she is perceived socially. Her social appearance and the feelings which it provides are her driving force.

2 things...avoidance of blame and responsibility.

With bad behavior. Her default setting is that she is incapable of seeing the world through your eyes objectively. She is not interested in seeing her actions through your eyes. Or how it affects you.

She is only concerned with her social perception, and how that makes her feel.

She acts up. I could not say 'that was shitty, covert, secretive behavior'...and have her agree. 'yea, you're right'.

She is only concerned with protecting how she is perceived and how that makes her feel. How she can rationalize her own behavior away. Even if it contradicts reality.

She will say 'no, that isn't me' and 'don't make me feel bad'. 'I am not responsible'. The only thing that matters is what she sees through HER eyes. And her eyes will try to see her in the best light possible. Protect the feelz.

Secondly. In a greater sense, this leads to one of their ultimate operating programs.

They are driven by SOCIAL PERCEPTION. Over objective truth. If they can convince enough people they are a certain way, then it becomes the truth.¬†

Even if the truth of who they are, or their behavior is contrary. Social perception is more important than cold, hard, objective truths.¬†

They deal with people, not cold hard facts. If they can convince enough people they are a certain way, then it becomes truth. Even if it is incongruent with their actions.¬†

To many, social perception is so intoxicating, it can lead to a blinding lack of responsibility in their own lives. They will do anything, fuck whoever, behave however. But if in the minds of people she is seen as a 'good girl', it wipes out anything she does. That's all just 'feelz'. 'Enough people think I am good, so I am good'.

This is because many women, since girlhood, were taught that social perception is how they will survive. Boys were given things, taught skills, learned truths, to lead and taught that their ability to work and create is how they will survive. That is our value.

For women, it is how they are seen by others. Women were given make-up, beauty tips, told to be beautiful and ATTRACT THE GREATEST SUITOR. How they are perceived creates their truth and value.

They will gladly and unconsciously wipe out a history of incongruent behavior if they can convince enough people they are a 'good girl'. If others perceive it, and she feels it, it is 'true'.

How to tackle this, is firstly how you protect yourself. Listen to the stories and images she portrays. Know it doesn't necessarily signal objective and substantial truth. It's what she wants you to PERCEIVE. If she can convince you to perceive it and FEEL like she is that person, she is that person. Her measure of whether that is truly her is not on objective behavior, traits, and action. It is her ability to CONVINCE others to PERCEIVE her that way. It's up to you to decipher the distance from reality to desired perception. 

Watch what they do. Don't pedestalize. Watch for inconsistencies and lack of substantial objective truth to back up her stories. Words, images, and story without substantial proof is manipulation. Don't buy in right away. Especially if you don't see proof that what she says is what she is.¬†

Towards her. Always keep her on her toes. Always subtly hint that you don't buy into her bullshit. Amused Mastery. You're unaffected because you don't CARE what she is or does. But you're still the mighty authority, dropping hints that you see the holes. Tease her like a five-year-old girl who says 'this is who I aaamm', and believes how much she plays the part means she is the part. Cute, isn't it. She's a good little actress.

Always subtly play at her 'image'. If social perception is how she survives, you are the one who perceives who she really is. 'It's ok cutie, you can be the bad girl you really are with me, and I'll tell the world you're oh so good'.

You are a higher status, the authority. She needs your perception of her. If she can manipulate it, she's won. Drop hints that she can't. Tap and tease and pull at her frame. Not enough to show you care, but enough to show she's not winning or fooling the man of status and worth like the beta boys.

(getting women is only a marker for success on the mission, not the mission in itself)",191,0,191,fnn54p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fnn54p/say_all_the_women_in_the_world_were_wiped_out/,64,1585010719.0,"**It's probably my own fault for not being clear enough**, but it seems as though the prevailing misinterpretation of my last [post](http://archive.is/1nuYm) on understanding the FOUNDATION of ""masculinity is winning, and winning is power,"" is that getting women is the only marker for this, and this, getting women is the masculine mission. THIS IS NOT CORRECT.

**This reminds me of a story I told in the very first entry of my blog ([KTP](https://killtoparty.com/))**, where I was racking up female friends as an awkward, goofy fifteen-year-old and being such a good little *boy friend* (two words) that they'd pass their friend's phone numbers to me, in an age before AIM even (if you're too young to know what AIM is, think: texting with computers)- and I thought I was on my way to getting a *girlfriend* (one word). I'd spend hours upon hours on the phone with them (thinking MORE me is BETTER me and more EFFECTIVE me), making chitchat, and gossiping, and... well, whatever they'd want to talk about (to use the lingo, not just falling into, but *existing soley* in their frame).

Until one day, my father sat me down and told me that none of these girls were ever going to be my girlfriend.. and I was shocked, and angry, and *embarrassed*, and I'm sure I reacted like an ungrateful asshole but... I knew he was right.

**The mistake most teenagers make: I made getting girls the mission**, and then I'd be confused when they'd date boys who gave them less attention, and instead worked on their cars, and had cool jobs, and played sports, and had bands... had missions outside of spending all their time being a *boy friend* (yup, two words).

**Women cannot be the masculine mission**. Yes, it is totally valid to be a GENUINE voluntary celibate, the key word being GENUINE- and only you can be honest with yourself if you choose this path. But understand that you've then taken yourself out of the game, so of course women cannot be a marker of success...

But, if the game is what you're playing, it's naive to say that attracting women isn't a marker of success. Think of it like a litmus test- **WOMEN ARE A MARKER OF SUCCESS FOR A MAN.** It doesn't have to be your end goal, or your purpose in life (and, let's be real, unless you want a family, women are just a fancier means of masturbation). But, just like waking up with a roaring hard-on is an informal, but still darn good, marker for masculine health and wellness, GETTING WOMEN IS A MARKER FOR SUCCESS- a symptom, a gauge, a little bit of real-world feedback.

Remember, women are naturally attracted to the most genuinely, overall successful (physically attractive, socially adept, interesting, mysterious, etc. etc.)- they may fake attraction to a *overall* unsuccessful man with resource- but, again, **if you wanted a real-world, real-time gauge on your success, the number of women you can attract is a good marker for this.**

...and to answer the question in the subject field.. if there were no women left on Earth, success and power would be defined by whomever is winning (biggest castle? most weapons? who the fuck knows...).",2020-03-24 00:45:19

My fellow Men -

By nature we negotiate. We negotiate business deals, car purchases, home purchases, cellphone plans, if there is an angle for negotiation, we naturally jump on the opportunity to bargain. When the goal is simple, and the payouts low, most here will resort to base tactics, attempting to emotionally justify, that 'everyone wins'. I used to sell cars, it was confusing when customers happily agreed to the midpoint of our price difference as we salesman knew we'd be working from the midpoint down. 

Negotiations, in general, are about reconciling differences in a thoughtful, intelligent manner. Usually a checklist of must haves, ok having, and not ok having. We work with fellow Men and their lawyers & try to predict future issues, often setting up clear guidelines in how to deal with them in advance. If you've ever seen a purchase & sale agreement of a business, or even boilerplate home sales, behind the scenes were series of Negotiations.

So when your plate, FWB, LTR, Wife, comes to you with issues, whether logical or completely emotional, the **fool** responds by turning on his natural base negotiation tactics. 

Do I look pretty in this yellow dress? *Responds honestly*

You should cuss less. *Goes into scientific mode & responds how cussing is a sign of trust*

**Can we take a break?** *Why? Did I do something wrong? I'll be better, I promise. I'll try.*

My fellow Men -

You cannot negotiate feelings. You can only manipulate them. Don't resort to Man-speak, where words & facts are your sword and shield - useless, in the presence of the Feminine. Target & work with the underlying feelings. No negotiation

48,**One Key Step To Not Giving a Fuck (Sidebar Post)**,620,0,620,fmi710,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fmi710/one_key_step_to_not_giving_a_fuck_sidebar_post/,59,1584839065.0,"I found TRP 5 years ago while Google-searching ‚ÄúHow to get out of the friendzone‚Äù. Thankfully, one of the Google search results led me to TRP where I read post after post after post; alongside articles from Rollo Tomassi‚Äôs *The Rationale Male.*


During my first four months of finding TRP I literally read TRP all day long, day after day. I read through TRP posts as if I was studying for an examination. I particularly enjoyed the comments section, they were pure gold those day. You got even more revelation from the comments than from the main posts.  I read TRP so much that my eyes began to hurt ‚Äì literally and figuratively (‚ÄúWhy do my eyes hurt?‚Äù ‚Äì Neo).


However there was one theme I kept reading over and over, yet couldn‚Äôt internalize: **How to Stop Giving a Fuck.** I won‚Äôt forget that day I clicked on a Sidebar Article which had been posted a few months before I found TRP ‚Äì **One Key Step to Not Giving a Fuck** (Originally, **The Guide to Accepting Yourself Even When Women Don‚Äôt**). The poster deleted his account shortly afterwards. May the soul of his account rest in perfect peace.


That post changed my life forever. I later realized that learning to accept myself and not to give a fuck about many things is key to developing many other traits such as Frame, Abundance, etc. The post is on the sidebar, but throughout my 5 years on TRP, I have never seen anyone refer to it either in a post or a comment; hence this post. I‚Äôll paste the original post here:


> Recently someone here posted about how women define ""average"" in astronomical terms, based on some bullshit a girl said while shit testing him. Most of the responses didn't understand that he was being tested because most of the commenters aren't ok with themselves at all.


> **Quick Method**


> Know all those dating apps and sites you use? Know how you like to finely craft introductions designed to make the woman see you in a favorable light?


> Don't do that.


>Send any one of these messages that say, ""I love me and I don't care if you do.""


> 1 - ""Boners.""


> 2 - ""Super boners.""


> 3 - ""I'm going to be playing video games all week but you can come over this weekend and do my laundry.""


> 4 - ""Do you ever get those crusties in your asshole and pick them out in the shower?""


> 5 - ""Want to help me practice for my driver's exam? The police said I can finally get my license.""

> These messages are not meant to get you a woman. The responses you receive (you will get responses) will show you how much better this type of ""who really fucking cares right?"" attitude matches up against, ""Oh god oh god oh god I'd better say the right thing.""


> And that leads us to today's lesson:


> **You don't matter that much.**


>Sorry, but if the fate of the world rested on your shoulders we'd all be fucked. You're reading how-to guides about becoming ok with yourself. So really you don't matter that fucking much.


>And that's fine! That's preferable. It takes pressure off your shoulders. You can walk into a bar and tell a girl that you're a martian whose pants will explode at midnight unless an earth girl removes them with her teeth. Guess what? No one will care! Tomorrow CNN will run a headline about ISIS feeding babies to elephants and your pickup line will become just another blip in the endless history of the universe.


> Corollary - Women will try to make you think that you **should matter a whole lot.** They'll tease you and ask you why you're not a buff macho kingpin or why you don't own 10 businesses and a thousand dogs. The important thing to notice here is:
*That's what they say, not what they think.*


>Most women wouldn't give ten shits about your income or dog breeding knowledge if you are ok enough with yourself to show them a good time. Confidence does not come to you by knowing that you're big stuff and that you're a huge valuable part of society. If it did, hardly anyone would be confident because hardly anyone actually matters that much.


>Confidence comes with knowing that you don't matter that much and that other people really don't either, women included. So if it's not that big of a deal, what do you have to lose?


>Nothing.

> **Little people often have big pride.**


>It helps them not feel little. It's a defense mechanism. Being defensive is itself a small and impotent thing to do.


>Pride weighs a lot. It's one of the biggest forms of baggage and some of you have been feeling it in your chest for years without realizing it. It comes in the form of thoughts like, ""What am I going to be doing a year from now? Two years from now? If all my dreams aren't coming true, I'm a worthless piece of shit.""


> Or, ""I need the perfect body, most money, and biggest adventures or I'll be a drain on humanity, just another turd in the bucket.""


> Or, ""If I don't bang every hot chick and turn into a fuck stud of epic proportions, I'm just another waste of space.""


> Guess what?


> People who don't care if they get ass...get more ass than you.


>People with shitty bodies who don't give a fuck...get more ass than you.


>People who have zero ambition and are ok with that...get more ass than you.


> **If it is truly your ambition in life to become something great, then you will follow that ambition no matter what.** You won't dither about it. You won't get confused and wonder if you're doing the right thing. You definitely won't beat yourself up about not doing it.


> So if you're an ambitionless ham planet and you absolutely love your life, there's no reason to qualify yourself to women ever.
If you're a healthy cut millionaire and you hate your life, well I can't help you with that. .0001% problems.


> So make a list of the shit you love about yourself that women would call ""immature"" or ""irresponsible"" and then realize that shit is all in your head. Almost anything you do (short of rape and murder) can be awesome and praiseworthy if you love doing it and you're solid about that to the core.


> Women will prod at you all day and shit test, saying, ""Well a mature real man is like this,"" or, ""I can only be with a man who blah blah blah."" If you aren't ok with yourself, you'll cave to this type of bullshit instantly. If you're fully ok with yourself, you'll laugh it off and continue on being you.


> **Remember this:**


> There are no rules for life other than eat, sleep, breathe, and survive. The rest is completely made up. Clothes? Optional. Words? Optional. Bathing? Optional. Dating? Made up. Relationship standards? Fiction. Breeding? Unnecessary.


> You could wake up tomorrow and pretend you're an African prince who has to drive backwards to work or else the mafia will come and steal your asshole. And that would make only marginally less sense than people driving to the same workplace every day to get money to pay for a piece of the planet they were born on which can be taken away by a group of people in a big building with giant metal rooms full of green paper.


> So you don't matter that much and life is ridiculous. You couldn't possibly make life any more ridiculous than it already is. So don't go around acting like every little action matters.


> Accept yourself.

49,"Masculinity is winning, and winning is power",240,0,240,fmhzor,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fmhzor/masculinity_is_winning_and_winning_is_power/,60,1584838335.0,"**It was a few months ago when a big, burly man with a beard- whom, I believe runs a lifting podcast- had a viral video shouting about masculinity.** In response to the [bugman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cetg4gu0oQQ)/[corporate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0) alliance to redefine masculinity as weakness and submission- masculinity, as he put it, cannot be redefined and is only what it has been in the traditional sense: brute strength, the ability to confront and defend, and a willingness to fight to the death- if necessary. And while he isn't *necessarily wrong*, he isn't telling the full story... so let's start at the very beginning: 

**Masculinity is power**

He's right that the most visceral and immediately obvious form of power is in physical force and muscular aesthetic. Walk into a room and get heads to turn, often getting silently assigned the leadership position in any group you're part of (AMOG) based solely on appearances- because, yes, we judge books by their covers because this is *far more often than not* totally correct. The world can be highly predictable through genetics and physiognomy.

But what are men to do who are under six feet tall, and have less than admirable physical appearances (yes, I hear you yelling ""LIFT,"" let's put that aside temporarily)- men who are less than the obvious genetic alpha male, who aren't going to admit sexual market place defeat, will need to find a different route to power... so, now let's expand our definition of masculinity to include these men who have found alternate routes to power:

**Masculinity is winning, and winning is power**

Thinking back to the very foundation of the red pill- the evolutionary foundation of the red pill- men are programmed to want to impregnate (fuck) as many women as they can. This will calm the nerves of your pre-programmed, biological anxiety (sex drive)- this is why we discourage too much jacking off and certainly no porn, which serve as an artificial means of quelling this anxiety; we WANT you to be anxious, and use that anxiety to drive you to success (fucking as many women as you'd like).

So, in wanting to fuck *all the women*, men must compete with one another- and if we define success as *fucking as many women as one would like*, which is inarguable POWER (not money- no one wants to be a dickless billionaire), **masculinity must be defined as winning this game by any means necessary.**

Back to those bugmen who make YouTube videos attempting to redefine masculinity- it may not be admirable, but they're only trying (ok, and failing) to win the game the only way they can.

How about this: is the I DON'T GIVE A FUCK drug dealer masculine, even if he's 120 pounds and addicted to heroin? If he's winning and getting pussy, why not?

Now, of course, your life shouldn't be bought and sold on getting pussy alone- even if the drug dealer is winning temporarily, this isn't sustainable as the kind of healthy habits the burly man was yelling about, but to say this kind of *live for today,* carpe diem philosophy isn't masculine because it doesn't include raw power and muscle isn't quite the case either- it's just not terribly smart.

When we consider the behavior of the WHITE KNIGHT, we see him as unconsciously realizing that he cannot compete (and win) against men who are naturally good with women, he attempts to win by disqualification by displaying to the woman that, while he may not be the cool guy or the hot guy, his advantage is being *the respectful guy.* Of course, we're too smart to think this (ever) works- but again, the idea is to redefine the masculine as respect in order to win the game and grasp power.

When we think about GAME- what game is and why it's effective- we can conclude that game is signaling social attributes that *disqualify the competition*. For example, if other men shower you with praise and complements, I will tease you to demonstrate that I am *not impressed by your beauty and facade*- I've been with girls who are prettier, and therefore are pre-selected and of higher-value than those other non-masculine men. **A win by disqualification is still a win if the end product is the same.**  

**Winning the competition is masculinity and losing the competition is not.** Now get out there and FUCKING WIN.

50,Game will never die (understanding what game is and why it works),244,0,244,flm3xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/flm3xk/game_will_never_die_understanding_what_game_is/,90,1584696437.0,"**It always gets me when semi-manosphere bloggers half-kiddingly will say that game is dead**- because more men are game aware, and competition is fierce. This has everything to do with the promiscuity market fully over-taking the relationship market, as fewer women feel a pressing need to have a relationship and are more open to long periods of being single and ""dating"" (commonly refered to as ""hook-up culture"").

In short, **game isnt dead** but anything less than top-shelf game is a waste of time. No longer do you have a lifebar, this is *one hit kill* territory. Think of it like this, just being a guy concerned with fitness twenty years ago would be a gold star in your favor- now it's a pre-requisite for entry (and don't expect to actually impress a woman with your physique unless you're in the legit top 10% of your gym).

So let's start with the very basics, **what is game and why does it work?**

First, a quick reminder of biology- from an evolutionary, human-as-animal perspective: men want to impregnate (fuck) as many women as possible and women only want to get impregnated (fucked) by the highest quality of mate. This is why you could see a girl on the side of the road with big tits in a tight tank top and know, for certain, that you'd fuck her in the three seconds you glance at her in passing... a woman will make that same snap judgment (gut-instinct, or ""female intuition""), but for the opposite purpose- as a means of sifting through and disqualifying potential mates efficiently.

**Game is a means of hacking her unconscious disqualification system**- *unconscious* because she knows what excites her (Chad) and what she's disgusted by (bottom 80% of men); this is something that happens in her brain, at all times, like software running in the background. Proper use of game is meant to make her take pause and *consciously* doubt the accuracy of this system.

For example, if she initially perceives you as a beta, and assumes you have stereotypical beta qualities: humble, nice, desperate for validation and attention, uncool social skills, shy, insecure, impressed by her beauty- when you display the polar opposite of these attributes, in a manner that is bold and captivating, she will *temporarily* reassess her unconscious appraisal.

**Negging, or teasing a woman, is the most common and timeless methods of game and should be in anyone repertoire.** When you tease a woman, you're extinguishing several of the aforementioned beta traits in combination, depending on the particular neg: you aren't very impressed by her (implying that you are used to her degree of beauty), youi do have cool social skills, you're confident and outcome independent- if she's not cool enough to get the joke, she could take a walk. You're the opposite of every guy falling all over her, you have good genetics, and are worth mating with.

Of course game only works temporarily- after all, this is a hack. It must be continued indefinitely, even if only intermittently (in LTR), in order for her unconscious to not override her doubts- in which case, she'll begin to lose attraction and interest in you until the relationship is completely over. This is very likely the end of every relationship you've had.

**Do all men need game?** Yes and no. All men can certainly use game, but the true necessity of game depends on the value discrepancy between man and woman. If a male 09 is interested in a female 06, he likely have a pass to behave however he wants- if he wants to date a female 08, he'll need game.

51,She hates you for committing to her,607,0,607,fl7jab,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fl7jab/she_hates_you_for_committing_to_her/,150,1584640741.0,"A neverending dilemma that most in the BP world deal with is the sudden and unexplained shift in the women they marry. What happened to that angelic woman who wanted sex five times a day and treated you like a king? Well, for starters, she never existed. Instead, more likely, she did the bare minimum that the beta she was plying her wares on magnified in his mind because he has such a limited experience of what women are willing to do with, to and for a man they invested in. Secondly, and more critically, is the paradox of commitment: she despises the man for giving it to her.

It makes no sense on the surface. A man committing his time, energy, resources to one woman for the rest of his life is something that is celebrated and encouraged of all of us from the time we're old enough to be indoctrinated. Surely every woman's dream is to have the man she loves do this for her, correct? Why, then, would she despise the chump who saves up for six months, buys a nice shiny rock, gets on one knee and proceeds to spend a small fortune on one day? If you know female nature, especially the hyper nature it has taken over the past 60 years, then you likely know the answer.

See, the woman in this scenario, and every other woman in existence, knows an immutable truth. This truth is that the man is not committing to who he thinks he's marrying. Instead, he's marrying an idealised version presented to him by careful charms and illusions and cemented by his own pre-programmed beliefs. The real her is a dirty little slag who wants to sleep with as many hot guys as possible and extract commitment from one of *them*. The real her wants to have consequence-free sex and hop from one guy to the next until she finds the best amongst them she can extract marriage from. The real her doesn't want to be tied down to any particular alpha, but to sample as many as time will allow before deciding who will marry her. The only problem? Well, she can certainly get these guys to sleep with her, but very few are willing to stick around. And thus, her dual drives must compete and find a victor, and because she has a limited window where she is viable to the largest portion of men, she must eventually accept that the beta is the best she can do. Except, she doesn't. Not really.

See, women cannot reconcile a direct causality between the choices they made in their younger years with where they are romantically. She can't admit that her blatant whoring led to unrealistic valuations of her own place in the SMP, or that the distinct lack of viable, steady LTRs left her crippled and unable to maintain relationships through the inevitable lulls. Instead, she blames the man. If he wasn't such a chump, she'd undoubtdly be happier. And this is true, to the extent that betas are awful mates who can't provide the rocksteady foundations that women need, nor the firm hand they desire. But even beyond this, she wouldn't be happy because the problem goes much deeper than the chump she's with. The core is that she knows that she is not worthy of commitment.

You know that old joke about not wanting to be a member of any club that would have you? Women operate in that way. Because she knows herself and her several inadequacies, she can't help but look down on the fool who actually commits himself to her. She knows she's not worthy of commitment by any self-respecting man. She built up a facade that anyone with keen eyes can see through, and the fact that the man who commits to her cannot see through this glamour inevitably leads to her labeling him as unworthy. Because any man who can't see though her is worthless, because what experienced prospector mistakes copper for gold?",2020-03-19 17:59:01
52,Do NOT underestimate the dangers of rationalization -- 6 tips to help you achieve your goals.,332,0,332,fkxz2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fkxz2z/do_not_underestimate_the_dangers_of/,22,1584597129.0,"#Introduction 

This virus shit is getting out of hand. Many of you are going to use this time to get weak as fuck and rationalize breaking your discipline. Don't. Stay strong and heed my advice. Although I wrote this as a chapter for my book, I figured I'd share it with the community that inspired me to get my shit together in the first place. 

Godspeed.





#1 Get Rid of Your Victim Mentality.


I have seen people with one leg running marathons using a prosthetic leg. 

I have seen people with no arms in the gym doing leg presses. 

I have seen people with stumps for legs (seated) overhead pressing 225 like it‚Äôs nothing. 


Even if you can‚Äôt move physically (at all) you can get strong mentally. Go read. Stephen Hawking couldn‚Äôt bench 225 but he could solve the puzzles of the fucking universe. Hell, even Helen Keller made use of herself and couldn't see or hear.
 
**The only excuses you have for weakness and mediocrity are rationalizations that are full of shit and have no ground in reality if you have an ounce of will.**

Practically everybody that‚Äôs lacking strength is rationalizing their weakness through a shit ton of means instead of looking in the mirror and seeing themselves for what they are; complacent spineless cowards who need to get their lives together.  

‚ÄúOh, I can‚Äôt lose weight‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm naturally fat.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOh, I can‚Äôt gain weight‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm naturally skinny‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe universe hates me.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI just have bad luck.‚Äù 

‚ÄúMercury is in retrograde.‚Äù 

All of this smells like bitch to me. It‚Äôs amazing how far people will go to justify being mediocre. The purpose of this post is to talk a little bit about rationalizations and the nature of weakness so you can get your shit together and become the greatest possible version of yourself.

#2 Understand Why We Rationalizatize.


Rationalizations are born out of a need to justify bad decisions and/or weakness.

Got drunk after you said you‚Äôd quit drinking again? 

*‚ÄúOh well, I had a rough week. I needed SOMETHING.‚Äù*

Went back to your shitty ex-girlfriend because you were horny? 

*‚ÄúI had to get this nut off somehow. She isn‚Äôt so bad‚Ä¶‚Äù*

Cheating on your diet? 

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just ONE donut‚Ä¶ and besides, I earned it.‚Äù* 

You get the point. Rationalizations ‚Äújustify‚Äù bad decisions, lack of dedication, and weakness of will.

The next question is how exactly do we spot rationalizations and nip them in the bud before they end up manifesting itself as a weakness? 

There are two types of rationalizations. 

* Before the act.

* After the act.


#3 Don't fall for Before the Act Rationalizations.


Before the act rationalizations are really simple. When you‚Äôre about to do something you know you shouldn‚Äôt do you begin thinking of reasons why you should.

‚ÄúI worked hard on my last gym session‚Ä¶ I can miss one, it won‚Äôt hurt.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeling really lonely‚Ä¶ maybe she‚Äôs changed.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to do *x* today, I can just do it tomorrow and I‚Äôll be fine. Besides, I deserve a break.‚Äù

I needn‚Äôt go on. 

This just takes will and self-control. Notice the rationalization and don‚Äôt fall for it. There‚Äôs no special trick; just don‚Äôt fall for it and stay focused on your goal.

#4 How to Stop After the Act Rationalizations.


Rationalizations after the fact are dangerous. They justify being a failure and acting all high and mighty when you really ain‚Äôt shit. You already fucked up. The only thing you can do now is get back on the horse but know it‚Äôs going to be harder than when you first started. When you do something wrong and rationalize it afterward instead of berating and punishing yourself as you should be, you‚Äôre telling yourself it‚Äôs okay to fail and be an inferior human being. 

It‚Äôs not okay to fail. Anybody who tells you otherwise is a loser themselves. When you fail you should get angry, you should be pissed, whoever is graceful in defeat is destined for defeat.

It‚Äôs not okay to be an inferior human being. This is self-explanatory. If it isn't, get out of the gene pool.

The only way to stop these kinds of rationalizations is to stop failing. Just stop. Is it gonna be easy? No. Is it going to be worth it? Do it and find out for yourself.

#5 Understand Weakness.


**Weakness is a lack of something that‚Äôs needed to achieve a goal.**

Want to squat 600 pounds but can‚Äôt? You lack leg strength. 

Want to approach that chick but can‚Äôt? You lack social strength. 

Cracking under pressure when you want to be calm and composed? You lack mental strength.

**Everything wrong with you is due to a weakness of some kind. Even if you were dealt a shitty hand by the game of life you'd better play the fuck out of that hand. Make the most of it.**

Pinpoint your weaknesses through honest self-evaluation then fix them accordingly. The keyword is ‚Äúhonest.‚Äù Self-evaluation can quickly turn into self-delusion if you feed your ego. I‚Äôd rather be too hard on myself than too easy on myself; the former can still make you grow, the latter helps you stagnate and plateau.  

#6 Focus on stopping one and you'll stop the other.


The connection between rationalization and weakness cannot be overstated. You‚Äôre weak because you rationalize and you rationalize because you‚Äôre weak. 

When you focus on stopping one or the other, you‚Äôll notice that over time you stopped rationalizing AND being weak, assuming you‚Äôre putting in the work to actually grow.

Of course, there are those who stop rationalizing and are okay with weakness regardless. These people are hopeless. Don't worry about them. Chances are if you're browsing the subreddit you're probably not one of these people. 


Anyway, I could go on but I've given you all the tools to succeed. Stop rationalizing your weaknesses. Get strong.


tldr; **You‚Äôre weak because you rationalize and you rationalize because you‚Äôre weak.**

There will be a lot of yelling and CAPS in this post. Do NOT read if you're sensitive and get offended easily..

&#x200B;

The ""How to get laid"" mentality sets one up for a very precarious attitude and a deletrious one at that. \~It goes against the very core of TRP which is based on indifference, stoicism, realization and acceptance of reality, starting to put yourself on a pedestal, developing yourself because of selfish internal reasons (not external outcomes A.K.A. getting laid) . 

&#x200B;

Your propellers **MUST NEVER BE** ""WE ARE HERE TO GET LAID. HERE ARE SOME POINTS FOLLOW THIS SHIT FOR A YEAR TO GET SOME PUSSY ACTION...... MAY BE.""  


TRP is more about changing internal attitude than getting results. Getting results (or laid) is a by-product of reprogramming yourself (which WILL happen and you won't even care that it did) and hence living a longer, wiser (better frame) and more fulfilling life. But the very first prerequisite for getting laid is to be indifferent toward the thoughts of getting laid. It all starts in the mind, with the awareness of your own thoughts, discovering your own motivations and character. Awareness and recognition of underlying unwholesome mental motivations(AKA lustful thoughts which make you bring your ass to the gym/workplace) is the prerequisite to transformation.

IF YOU CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT GETTING LAID AND EVERY ACTION YOU DO IS TO GET SOME ACTION IN A YEAR OR SO, YOU WILL NEVER GET LAID, STAY UNHAPPY, IGNORANT AND OUTCOME DEPENDENT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

&#x200B;

Imagine Michael Jai White or Jason Statham saying on TV that they started fighting because they wanted some pussy back in the day. How fuckin shallow is that?   


The only such celebrity with the ""how to get laid mentality"" that comes to my mind right now was Mystery. He did get a lot of pussy in his pursuit but did he get freedom from external circumstances (true outcome independence?). We all know how that ended.

  


1. Your actions of self-improvement should come from a mindset of competitiveness/ambitiousness/selfishness NOT 'to get laid'.  
In other words : Your investment(via actions/thoughts/time devoted) in yourself should not be driven by 'Oh yeah! I'm gonna get laid in a year, i just need to stick to this regime' 
2. I'd rather have this line of thought (which isn't perfect btw) but much better: 'I'm gonna eat better because I wanna fuckin win that boxing tournament beat the crap out of \*insert Chad's name here\* or I wanna be able to do at least 1 muscle up in the next 10 days'. 
3. Get some competitive, toxic, masculine SOBs AKA Chads in your friend circle. You don't realize how much you need that toxicity(or rather positivity) in your life, they slap you with truth bombs in your face without thinking twice. They are like walking talking TRPers who hold you accountable for your laziness.
4. But The thing is: No Chad would wanna befriend your sensititve, outcome dependent ass, unless you are already improving or a threat to them or intimidating in some way (physically or psychologically).  
5. Easiest way to form an acquaintance with a Chad is to challenge them. Criticize their life style choices, shit test them (do not do this publicly if you're a sensitive bitch). Form a fuckin rivalry. Sounds pretty dang uncomfortable, right? Good. I'd take Rivals any day over 'friends'.
6. Rivalries have the most positive affect on your life. Keeps your bones greased and mind focused. How many people are jealous of you or would trade places with you right the fuck now? Any gym buddies? co-workers? Someone considers you a rival only when they respect you. Respect is gained only when you have something of value which others don't. You have something of value only when you put yourself in discomfort consistently, persistently and critically analyze your 'skill'.
7. Friendships are mostly 'insurance policies during a calamity' or 'jealousy in disguise' or \*insert any kind of selfish value sucking agenda\*. May be you have a compassionate totally selfless friend who you can count on and may be I'm wrong here. Still its best to be cynical here and have other back up plans when shit hits the fan rather than depending on this 'selfless friend'. Assume worst case scenario and have a plan B if Billy's wife doesn't want you to crash at their home anymore..
8. Got the crap beaten out of you by a Chad during a friendly spar? Good, now you are motivated as fuck, a hurt ego is the bestest of friends, you won't care about chasing skirts anymore, at least for a while. Getting physically dominated is the fastest way to get motivated and for a long time. Feeling physically inferior and inadequate compared to another male is one of the most basic emotions and quintessential to survival.
9. Have a friend circle you spar regularly with. Approach anxiety is nothing compared to a 6'8"" Behemoth of a fighter looking to tackle you with a shit-eating grin when the match is about to start. If you get used to the feeling of flight or fright you won't give a shit when you're rejected because the Will to survive is always more than will to copulate.
10. our motivations is our character and as BPilled as we are, we gotta rebuild our character and the thoughts that push us to improve.
11. The best way to improve is to measure your every GOOD AND BAD habit. Measuring puts a sense of achievement with every milestone. For example: Write down the amount of weights/reps you do for each exercise in an excel file. Every month, go in for a full body composition analysis (lean and fat both) and observe the graph of how you improve your lifting capabilities. I highly recommend it. It keeps you working towards your goal like a train on rails. Drink a lot of beer every day? Have a calendar and mark beer free days every month.
12. ALWAYS FUCKIN ASSUME YOU ARE BLUE PILLED BETA. I don't care if you're Orlando Bloom or Brad Pitt. Assume that you are not a pro, assume that you don't know shit yet, assume you are foolish. The day you stop caring about Alphas and Betas and fuckin Gammas and Deltas is the day you won't be one. The day you are not controlled by this terminology or your desire to stick your dick inside a wet hole is the day you will be truly security within yourself which leads to outcome independence. If someone calling you an incel brings out even a speck of retaliating thought inside you, know that you still measure yourself by how much you get laid and you get affected by other's opinion of you. Many will disagree with me here. Keep the downvotes coming.....
13. A newbie who knows he is bad with women and his life is a mess is already miles ahead of a foolish TRPer who just reads one book and faps and thinks he knows it all and is outcome independent now. 

&#x200B;

Example: You should eat better because you ignore your 'dopamine craving' train of thoughts (lizard mind) under control and you want to be stronger than you currently are and live longer. Your purpose should not be another dopamine fix. Be wiser (Wise = thinking about long term benefit at the cost of instant pleasure). 

**In five years from now The variety of instantly gratifying foods you're consuming will shrink to a half of what you're able to consume today. Would you rather slow your junk food consumption down or stop out of necessity. That day will come really soon when you won't be able to keep beer down in your tummy like you were able to when you were 18. CUT DOWN CONSUMPTION OF DOPAMINE SPIKING FOODS, Slow it down, eat responsibly and be very alert of what you put inside your mouth.**

&#x200B;

Lifting does help alleviate this and you can eat more than you chew every once in a while but not like when you were 18 and went clubbing till 5AM consumed shit ton of alcohol then went out to eat ham burgers at mcdonalds, then smoked some weed.

&#x200B;

Try doing that when you're in your 30s, your body will say a big **""FUCK YOU"" and reject all that shit.**  


It is better to eat the shit you love sporadically and have the option for doing so for a longer time than to be forced to give up eating stuff you love due to health reasons.

&#x200B;

When we sacrifice one 'dopamine-seeking behaviour' (instantly gratifying food) for another 'dopamine seeking behaviour' (sexual gratification), our mindset tends to stay the same. We Stay outcome dependent. Bottom line still remains the same : We crave dopamine.  


  
Give that up shit from the bottom of your heart..FUCKIN TELL YOURSELF YOU WON'T DRINK ALCOHOL FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. BE VIGILANT WHEN YOUR LIZARD BRAIN TELLS YOU TO FAP/EAT SHIT. TELL YOUR LIZARD BRAIN, YOU WILL EAT BROCCOLI EVERYDAY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. When you come home from a good butt kicking workout, you thank yourself (your wiser, intellectual mind) and feel fuckin awesome. Thats the same feeling you get The day you actually turn down drinking beer and give up bad habits, It truly feels liberating.   


The problem with setting boundaries is that you need to fuckin set boundaries for yourself first that you yourself have to obey. SAY NO TO YOUR DOPAMINE CRAVING MIND FOR ONCE before saying it to others. Do 10 push ups RIGHT FUCKIN NOW. Do it you pussy.....It is for you and the nurturing of your wiser 'intellectual part' of your mind.

&#x200B;

  


FRAME : You wanna know how to maintain frame? First you need to build a strong frame. Before that you need to define what is frame to you?  


Frame: What plan of action you have convinced yourself internally to follow for 'the rest of you life'. Rest of the opinions/views is all but gibberish. Being a man of action requires a plan of action and Not getting distracted over trivial shit (like feminism) Read about it, don't openly subscribe to any agenda. It will only blow up in your face. Forming an identity only brings madness and suffering your way. Be anonymous, keep a low profile (if your line of work allows it), keeps stuff mysterious and people curious. 

  
""**For the rest of my life""** is the key phrase here.  


A frame that is based on wisdom, longevity of life, building strength, skill and improvement.

That only comes when you are consistent, persistent and consciously manage your habits (everyone needs indulgence every once in a while but not overdoing it needs conscious effort)

Consistency comes with controlling your lizard mind (primitive brain). So either you control your own mind and form a good work ethic or someone else will employ you and control you. Its your choice.

&#x200B;

You will have a weaker frame if it is not long term, visionary and helps you in survival. 

&#x200B;

LIFTING: This is where it starts: The prerequisite to transformation:

For example: TRP has a frame: The Sidebar. The first thing it does is to prompt you to 

go and start LIFTING. It's the first step to self improvement.  


Does anyone disagree with that? Can anyone outframe TRP on that matter? HELL NO. 

BECAUSE TRP IS FOCUSED ON PUTTING YOU IN THE UPPER ECHELON OF HUMANITY (ARE YOU?), LONGEVITY OF YOUR LIFE and YOUR SURVIVAL AMONGST THE FITTEST.

Everyone has frame. It comes from a variety of variables : A set of preprogrammed instructions, a plan of action, a core philosophy a group of people subscribe to.

For example: One of my former acquaintances used to drink a lot every day. He asked me almost everyday to join him. I just started going to the gym and was consciously managing my thoughts, habits and friend circle. He recently called me and asked for my help. Now I like to help people, it is in my nature (I know its blue pilled as fuck). I recognized that part of me and set up some screening for the victim and some boundaries for myself (out of respect for my time), so that I don't feel guilty.  


I told him to go to the gym for at least 2 months first, get a personal trainer, then I will think about training together. To be honest, even if he went to the gym for a month I would have helped him but he wasn't committed enough (neither financially nor mentally), so there was no reason for me to care.

This was a shit test I wanted to make him jump hoops to test his commitment level because i don't wanna commit any more than he is committed to himself.

  
Same goes for any chick friends that I have.

&#x200B;

Enrolling at a gym was the best financial decision I ever made in my life. The returns are IMMEASURABLE as compared to the fee.

BUT, Lifting is only the prerequisite. Once you are at a point where the reward to risk ratios to lifting are really low compared to the amount of time and effort you're putting in, I'd say maintain your physique in the gym (around 10-15% bodyfat), stop increasing weights and GO JOIN A BJJ/BOXING GYM. You know why? 

After a point of time Lifting more weights starts working against you. It decreases your flexibility, agility and attractiveness. 

&#x200B;

Girls would rather fuck Jason Statham than a bodybuilder with a bubble gut.  


&#x200B;

And it does wonders for inner game. You become an elite inside your head. 

&#x200B;

A fighter has more odds of kicking a bodybuilder's ass than another bodybuilder. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now imagine actually being a guy who has Chads as acquaintances, is 15% bodyfat, knows Jiu-Jitsu/Boxing (at least the basics) or is good at calisthenics, is motivated by long term goals, does not drink alcohol. Imagine it for a second. Picture it in your mind.  


Vs   


A guy who is waking up every day motivated by the possibility of having sex in may be a year or two?

&#x200B;

 Who is more likely to give up? 

&#x200B;

Who is more likely to fall under depression?

&#x200B;

When you no longer require sex to have fun and maintain your psychological health is when you get to have sex.

Thats the paradox.  


The aim must be to become a guy who doesn't 'NEED' sex to be happy and is non-chalant about it. One has fun in other ways. Don't go around wasting time doing useless shit like riding a motorbike unless you're Marc Marquez(I know i did). If you commit to a hobby, do it everyday, become good at it. Make sure you are at least one of the top 3 guys around your area. It will take investment and effort and consistency. A time will come when you will get your dopamine fix out of these hobbies and then some. People will start recognizing you. Hell, you may even be able to earn money with your hobby and a day will come when you will need your employer less than he needs you because you will have other sources of income.

&#x200B;

When you will compete for psychological and physical dominance, you will learn clever comebacks UNCONSCIOUSLY when you get outwitted by Chads. It is fun outframing like minded people and outwitting them.

&#x200B;

Not sure if TRP addresses what im about to say but:  


A major part of staying happy is to be grateful for every single thing we take for granted and reduce unnecessary possessions. 

But don't be vocal about it, do not mention it to any one individual about how fuckin thankful you are if someone does shit for you. 

When you start being grateful for that piece of shit '04 honda Civic you own, you stop fuckin buying drive thru food and keep its interior clean. You sure as hell don't let any plate make a mess of your car even if she is an LTR unless they're cleaning it. (You sir are now setting boundaries)

&#x200B;

Humility keeps you grounded and happy and treasure the things you have in life. 

&#x200B;

I heartfully thank the ex-wives and ex-gfs of people like fuckin u/Archwinger, u/GayLubeOIL, illimitablemen, and whoever the fuck prompted them to make this subreddit and the genious level posts here. This what we have here is a fuckin gold mine. Please don't make it superficial and taint it with skin-deep shitposts like ""How to get laid"".

55,Success is not binary,167,0,167,fknwhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fknwhe/success_is_not_binary/,31,1584558936.0,"TL;DR ‚Äì if you subconsciously chase security, you will always remain in mediocrity. Why obsessing over being accepted and labeling ourselves often results in stopping at the bare minimum and lacking motivation to approach women, improve, and grow. Why women typically have more controlling behaviours, and ***why they find mediocrity unattractive.***

I want to talk a bit about the problems of seeing success as binary, and having a safety-obsessed mindset, and how that holds men back.

Binary thinking goes something like this: ‚ÄúI either succeed, or I fail‚Äù; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm either perfect, or I‚Äôm a failure‚Äù; ‚ÄúI‚Äôm either alpha, or I‚Äôm beta‚Äù; ‚ÄúI am either accepted, or rejected‚Äù. There is no in-between in this frame. This mindset is one of the main reasons why so many guys are terrified to do approaches. Defining yourself as one of two states in a binary spectrum is an indication of a security-obsessed mindset.

# The Security Obsession

Growth and improvement is not about ‚Äúbeing something‚Äù. ***The only people obsessed with ‚Äúbeing something‚Äù, are those who believe that the label will give them safety.*** Being alpha is not a label you are awarded that somehow grants you unconditional security. In fact, obsessing over the alpha label is typical beta behaviour. Alpha is an attitude, where you have freed yourself from external influences that might cause anxiety-motivated goals. Successful men power through failure with consistency because they are not chasing after the warm and secure feeling of success, but rather pursue the limits of potential, and push hard into uncertainty without anxiety of whether people will accept them or the concern of how they will be perceived.

# Why you stop improving AKA the ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù mindset

Being security-oriented will often cause you to improve until you reach a point of security, which you will then get comfortable in, becoming unwilling to budge from until anxiety catches up once again. Beta men are motivated to take radical action only when they believe something is expected of them ‚Äì they improve out of anxiety. You must leave that mindset behind. Security obsession is an inherently feminine trait. To cultivate a habit of constant improvement, don‚Äôt strive for some goal that you believe will magically alleviate your trauma-induced chronic anxiety ‚Äì strive for growth, understanding, pushing the limits of what‚Äôs possible, and exploring the ever-expanding possibilities of your potential. Go beyond what the normies consider possible and expected. This will make you attractive to both women and men.

# The Security Obsession in Women

Consistently anxious people, which includes almost all women and most men, tend to pursue certain goals only because they are convinced that reaching them will finally relieve their ceaseless anxiety ‚Äì this, however, never really relieves the anxiety, but it‚Äôs women‚Äôs only way of coping. This is one of the many reasons why women find micromanaging details and controlling other people very enjoyable. It‚Äôs why women so often try to control their surrounding in irrational ways ‚Äì a man‚Äôs worst mistake is buying into that method and catering to their whims. Women don‚Äôt want that, because the anxiety remains. They desire a man who can go far beyond that. What women want is a man who transcends those petty worries and almost invalidates them, because a woman can admire that ‚Äúunconcerned with pettiness‚Äù attitude.

One way to look at shit tests is as a manifestation of a woman‚Äôs anxiety in an attempt to test a secure frame. Most guys here know this. But to add to that, the reason why women are not interested in guys that fail shit tests, is that by doing so, you show her that you are just another **security-obsessed normie, stuck in mediocrity like her**, and she has enough of that on her own. Men with game are attractive, because they demonstrate they transcend social norms and the influence of public perception, and because of that can live lives that are extraordinary (which implies more intense emotional experiences) ‚Äì and women want a piece of that.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

If there is one takeaway here, it is that as long as you are trying ‚Äúnot to lose‚Äù, you will never achieve anything exceptional, since you will always be stuck on a road to safety. Instead of avoiding losing, aim for winning at the expense of comfort and security. Chasing success as a label means chasing security and safety. Don‚Äôt strive for security ‚Äì ***strive for transcendence.***

&#x200B;

1. Find out why and in what way you are caught up in adhering to the expectations of others
2. Free yourself from that concern through mindfulness
3. Independently determine your purposes, aiming for your personal transcendence, instead of security

Nobody wants to lose any developed gainz over time. What‚Äôs the possible solution? Obviously you can either wait until the gyms are back and running, or if you are a creative brah you can always improvise. Seriously, there is no point complaining and feeling sad that the gyms are closed. We live and let live. The process just forces us to adapt. 

Luckily, youtube has a plethora of different platforms that promote bodyweight workouts, calisthenics to name a few. If you have little to no equipment at all, furnitures and other solid materials can be used as exercise equipment. 

Tomorrow will be day 1 of not having a premium gym, at least for me. I‚Äôll be doing some bodyweight exercises and rep them to failure. Fortunately, in my home I have a barbell made out of concrete cement and I can improvise my workouts from that single equipment alone. But for those who really don‚Äôt have anything. I‚Äôm a good brah so I can provide some workouts for you guys. 

PUSH EXERCISES:

1. Push ups 
You can always progress your pushups by widening and narrowing your arms, as well as placing your foot on a chair to make it more declined giving your chest a much more harder push. Later on you can progress it by setting one arm pushups as your end goal in this temporary program. 

Diamond pushups are also good. 

2. Lateral raises 
If you don‚Äôt have any weights at home, you can always do Unloaded Lat Raises, where you just do the exact exercise and flexing your delts to failure. This is much better than no movement at all. 4 sets is a good metric til failure. Also, you can use a heavy book to add some weight, but bear in mind that grip will be compromised. 

3. Skull crushers 
This bodyweight exercise is good against a table or a solid platform. This mimics a push-up but with your elbows inclined giving that tricep some good activation. You can progress on this by decreasing the angle in which you push with your tris. 

LEG EXERCISES:

1. Bulgarian split squats 
You can do this by resting your leg on a chair and just do the exercise using bodyweight. Progress by either increasing the distance between the surface and your working leg, or you can have another chair placed across you where your working leg is on and do the exercise as it gives a deeper dip. 

2. Hip thrusts 
Pretty standard. Rest on a platform on a 45 degree angle and do the exercise. Progress by carrying a book or something heavy and do that until failure. 

3. Pistol squats
This alone can be pretty deadly for your legs. It requires balance, mastery and perfect execution to deliver a solid bodyweight squat. Progress by mastering the exercise, then carry something while doing it. It‚Äôs a pretty powerful workout that people underestimate so much. 

PULL EXERCISES:

1. Pull-ups 
If you don‚Äôt have any pull up bars at home, you can use a table and do some pulling under it. Progress by carrying a bag or something heavy. Repeat until failure. Progress by including your lower body as weight. 

2. If you have other recommendations for PULL EXERCISES, please include them especially for the ones without any equipment at all. So far, this is what I have, and with the barbell that I have I‚Äôll be doing deadlifts and rows. 

ISOLATION EXERCISES: There are a handful that you can do that are a simple YouTube search away that require zero equipment at all. They are mostly core exercises. Don‚Äôt lose your abs brahs! 

1. Planks
2. Bicycle crunches 
3. L-sits 
4. Reverse crunches 
5. Calf raises 
6. Mountain climbers 
7. Burpees 

You don‚Äôt only want to just keep moving to maintain your gainz and not lose any as well. What the fitness world taught me is not only to be disciplined but also to set goals in the process. Try to set a different goal from now that would align with this and in time when things are back to normal, we can always rebound back to them gainz. 

In traditional bodybuilding, we set goals through progressive overload. In this case, and in my case, my goal right now is to learn how to execute a one arm push-up. I believe the above mentioned exercises can help me reach that goal. 

There are a lot of workout programs focusing on just body weights. Progressing them through different angles and variations help. Read on calisthenics. Chris Heria is a good platform of knowledge to start, but there are more brahs out there on YouTube who preach the same shit. 

Brahs, we‚Äôre all gonna make it. Never let this time at home spent just by sitting on the couch and watching Netflix. Always keep moving and we will be flexing once again. There‚Äôs no other way around it. 

When you get back at your gym, you‚Äôll be thankful for learning what you didn‚Äôt know by doing these home workouts and applying them with better execution in the future. We are all in this together. Stay home and stay safe. üí™üèΩ",2020-03-18 00:14:04

We're gonna talk about technique. With all that is going on in the world right now, this is an excellent time to consider why focusing on half a dozen movements in the gym is detrimental to your overall success. 

First let's get some assumptions out of the way. Among those of you who will actually read this, only about one in five are actually going to the gym on a regular basis (meaning more than twice a week). Among those who do go regularly, many are only actually working a small number of muscle groups, and rarely work the opposite groups. For Example you'll see men who spend an inordinate amount of time on bench press without doing any pull exercise such as rowers to work the upper back. When this happens, you get disproportionate muscle build in the areas worked. Also, many make the mistake of not building the core, only occasionally working the front abdominals, and completely ignoring the obliques, hip flexors, and lumbar muscles. 

That's how you wind up looking like [this fellow.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2487/0852/products/COVER_55f8ecab-0edd-4891-aeac-7c828d04d1ff_1200x1200_crop_center.png?v=1549199588) There are a **lot** of men who idolize Schwarzenegger's physique in the 80's, but the fact is that Schwarzenegger used steroids to get there, and using steroids is the loser's easy way out. It was also an expression of [form over function.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ef/0c/cb/ef0ccbfa60869fc62c8359ae90a04aa6.jpg) and ignoring core build up is a fantastic way to invite all manner of injuries ranging from hernias to spinal fractures. Your core is what allows you to ***CONTROL*** the weight you are lifting. 

What a nice opportunity for a segway. Another dangerous and idiotic thing you'll see in the gym is men who feel the need to throw on far more weight than they can reasonably control. [This is a perfect example of what I mean.](https://www.t-nation.com/system/publishing/articles/10000100/original/Fake-Strength-Stop-Arching-the-Bench-Press.jpg?1377118228) Stop. Just stop. It isn't impressive, and you will hurt yourself. Lifting is all about controlling the weight. If you can't bust the bar off the rack without help, it's too much for you. If you can't lower the bar down to your chest without raising your back off the bench it's too much for you. Swallow your fucking pride, take some weight off, and work up to that goal slowly. Lifting like the idiot in the picture is a good way to pull every muscle in your back, and kill yourself when you lose control of the bar and it falls on your neck. You want to push yourself, sure, but not to such extremes that it looks comical, and dangerous. Safety should be your primary concern. 

Next, we should touch on cardio. As in: among the few who actually take the time to work out, only a small percentage give any attention to cardio. Sure you can bench press the entire Dallas Cowboy cheerleader squad, but can you maintain a light jog for 15 minutes? *Why does it matter* you might ask? *I have the kind of physique that would make Schwarzenegger green with envy, and women throw themselves at me vagina first* you might say? Because sex is a workout, and it requires stamina. No woman is gonna be interested if you can't keep fucking for more than a couple minutes. *I'm so out of breath, gimme a minute*. ***NO*** You need to spend just as much time building stamina as you do in the gym building muscles. Run. Bike. Swim. Row. Whatever you have to do, just build stamina. You need to be able to keep it up for at least 15 minutes at a minimum without slowing down or stopping. Two miles. Two 8 minute miles isn't an absurd goal, and there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to achieve it. 

Finally, I'd like to touch on flexibility. We've all seen *El Gigantor* in the gym with upper arms bigger than our waist, who can bicep curl a bulldozer but can't raise his elbows above his ears. While impressive, this certainly has its limitations. You don't want to be the dude who can't put on a T shirt, or comb your own hair without help. You need to be able to maintain full range of motion while you build muscles. That means the ability to raise your arm over your head and touch the opposite shoulder, the ability to stretch your legs past a 90 degree angle *both forward and to the side*, and any other number of movements that I don't feel compelled to list. The fact is that there are three facets to fitness: Strength, mobility, and flexibility. All three are equally important. It would be an injustice to yourself to ignore one or more of those three in favor of focusing just one.",2020-03-18 06:29:49

Achievement isn‚Äôt just something you go out and grab off the grocery aisle when you feel like. It‚Äôs a result of hard fucking work over a long fucking period of time. Exhibiting discipline and consistency in everyday life is what adds up to success in the long term.

Now this isn‚Äôt to say you should be a stuck up boring fuck who doesn‚Äôt know how to enjoy life. Enjoy life, but do so on your own terms while not straying on your mission or bending on your priorities.

Back in his bodybuilding days, Arnold Schwarzenegger would be in bed by 11 PM every night, even on Fridays while his friends were out partying and drinking, because it meant him getting the sleep necessary to recover and grow. 

The little things like going home a little early on Friday nights are the sacrifices you have to make to achieve the goals you set for yourself. 

Discipline and consistency will make you successful in reaching your long term goals. Hold yourself accountable. Be someone who sees the power of consistency, and take pride in setting yourself apart from the herd.",2020-03-17 16:32:31

If you go self employeed you can pay less tax. You may have security or freedom. You can't have both.(unless you're super weathly)  
I've tried to keep the maths as simple as possible, but reintroduction of figures is needed at points. Hopefully it doesn't trip people up. If it does, get better at maths. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Following on from a previous post I will outline a way in which the United Kingdom Tax system does this (HMRC) Comparing purchases & lifestyle choices made by a salaried employee vs. that of someone who runs a LTD company (1 employee/freelancer). 

I‚Äôm going to first set out a few key points that the future information will be built around. 

1) The pre-tax salary or profit will be ¬£30,000. This as of 2019 is the average full time salary in the UK. 

2) It is based of you paying ¬£250 per month into a private pension. (10% of pre-tax salary) 

3) I‚Äôm assuming the individual is single & has 0 dependents. So it keeps tax credits out of the equation. 

4) There are no student debt repayments to be made. 

5) They are sharing a house with one other individual. 

6) Food is calculated at ¬£60 a week. Avg ¬£260 per month. 

7) They have no car. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The average rent, council tax & basic bills in the UK are ¬£650.14 (¬£483.5, ¬£69.63, ¬£97.01)

The salaried employee will take home each month. ¬£1,795.   
 So they have ¬£1144.86 to spend as they wish. 

Taking food into account they now have **¬£884.86** as disposable income.   
 

The self-employed individual pays tax on a yearly basis once their EOY accounts are done. 

Before this they take home ¬£3000 a month. ¬£719 is tax & NI free so covers any complications with paying tax on money needed for rent. 

10% into Private pension. 

¬£650.14 for rent bills etc.

They now have ¬£2099.86.

Of this ¬£68.69 of their tax-free allowance remains. 

Depending on the business. Food expense can be run through the business. Think coffee shop etc. So your business can feed you. It‚Äôs passed as a business expense.   
 

Accounting for food the self-employed person has **¬£1839.86** as disposable income. ¬£955 more than the SE. Tax will need to be paid if this remains at the end of the year.   
 

They can now use this to help run their business by buying assets, equipment or ‚Äúinvestment items‚Äù This can be art, computers, cars etc. It has to link into the business in someway. So you can‚Äôt buy flights to Paris with your LTR/FWB and run it through the business. Unless‚Ä¶ There is a conference that weekend relevant to your industry. 

&#x200B;

**A short note on tax.**

  
 Dividends - You get ¬£2000 as a tax-free dividend allowance. After that it‚Äôs 7.5% until you hit the higher rate (32.5%, >¬£50k total earnings p/a)   
 Income Tax & Ni ‚Äì Whatever is remaining you‚Äôll owe as if you were a normal salaried employee. 

To minimise the tax you pay you can some of the following through your business; 

Car, car insurance, fuel, Tv, computers, ‚ÄúOffice‚Äù Furniture, flowers for your mum.   
 

**VAT ‚Äì Value added tax**

You‚Äôve seen those pissy feminist banging on about paying 20% tax on tampons? Well that‚Äôs VAT.   
 

If you‚Äôre business is VAT registered then you get to claim that additional 20% back on a monthly or quarterly basis. It‚Äôs on a lot of products which is really shouldn‚Äôt be. It was originally intended for ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù goods.   
 

It features on adult clothes, fuel, toilet roll, soap, shower gel, most electronic items etc. Just ask for a VAT receipt when you next go to the supermarket and see how much you‚Äôre giving to HMRC for basic products.   
 

When you run them through your business this is where you get a nice double bonus. 

1) You can offset this as a business expense and reduce your personal tax bill. As you have less profit.

2) You get the VAT refunded.   
 

**E.g. 1**

You have to buy a new computer for you business. It costs ¬£409. ¬£68.17 of that is VAT. 

As a cost to a business it‚Äôs ¬£340.83.

For the private individual to do this it costs ¬£409. However if you recalculate it to pre-tax earnings, the true cost of what you need to earn. Then it is somewhere in the region of - ¬£511.   
 

*Formula*   
 *(Pre tax earnings/post tax earnings) = (Pre tax computer / post tax computer)*   
 

**You‚Äôre paying tax twice. Once for your earnings & a second time on VAT.**   
 

Finally to compare the two tax bills on the ¬£30000 earnings. For ease of calculation.   
 1) They both spend ¬£884.86 of their income/business expense. 

2) They live equivalent lives. 

The Salaried employee has ¬£0 left. But all tax & NI is paid. ¬£5462 in total. 

The self-employee has ¬£17381.68 in ‚Äúprofit‚Äù including their tax-free allowance. ¬£2000 for dividends has already been removed.   
 

They pay ¬£396 in tax for the year. ¬£1063 in NI. A total of ¬£1459. 

Just by a simple change in employment status the difference is **¬£4003.** Both have ¬£3000 in a private pension & a ¬£750 HMRC contribution. No personal savings however. 

*I‚Äôve left out some obvious elements*

1) No sick pay for self employed persons.

2) You‚Äôll probably need an accountants help with some things. 

3) If your business is VAT registered then some work e.g. consultancy is VAT applicable. So can mess with your VAT refunds. 

4) There are some worker protections for employed staff. However these are being eroded in the UK.   
   
 That‚Äôs a very basic overview of how tax works. I‚Äôm not an accountant so these figures won‚Äôt be 100% but are an example of how it works. 

Any questions, just ask.",2020-03-18 04:39:24
62,How To AMOG Beta Males,431,0,431,fjmm5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fjmm5q/how_to_amog_beta_males/,267,1584400872.0,"It shouldn't surprise anyone here that the Red Pill is packed with Beta Males. In fact, it's absolutely crawling with them. The problem with any forum on masculinity is that it inevitably gets filled with unmasculine men who have their own theories on masculinity. Unavoidably the forum starts catering down to what the beta males already do and therefore want to hear. In other words, reductive power point style lists, conduct manuals, and explanations on why their current behavior is okay. What they desperately want to believe is that the behavior that they are forced to exhibit in their heavily taxed 9-5 corpo cuck job will magically get them laid, even though it‚Äôs not and is actually pulling them down into a soul draining spiral of depression.

Sexual Selection is a means by which females chose exciting new phenotypes for the next generation. Females want the fastest antelope, the loudest songbird and the most obnoxious douchebag. They want the male who has what others don't and can thus disrupt the status quo. Beta Males are the status quo which is why their whole strategy is imitation. If you are using pickup lines you are by definition a beta male as you are sexually reliant on imitating the mating strategies of other males. You have admitted to yourself that you are uninteresting, incapable of becoming interesting and need to fool women into believing you are something that you are not. Alpha males win the race. Beta males buy trophies so they can trick people and themselves into thinking they won the race. If you are interested in seeing this latter behavior first hand, head over to the seduction subreddit. But I must warn you they are complete and utter fags.

Next we should answer the question: When and why is it necessary to AMOG aka establish social dominance? First and foremost, we need a clear definition of what a beta male is. A beta male is a mushy turd that takes the shape of his immediate surroundings. Beta males prefer comfort over abstract freedom. They enjoy the warmth and security of the herd and spent their youth being molded into the perfect worker drone consumer by media and education system. They're comfortable with how things are and dislike change. Therefore if you are pushing for change or advocating for something that is different from the norm you must first break the will of the beta males so they stop clucking and shut the fuck up. Obviously the big picture of what you're trying to accomplish will remain a complete mystery to beta males because they are pragmatards who don't think top down or think in terms of potentiality. In other words, whenever you try to accomplish anything big you will be called an asshole, crazy or dismissed with an all-inclusive meaningless label. That's okay. No one accomplished anything meaningful without being hated on in the process, just ask Steve Jobs. Extraordinary men must give themselves permission to perform extraordinary acts so they can rise above the ordinary.

**Write An Article On AMOGing Beta Males:** The easiest way to AMOG the most Beta Males is to write an article about AMOGing Beta Males. It's pretty simple and has an interesting element of recursion. The key takeaway is understanding why this works. Beta Males are insecure about an endless assortment of trivialities. These insecurities are then weaponized against beta males to make them compensate with overpriced GQ commodities, man up and get married and work a bullshit job until they die. Beta Male insecurities are like MKULTRA control words, they shut down thinking and induce compliance. My advice is to figure out what beta males are insecure about and mention it as casually as possible. Then when the beta male predictably spergs out, use their sperg out as an excuse to exclude them from the decision making process. In other words, exactly how I'm going to use this post to ban a bunch of sensitive losers.

**Do You Even Lift Bro:** The easiest way to increase your SMV, become more confident and have a higher tolerance for stress is to put in serious work at the gym. It's never been easier to find a gym nearby because there's more of them than ever before. Gyms are far better equipped than even 10 years ago. Finally, Bodybuilding is no longer a secretive cult like it was in the 1960s-1990s. All the information you'll ever need is available on YouTube or Amazon bookstore. At this point there is literally no excuse beyond being lazy or retarded. Beta Males know looking like shit is their fault and their fault alone. Broaching the topic directly or just looking fit, is enough to remind them of this fact and send them into an AMOGed spiral. Every article on lifting has hordes of betas crying how jumping jacks in their mom's basement is a legitimate form of exercise. Blue checkmark Twitter is upset that Bronze Age Mindset and fans post physique. Lifting is the universal AMOG. When men feel insecure, their girlfriends notice and look to the source of the insecurity for an opportunity to branch swing. In my experience it's not muscularity itself that gets you laid it's the high stress tolerance gained from becoming muscular and women noticing how other men behave towards you.

**ASStimidation:** while the previous sections explain general AMOGing principals, this section puts it all together in a practical way for a common place situation. Anyone who's spinning plates in 2020 knows that these tardettes are constantly on social media farming their orbiters for validation. What if I told you that there was an easy way to make the orbiters work in for you? Anyone who has been following Red Pill's lifting advice aka applying the Red Pill should have a thick muscular ass from squatting and deadlifting. Steal her phone and then Snapchat or Instagram story a pic of your ass to her orbiters with a flirty caption ""feeling like a snack."" Wait 20 minutes and send a second pic revealing whose ass it is captioned ""y'all niggas gay"". Within an hour her phone should be blowing up with angry ASStimidated beta males explaining how a mean Alpha hurt their *feeeelings* by AMOGing them. Beta males are two things: thirsty for sexy pics and on the brink of abandoning heterosexuality. If questioned tell her that you were feeling sexy and that you didn't know that all her guy friends are gay.

A lot of men mistakenly believe that being Alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident. Alpha males don't act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition. Things work in the human world exactly how they work in the animal world. Competition can be physical, musical, financial, intellectual or psychological. Beta males hate competition and hide behind contrived morals to justify their uncompetitiveness. Masculinity is competition. The most masculine animals are the most competitive ones. There is no climbing the dominance hierarchy without competing against other men and AMOGing them in some way. If your goal is to get to the top, you can't just sit around defensively passing shit tests‚Äîyou have to actively compete against other men.


Since everything is currently going into lockdown now is the perfect time to focus on self improvement. I've mentored thousands of men through fitness and philosophy coaching, here are a few of their [experiences in their own words.](https://glophilosophy.org) You can contact me through that link or shoot me a PM if interested.",2020-03-16 23:21:12
63,Conflicting Mindsets: Getting Laid vs. Being Indifferent,56,0,56,fjwc1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fjwc1l/conflicting_mindsets_getting_laid_vs_being/,41,1584436260.0,"There's a couple mindsets that get emphasized here and they are exclusive of each other.

The first is how to get laid. The second is being indifferent to whether you get laid or not.

I see this confuse people because posts often make it sound that by not caring, suddenly girls will feel challenged and do the work for you: opening, closing, and consistently hitting you up to get fucked. That is generally not going to happen for 99% of men. Especially not with hot women.

Being indifferent, going monk mode, or having the IDGAF attitude generally will not get you laid. If you're a pro-athlete, big dick in your industry, or the hot DJ this week it'll happen. Otherwise, you need to work. Don't be a clown, don't be needy, but get to work and care about the results of your work.

It's freeing to have the indifferent mindset at times because it allows you to perform at a high level with other things. For example: I was indifferent to chicks during law school and achieved the things I needed to do. Immediately before and immediately afterwards, I fucked everything that moved. There's a time and place for both.

If you want to get laid and spin plates with regularity then it takes work. You have to care about the goal because that means you pursue and own the results. It requires a mindset completely opposite of the former. It requires an outgoing personality. It takes consistent lifting and eating. It means being persistent with opening, leading, closing, and following up with chicks that you want to fuck or want to keep fucking. After that, they're hooked and will hit you up. You don't get hung up on chicks who don't pan out because you're already onto the next, and you're constantly restocking the pool of potential plates. That is the IDGAF aspect of this mindset.

When you have the time in your life to pursue getting laid, then you need to get laid, a lot. You need to study game and get big. Every man needs to fuck a lot of women to understand the feeling of ownership and leadership that men need to experience. You need to feel that dominance over women because it's in our nature. It takes effort and persistence to sharpen your game and frame. That way, when you need to adopt one mindset or the other, you have the experience and confidence that you can do what you need to do, when it needs to be done.

TDLR: There is a mindset to getting laid and there is a mindset of being indifferent. Both have their roles. When you're going to adopt one mindset, adopt it fully.",2020-03-17 09:11:00

I just want to give back to this community a bit. Pretty much everything is already said, read the sidebar, lift , do what you want in life and don't be a little bitch and when things don't go your way, work harder or change approach. And hey this sub has gone to utter shit because the ""alpha"" guys realised it's not all about the girls and how to do cold approach. You guys are too sex depraved to realise there are more important things in life than getting a smelly pussy.

Anyways quick post . Stop trying to entertain every girl you meet. Stop trying to find the next line in your chat, stop trying to pick up the conversation after a dead silence or pause. Why do YOU have to be the entertainer and the one to keep the pace up. Let the girl do the work for once. These b are getting too adhd by the constant likes and approval of instagram and they can't even form half a sentence nowadays. 

It's not your job to do that. An interesting girl will keep the convo up. An interesting girl will ask you questions too because she genuinely cares or is just a decent human being. If you go out with a b and you feel like you are doing an interview, that's because that's what's happening. It's not supposed to be like this. I get it you may not have many common points but there are so many things to talk about if you know how to converse. 

I'm not going out lately a lot, I used to do that when I was younger. Now my lifestyle has almost taken care of that lol. Girls see me doing interesting shit and they hit me up and say it'd be nice to meet you. Why? Because most people are doing nothing with their lives. I see my family all glued up to a phone. Retards. Don't be like this. And if your friends are like this, change them. Go fucking monk mode until you meet new people.

This also applies to chatting. I know many of you like this way of communication and I get it. It's instant , it's fast . But it only hurts you and your perception. Be busy. Keep texting only for logistics. Don't waste all your subjects in chatting. Tell that to her in person. And you are not supposed to be a fucking shoe carpet for m'ladies. If they are boring, if they respond with an emoji or a thumbs up, don't even bother don't even tell them to fuck off . Don't even try to think of the next interesting line. Just skip this b and live your life. Let them do the work once. Don't answer. or answer with just a thumbs up or emoji. Freak her out a bit. Don't be the average fedora tipper. Have some fucking pride and respect for yourself.


And hey, I hope it's not too late when you realise that pussy doesn't even matter. Like at all. I know, you are insecure now, and some may not have sex at all but ..whatever, experience can't be transferred. I'll try to answer to any questions tomorrow. But be your best self guys . Things are very simple and we are too retarded to understand this. Do some sports, have an interesting passion and chase it, be creative and productive and you will be happy. Having a nice company and a chick that gets you is also nice. Anyways. Gl with the covid shit",2020-03-16 05:08:45

Along side your long-term investments, not spending money frivolously. To help keep more money in your pocket, a potentially important skill in life is bargaining/haggling. This is related to smaller purchases <¬£1000 etc.   
 

If you‚Äôve had your eye on a certain product for a while and saved up enough money to buy it outright. You‚Äôll be able to save some money easily by just asking for it.   
 

This advice generally applies to quality goods that have higher margins than products you can buy online etc. But are made by local or bespoke suppliers. Think watches, suits or specialist sports equipment. Send hand equipment is another are it can be used.   
 

Brick & Mortar shops are crying out for trade and will gladly take some money off the market prices to get your cash in their pocket.   
 

E.g. I purchased a watch last year the RRP was ¬£750. Nothing too extravagant, but I wanted a nice watch to celebrate closing a chapter of my life. I liked the look of the watch and asked the assistant the price. 

Me ‚Äì ‚ÄúHow much for X?‚Äù  
 

SA ‚Äì ‚Äú¬£750 sir‚Äù  
 

Me ‚Äì ‚ÄúHmm ok, may I try it on?‚Äù   
 

SC ‚Äì ‚ÄúSure‚Äù  
 

Then a bit of back a forth about me. Normal salesmen spiel.   
 

SC ‚Äì ‚ÄúSo what do you think?   
 

Me ‚Äì ‚ÄúI like it, but I‚Äôm not sure on the price.‚Äù  
 

SC ‚Äì ‚ÄúWe could do it for ¬£650, if you would like?‚Äù  
 

Me ‚Äì ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an improvement. But how much for cash?‚Äù  
 

SC ‚Äì ‚ÄúI‚Äôll check with my boss.‚Äù (Comes back a few minutes later) ‚Äú¬£550, cash sir‚Äù   
 

Me ‚Äì I‚Äôll take it.   
 

In addition to just asking, I went in towards the end of a quiet month. When I knew they would be trying to hit sales targets before being appraised for their bonuses. I did some research on the watche(s) I wanted too.   
 

In business cash flow is one of the most critical elements to keeping the doors open. So use it to your advantage. You must be willing to walk away if you don‚Äôt like the price. (I bought an expensive suit by not following this advice)  
**Don‚Äôt get attached to the item.**   
 

I very rarely pay full price for anything now. However I generally only buy higher quality items. I‚Äôve found they last longer, look better. Over the long run work out cheaper than multiple lower quality items. (Item cost/days of use)   
 

N.B. I know that jewellers know they will have to bargain with customers and put an inflated price on their stock. So they may knock a few quid off to seem like they are giving a good deal, to begin with.

I'll discuss some interesting facts about CV19 that I learned from family in the healthcare industry and which stock has rocketed to my #1 position in my watch list.

* Core information will cover CV19's updated morbidity rate thanks to South Korea, which is 0.75%, and what that means for the US. If we had as much capacity in our hospitals as they do we'd probably see a similar rate. Unfortunately we're closer in the number of hospital beds per capita similar to Italy. 

* Additionally, thanks to this damn thing starting in China, our supply chain is broken and many of our medical staff no longer have personal protective items to keep them safe and doctors and nurses are succumbing to the illness.

* Lastly, investors in CMG will be big winners once this is all over.  They've already fallen about 40% from their high, but will remain open during the various closures as take-out, so the damage to their profitability will mollified, unlike many other restaurant chains.",2020-03-17 07:23:19

> Now we would usually wrestle for fun but I'd always let her win. I think she took pride in winning but whenever I told her I wasn't going serious, she would say ""yeah right"" . But if it made her happy it wasn't an issue.

Didn't assert his dominance, and let her win for ""her happiness"". Very BP signs.

Also notice how she says ""yeah right""? Her deluded brain actually believes she is winning. 

> Now I'm not a big guy. I'm about 5""10 and 175lbs. I'm skinny fat basically. 

TLDR - I look like shit.

> I occasionally lift weights so I'm pretty strong. 

Translation - I've been to the gym 2 or 3 times.

> She's 5""11 and 165-170lbs. She plays Volleyball for our college at a competitive level, so she's an athlete.

Okay, so his GF is a competitive collegiate athlete and basically the same size as OP.

> Well the other day she initiated another wrestle and I let her win, until she said ""ok let's see what you got"". I wasn't sure what she meant so I asked her and she asked me to go serious.

OP's girlfriend begins to wake up from delusion. She knows he isn't really trying. But has deluded herself to believe she can still stand a chance.

> So we wrestled and I pinned her rather quickly. She tried to break free but couldn't. 

Reality manifests itself. Reality is that despite being of similar size and way less athletic, he's still **far** stronger than her. 

> I could tell she was a bit shaken so she asked to go again, and we went again but i got her in a headlock. 

OP's gf is ""shaken"", aka her reality is being shattered. She is realizing the lies that BP society and feminism have taught her. 

> I didn't squeeze too hard, but just enough to hold her and she tapped. We went a third time and i pinned her.

OP says he ""didn't squeeze too hard"", meaning that he's STILL holding back and easily winning. Even with restrained strength, he makes her tap in a regular headlock (not even a real chokehold).

> At that point she seemed confused and things got a bit awkward. 

""Confused"" means that she's realised what she's been told is a complete lie.

> She then told me she never knew I was serious when I said I wasn't really trying.

Aka her hamster brain was spinning so much that she genuinely thought she was winning. 

> Since then, her mood has been lower. She's usually bubbly but this time I noticed she was low and a bit mopey. 

OP's girlfriend is adjusting to her new reality, as she has realized the extent of male strength. Hell she probably doesn't even know that he was STILL holding back when he beat her.

OP mentions in another comment that he is ""quite strong"" because he bench presses 80kg. Make what you will of that, but benching your own BW isn't that impressive by lifting standards. He probably is stronger than the average dude (who apparently can only bench 60kg), but whatever.

TLDR -, **a skinny fat male with minimal lifting experience and lack of athletic background, completely DESTROYED a female collegiate volleyball player of the same size, while holding back.**

Now this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone with half a brain, but feminism and BP society, have convinced women that they can kick ass. Probably a lot of them influenced by the dumb hollywood movies. And I wouldn't doubt that BP folk encouraged this nonsense belief.",2020-03-14 19:56:31

The irony...",70,0,70,fimeq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fimeq4/when_they_say_choice_yeah_right_the_irony/,24,1584237285.0,"**TL:DR - Calling your biggest compulsion of all a choice has to be the greatest irony in history. Taking credit for everything that's actually done by nature and calling it ""choice"" is dumb. ""Love is a choice"" is the mother of BP delusions.**

Today a whatsapp group of which I am also a part of (part family, part friends) has a heated discussion over a celebrity figure talking about her friend cheating with another guy. Naturally they also come up with men who cheat and the discussion goes on as to what's acceptable in a relationship and what's not. 

And you know the word comes up that feminists are so fond of using? Choice. The celebrity girl used the word and all others caught on to it. Apparently it was a moral choice. Apparently love is a <cough, cough> CHOICE! The rest is on the lines of ""blah blah blah, choice. blah blah"" - the usual rhetoric (women's dialogues seem so scripted with RP eyes that I swear they probably rehearse these lines in their circles). A woman should have the choice to be with who she wants...

The discussion went on aimlessly over a question of choices after that. The irony? We're talking about something where no only really chooses, only their bodies do.

Women's need to use the word ""choice"" is directly proportional to their internal feeling of being a victim (because only a starving man is obsessed with food). And honestly, it's utterly absurd that they describe their relationships as a ""choice"". Pragmatic yes, but far less of a choice than anyone wants to admit.

Relationships can't really work well only on conscious logic. If you think sexual instincts are Machiavelian, relationships that are entirely based on rational logic and pragmatism are much worse. They end up only considering the provider and become an emotionally soul-less, cold blooded business transaction. It's only a question of how soon the provider becomes a diving board for men that are actually attractive that one can fall in love with. The rational mind making entirely logical choices -- is only for the robots. 

Let's go beyond logic and consider a much more powerful form of choice. What would happen if we had true choice over our bodies and emotions? Just think - what would it be if you could truly love and be happy at will? Ideally, you'd have complete control over your biochemistry and therefore you could fall in love with anyone, or even experience all those feelz even if no one was around. You could be blissed out and totally content. Ironically this could make you so self sufficient that the very need for relationships could go DOWN. A breakup would be nothing more than a bump on the road. If she was also that way and you both chose to be in a relationship, it would be pretty incredible and idyllic. 

Also, if she could truly choose love, that beta husband might actually be loved and find great sex and respect for once (not that this is actually good for him to stay complacent and a fatass). If you could truly choose, you could also choose not to cheat and be no worse off for it.

If love was a choice, attraction and seduction would never be as important as they are. Temptation would lose its hold over you. Orbiters wouldn't have to exist. Love would become....easy.

If sex was a choice, there would be no dead bedrooms...

Love as a choice is the ultimate BP dream. If it were true, your blue pilled dreams would actually become true. Unconditional love would be a reality.

Does ANY of this ever happen? No. 

In fact this is probably at the root of all BP delusions, that love as we see it is something that can happen at will. It is why people try so hard when they realize a relationship isn't working and end up doing exactly the wrong things. 

The only choice literally lies in picking out one guy from a list of boys all ready to throw themselves at her boots. Even that isn't much of a rational conscious choice - it goes by feels. If it was choice, relationships could function by logic and principles. But they don't.

Sex is man's second biggest biological compulsion after the survival instinct, and today in prosperous times it is the biggest. Attraction is not really a choice. It happens to you. **Being as attractive as possible can be a choice, but the whole process of attraction itself runs on instinct**. Sex is such an enormous naturally created compulsion that you might find the biggest sex scandals emerging especially in places where people try very hard to pretend they're above it.

Think of just how hard it is to stop yourself from giving your dick (and women their clits or breasts) a free pass. If it just revs up the drive a bit, you just can't resist. Your sex instincts are kept in just enough control so that you can function normally at work, sometimes not even that much. You have a bit of control over some fine details on just how you wanna use your dick, but you have no control over the the sex instinct itself.

Are your thoughts under control? Nah, your brain churns out tens of thousands of them all the fucking time, maybe a dozen ideas of which are actually relevant and useful. 

Your emotions? They're essentially reactions to whatever happens. They drive you into obsession and often you're powerless to resist. Name any emotion that came up at will at full power the moment you wished for it. Never. **Emotions are reactions, not choices. At their proactive best they are a driving force of desire, but not really choice**. Life would become too simple if you could just summon happiness, passion, drive and romance at will. Your sex drive comes easy, because first of all it's barely in control to begin with.

The need for relationships or emotional fulfillment aren't choices either. They're hardwired into biology. Speaking of biology, what about your body? You can only consciously control some of your muscles, some of the time. Otherwise you can't control a damn thing that happens in a single cell in your body. It's all nature doing everything for you. To rebuild your body, you slog at the iron temple for years, but the detailed repair work? Your body rebuilds itself, you just get to control your reps and diet. You can't fix a single cell in this body on your own.

Give yourself complete freedom for sometime, no rules, no discipline, no restraint. What happens? You self destruct in a mess of depression and addictions. Most of these celebrities are in fact walking train wrecks behind the scenes, they even make good publicity from their shit. But that's not what you wanted. You said you wanted to live by free choice. Why would you choose to make your life hell? Logically, you would choose to live wisely and blissfully right? 

Look at what you did, not what you said. **Because you are NOT free, your haven't made a choice at all. What you really did was to give all your compulsions a free pass, with no limiters and no discretion**. You are a hypocrite for thinking you actually had as much control over your ""choices"" as you think. Some of the biggest wrecks in human history are people who believed they were truly free. The people who found freedom to shape their lives were in fact very disciplined and focused.

And you expect someone more emotionally sensitive than you to somehow make love and sex a choice? It's hilarious, this pretense that you have somehow mastered yourself.

This goes even further when they talk about other choices - it could be about anything. Look at every single one of them, and soon you'll see there's no choice in what is essentially compulsive hive mind behavior.

Women give themselves a lot of credit for creating new life via pregnancy, often acting like they're doing it. But what they're really doing is putting up with the pain and suffering and experience of a natural process. It is nature that builds every cell in your body. We just have a bit of control over diet, exercise, habits and medical help, but really, the body is just building itself. We take way too much credit for ourselves. All we can do is just make nature's work easier.

It even goes to the choice to abort. Well, the need to choose that only exists because before that, there was a moment where the sex instinct overrode all choice. Unfortunately pregnancy after sex isn't a choice either.

So when they come to you and say ""A woman has a choice..."" or that ""They chose a relationship..."" or when you hear some celebrity spout the choice nonsense, start laughing. Choice doesn't exist nearly anywhere on the scale we think it does. Not by orders of magnitude. When they say my choice, just replace it with ""My compulsive instinct"" and you will free yourself from all illusion.

The obsession with choice has come from a subconscious knowing that we're not really in control of all that much, and we're not willing to admit it as this will make us look like we're slaves to our bodies and minds, which we are. Accepting that keeps us humble and actually choose for once. But you know, to admit the truth to ourselves is too hard. By selling the narrative of choice, all we've ever done is to delude ourselves while our instincts run riot.

Love, attraction and sex are compulsions - love is the mother of all compulsions. The only thing you can do is to choose if you want attraction or revulsion. Choose the right one, or else invariably, inevitably, you will be forced to deal with the other. 

So when people say ""You can't force someone to love you"", they're not really talking about absolute choice, even if that's what they believe. No one has such power over their minds and bodies or relationships - if someone really did, they'd bypass the entire circus it takes to find love. What they really mean is, ""Love isn't possible without setting your compulsive biological instincts free"". 

To that I'll add ""within healthy boundaries"".

You can only work with the forces of nature and keep those compulsions in healthy boundaries - you have only that much choice. All you can do is help nature do its job more easily and not get in the way. Ensure you are sufficiently attractive and lay down the boundaries, for which you might have to undo a lifetime of bad habits. 

Now breaking old habits definitely requires you to make a choice, for once. Your conscious mind has to override old dysfunctional pathways and rewire your brain in the process. That's literally the only place in life where you actually choose. And you still wouldn't have chosen had you not been hit by a painful bolt of red lightning.

Critics have described it as: 
>""not merely a diatribe against women, but an all-out invective against marriage... This decaying of Rome's social and moral standards has caused marriage to become the offspring of greed and corruption. Men have become weak, and allow women challenge male supremacy so that marital power relations now favor women."" 


Sounds a lot like today, huh? Here's a little snippet from the actual writing:

>Never will you find a woman who spares the man who loves her; for though she be herself aflame, she delights to torment and plunder him. So the better the man, the more desirable he be as a husband, the less good will he get out of his wife. No present will you ever make if your wife forbids; nothing will you ever sell if she objects; nothing will you buy without her consent. She will arrange your friendships for you; she will turn your now-aged friend from the door which saw the beginnings of his beard""


>""Crucify that slave!"" says the wife. ""But what crime worthy of death has he committed? "" asks the husband; ""where are the witnesses? who informed against him? Give him a hearing at least; no delay can be too long when a man's life is at stake!"" ""What, you numskull? You call a slave a man, do you? He has done no wrong, you say? Be it so; but this is my will and my command: let my will be the voucher for the deed."" Thus does she lord it over her husband. But before long she vacates her kingdom; she flits from one home to another, wearing out her bridal veil; then back she flies again and returns to her own imprints in the bed that she has abandoned, leaving behind her the newly decorated door, the festal hangings on the walls, and the garlands still green over the threshold. Thus does the tale of her husbands grow; there will be eight of them in the course of five autumns----a fact worthy of commemoration on her tomb!


I linked the entire poem above if you'd like to read it and don't mind the heavy cultural references, but these few paragraphs alone tell so much. They show that female nature is indeed female NATURE, the same value-less behavior was going on in other societies thousands of years ago. 


So, once again, we've allowed women equal opportunity to shape our society and culture, and have arrived at the same emasculating pit-fall as the Romans did. We're at a crossroads: we can allow the path we're on to continue and end up as they did, with their society slowly degrading until they were conquered by invading tribes of disorganized barbarians. Or: we can make a change, stand up for ourselves, and return to the values of the ancestors that carried us this far. The onus lies with you, with us.

For those that care, I found Redpill philosophy early on, and have deeply ingrained it in my worldview. Some of the best advice I have ever received is: ""Learn the theory, then throw it all away"". Once you have fully explored and absorbed the knowledge available here, you're not doing yourself much good by continuing to read it over and over and over again, ad nauseam. There comes a point where you need to step away, stop learning theory, and start integrating into real life. You will begin to see the philosophy you've learned manifested in real life, and will gravitate towards the writings, art, and actions that align with your worldview. Through this is how you truly change yourself, and the world. The awakening you've had will never go away.",2020-03-14 07:38:53

I'm a big comedy fan.  But, post red pill, it's been more difficult to admire my former [heroes](https://therationalmale.com/2017/06/13/kill-your-idols/).

""Theogate"" in the comedy community is the rumor that Theo Von slept with Christina Pazsitzky, Tom Segura's wife.  Tom and Christina are widely beloved in the comedy community, and her affair would be a bummer.

Christina and Theo Von have both denied the rumors. Tom and Christina decided to bring Theo on their podcast to squash the beef.

Body Language Drama YouTuber takes some interest in the situation.  We can **feel** the tension in the room.

The Body Language Drama expert knows that Christina is hiding something.  Theo is pretty relaxed throughout the whole thing, and denies anything happened.  Christina is anxious that Tom will get upset. Why would Tom get upset if there wasn't an affair?

The answer, of course, is AWALT.  Christina was hitting on Theo.  She wanted to have an affair, and Theo denied her advances.

The Body Language Drama interpretter cannot come to this conclusion.  Women have never hit on him. He's never seen women be the sexual aggressor before, so he can't figure out what's happening.

He doesn't know AWALT so he cannot figure it out.

Theo Von and Tom Segura are the physical embodiment of Alpha and Beta.

This story has a minor happy ending in that it looks like Theo and Christina didn't sleep together.  Doesn't mean she hasn't cheated on him with others.

It's fascinating to me to watch the blue pill mind run circles around the obvious conclusion - she's not loyal.  The reason she's uncomfortable is she doesn't want to be called out for hitting on Theo.  The villian - in this drama - is her.

Conclusion: Even body language experts need to swallow the red pill.  If you don't see it, you literally don't see it.  He can't figure out the social dynamic of her aggressively hitting on Theo, since he's never seen this dynamic before.

Currently the whole world is in panic over COVID-19 and with good reason. Companies are shutting down. People are working from home. People are stockpiling food, toilet paper and Purell. Although I think the latter is unnecessary and just people freaking out YOU need to be the guy that‚Äôs not freaking out. You need to be the leader in whatever situation you might find your self in. Prepare for the worst with out invoking fear of those around you. You need to be the rock in the face of chaos. You need to be the one confident in making decisions. You need to maintain frame and calmness in front of your friends, family, plates, LTR, and everyone else around you.

**Situational Awareness & Making Decisions**

Take inventory of your surroundings and what is going on. Your average person is panicking and has no idea what to do. Your job may have no idea how to handle this. You need to be using sound judgment while maintaining emotional control.

For example the CEO of my company as of yesterday evening is mandating people come into the office that houses 700 people and is open to the public and resides in NYC. They are presenting a major risk to the people that work here while 90% of peoples jobs here can be done remote. We have people coming in from areas that are quarantined because they are in fear of losing there job (your average person is too stupid to make the right decision here). People are freaking out and being morbid in the office. Not doing any work just bitching and fear mongering about getting infected and asking people why are we here.

Your job doesn't know what's best for you. It‚Äôs a hard thing to walk away from your job but its stupid to listen to company who cant see that most major organizations have started WFH/remote work or putting it in place. This company is flat out telling people to come in even though we have the technology to have everyone work remote and still do business. In times like this is where being a leader and exercising those Machiavellian skills you learned here come into play.

I wrote an email this morning saying I'm sick and am quarantining my self. End of story. If they want to fire me so be it I will find a job in the next few weeks.  

It‚Äôs a risky decision but I know what's best for me and my family. I know I can get a job else where. 

Being a leader involves making risky decisions. You know what's best. Do it. 

Bad leaders get people killed.

**Update:** My company had to change their tone based on local government. They remained opened until the 9th. They emailed us on 3/19 and notified us several people were infected during the the time they insisted we come into the office after saying for a week no one in the company was infected. Most of the infected people were on my floor that I work on which is overcrowded with people. 

This only validates my actions.

Be a leader.",2020-03-13 05:32:12

&#x200B;

This is basically a long story regarding how I landed a model. It's more or less a play by play from using and being mindful of side bar material and shouldn't be something new to anyone that's been TRP aware but a decent refresher.

&#x200B;

I'll start off by saying that I'm not bad looking. This isn't to disregard RP ideology and game. Same rules apply to me but I get a few more passes because of genetics and good habits (dress well, lift, social etc).

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago a friend of mine needed someone to model for her to do a drag show. I do a side gig with photography and I thought it'd be a great way to get some exposure with some new faces and also network so I signed up. She knows that I am a bit of a playboy and didn't want me to trigger anyone or anything since this is her livelihood. I agreed and away we go.

&#x200B;

Let me chime in that I have let myself go in a bit. I still remain active but a recent injury has resulted in me not being as active as I used to be. Most of my frame is there but I did get my body fat % up to the point where my abs aren't as visible as they used to be. That comes up later.

&#x200B;

Back to the story.

&#x200B;

So I go in and right away notice this really attractive make up artist (Vietnamese/Irish mix HB9 with stereotypical Asian dimensions) . We make eye contact and I smile but I was going to behave and just continue on. Turns out that I caught her attention and she instantly went to see from her friend about me and my story. I don't know any of this as I'm making sure to connect with everyone; including this transitioning thing and I'm pretty sure what some would refer to as a militant feminist type.

&#x200B;

Most of the day goes by pretty chill, I basically make people laugh and enjoy myself. She gets great marks and I network with the person that runs the event to show up and take some photos next time. All is good. **Social Proof**

&#x200B;

Now, since I was brought in by a woman this woman, let's call her D, knows that I'm an attractive social guy and have been vetted. I'm not showing any signs of autism so she makes a habit of walking around to my side of things. My friend catches this and gives me an OK go ahead.

&#x200B;

On lunch, I make small talk with her. **Approach!!**

&#x200B;

The convo doesn't really matter. What matters was the body language. She responded to touch, she was OK with slightly flirty banter but I didn't escalate since I didn't want to create a scene. I took her number and exited before I could do something stupid.

&#x200B;

I waited 2 days to respond/hit her up. I didn't do it because I was doing it to appear busy. I legit didn't have the time and didn't want to make this into a pen pal thing but I also didn't want to sit on it too long. She showed interest best to move fast before some random dick goes into the mix. **Text game**

&#x200B;

Keeping it simple, I told her that I liked her work and that she's pretty cute herself. **Make this man to woman.**  She responded pretty well and we chatted up a bit ( few sentences) before I gave her a date. She took it and we went out to 'hang out'. This gives me an in to see where she's OK with because while she did show interest her texting was almost analytical.

&#x200B;

On Friday night I pick her up from her house. She is late. Nothing major but at least 5 minutes and I text her that I'm going to meet her if she needs more time. **Test 1.**

She comes out looking really made up. The whole package was dressed up in almost a body suit. I'm not sure how to describe it but think professionally sexy with a bit of cleavage exposed. Apologizes and we go on our date.

&#x200B;

The date is simple. I go to a place that I normally visit that's got great live music, it's downtown, I'm good with the staff, and it serves alcohol and coffee so it's good for everything really. I'm in good spirits and we're shooting the shit while I'm driving. I start to probe about her. Turns out she's in a lesbian relationship. **Test 2**

Some guys would get butt hurt on this and I was actually confused since I got a very flirty vibe but I figured best case is I have a fun lesbian friend that can wing me or model for me. Worst is that I get to enjoy live music with someone pretty. **Outcome independence.**

We get to the place and she tells me that she doesn't drink coffee or wine  and likes sweet liquors (like 80% of the selection is now off limits), I tell her to order a beer, I'll treat her but I've got get something from her car. **Test 3**

&#x200B;

In my car I've got a bottle of black berry liquor that I bought on a whim to enjoy with a date. I figured let's make this interesting. I come back. Ask the owner for two glasses and tell her that we should get to know each other.

Classic drinking game. Stop me if you've done this before.

We share a story. If you've done it. You take a drink.

**""I'm not going to sleep with you.""**

**- Sure**

I'm going to skip a lot of the nonsense filler but I basically find out that she's in a relationship because of obligation (her GF took care of her and paid for shit for her to be here etc.), she's actually bi, she liked me but thought I was shy **(why you guys need to be SEXUALLY AGGRESSIVE AND POLARIZING)** because I didn't hit on her right away. I tell her she's cute but I wasn't sure if we're compatible. She asks me what I think now. I tell her we'll see by the end of the night.

&#x200B;

From touching her hand, face, to her hips to vagarious compliance tests it leads to the fact that I was going to cheat and kiss her. She can stop me or let it happen. She let's me kiss her passionately. I look into her eyes and say 'yea that's not good. Let me do that again.' Kiss her with even more passion.

People start to look over our table, I smile and nod.

She's telling me that she didn't expect it to go so well. I tell her let's go. We head to my car and start to make out.

You can't make a woman do anything. You need to guide her to the conclusion. She was wet and turned on. She felt like she can be a slut with me because I didn't judge her for fucking around on her GF. I was being a man and she found me attractive to start.

Kisses turn to making out, making out leads to breasts coming out, I tell her to touch my cock and she goes to it right away without any resistance whatsoever. Before I know it I'm getting quite possibly the best head I've got in my life.

I finish and she needs the rest room. We go to a nearby bar and she goes to the washroom while I just wait. The scene is not to our taste so we go back to my car and fuck. No ideal but holy shit was she horny and needing this. I'm just about done and want to drop her off at her house.

She tells me that she wants to spend more time with me since she really likes me.

I tell her that she's fun. **Comfort tests**

**So. Many. Tests.**

I'm such a bad girlfriend - No you're not. You're just human.

Do you think I'm beautiful - I'm here, aren't I?

How am I? You fuck with the best.

How many women have you been with? - Today?

When was the last time you had sex?  You're not going to believe this but I'm actually a virgin. (I'm 34 with a kid).

Hungry, we grab a bite to eat. She tells me that she wants X but I give her Y instead since she's so into my frame. She starts to poke fun at the fact that I've got a gut now and I smile and tell her that I'm putting on weight to be a mall Santa. Honestly at this point, I don't care and have a post nut godhood clarity. 

 There are no complaints and I get another blowjob.

&#x200B;

When I drop her home she asks me to come in but we're not going to have any more sex. I tell her that as tempting as it sounds I'm going to head to work tomorrow so I'm going home but she can message me.

I get two texts about how she wanted me to stay and fuck her and how she's still horny and wants me to jerk off to her. I tell her sure and that's that.

&#x200B;

She's now in my rotation and since then I have discovered so many new red flags.

These flags include: Has fucked other guys recently, had a breakdown before, needs constant validation,  risky sexual behavior, loves BDSM.

So I'm going to keep her in my plate rotation. I don't expect it to last but will enjoy it while it does.

&#x200B;

Here's the take away and some of the things that I wish to share with some of the guys that are reading this.

Women at a young age are very sexual and open to hamster anything along. I didn't make her cheat but she chose to go along with it. If not with me definitely with some other guys. Women want to be lead and the fact that I wasn't aggressive at the start almost cost me that notch since she mistook my reservation with shyness (which to her is so offsetting) . Women have flags and it's easy to ignore them when you like them. I like her but only because I can bang her. Outside of that there's nothing really going on. The moment she slept with me, my friend instantly heard about it, she also knew details and everything. Women share sexual exploits. Watch what they do and not what they say.

Text for logistics. I could've cock blocked myself by being too available.  Even now she tries to call me and text me and believes that I've got other women on the side. I don't confirm or deny.

Create a path of least resistance towards a desired outcome. She knew she wanted my dick and I made it easy for her. Had I made it hard someone else would've done it.

You are the prize. Women come and go. I'm not going to lie, I'd like to keep this plate but I know that it's all temporary. Best to enjoy it and be happy that the next guy is going to enjoy what I teach her because I sure as shit enjoy her BJ game.

&#x200B;

All of this and more is in the side bar. Read it. Internalize it. It's got to the point where I don't even think about some things. They just come naturally.",2020-03-12 02:06:50

I wasn‚Äôt careful and allowed myself to get too attached, got maneuvered on, and I defeated myself.

So a few months ago, I inadvertently got involved with this super sexy, super cool nurse. By ‚Äúinadvertently,‚Äù I mean it was just a Tinder fling that I let gradually evolve into more in my head. Not a relationship or anything, I just let myself get too attached by conceding a little ground at a time against my better judgement. Before I realized what had happened, I was already basically pining for her and her attention like a bitch. 

What really got her in was she was (barely) the hottest plate I had but I also liked her. She was super into me for the majority of time. She‚Äôd hang out, and when we weren‚Äôt together she would compliment me and respond right away and all that, even send me a nude or two as she was at the tanning salon or fresh out of the shower or whatever. 

Then suddenly she stopped replying all the time. Then she‚Äôd opt out of hanging out on our mutual days off. But it was so out of the blue and I really wasn‚Äôt all that familiar with her so I didn‚Äôt know what it was.

...Yeah I know. 

Then as I was re-listening to Rational Male at the gym today, I realized what was happening but I had already let myself get off frame. I contacted her first too many times with no response. I had let myself get too familiar and showed too much interest and bought into that gyno shit. 

And just like that I‚Äôm sitting at a bar feeling so ashamed. What the fuck was I thinking? Granted, I had just moved to a new city and didn‚Äôt know many girls, but really that‚Äôs no excuse, I should have accounted for it. 

And no I‚Äôm not a noob or anything, I‚Äôve been RP for at least 10 years. Just a moment of weakness.

Anyways, just be careful. If you aren‚Äôt, sometimes this shit will sneak up on you. We all like to think that we‚Äôre mountains, but we‚Äôre naturally mountains made of little individual marbles and if you let people take a handful from you every time eventually you‚Äôll be nothing. 

But enough of that. I‚Äôve got this hot little Latina from Miami calling me from the end of the bar to play truth or dare with her and her little friends.",2020-03-11 10:36:03

&nbsp;


I haven't visited this forum in several years. There was a time when this place was at once a sanctuary and a well of knowledge for me. Today, I am occupied elsewhere, exploring new territory, breaking new ground, fighting more viscous demons. As a man always must do, as his nature requires of him.


&nbsp;


That is the first point to take away: You are here as part of your process of learning how to become a man. Your society has failed to teach you.  You may have been, or you might be going through a phase where you view this as a great curse, and so you curse the society that cursed you. With time you will recognize what a great blessing it is: an unimaginably glorious blessing. The best gift that any generation of men has been given so far!


&nbsp;


Anyway, I'm currently going through a process of looking through the last phase of my life to see what diamonds I left behind on my first run through. The first run through is always the messiest, the most feverish, you NEED TO GET OUT OF THE LABYRINTH!!! So you're not really paying attention as you sprint down its corridors.


&nbsp;


A quick glance at the current top post immediately gives me hope for the next generation. It almost saddens me to say that yes, I am that old. How did it happen? I'm not sure. You won't be either, trust me.


&nbsp;


When this whole thing was first getting going in the early 2000s (and its real roots can be traced as far back as the early newsgroups... maybe further?) we didn't have the internet of today. No youtube, no social media, no reddit, no self-help guru just one click away. But we had the internet, and that allowed us to finally thrive.


&nbsp;


We were the first generation who went through a fully conscious transition in relatively large numbers. We had each other, a handful of self-anointed gurus of the previous generation (and since they lacked the net almost entirely, their transition was incomplete more often than not) and that was it. The only other role models were men who had gone through the process mostly unconsciously. So they were of no use when it came to explanations. Certainly, they were of no use when it came to the application of the idea of going beyond your limits. The majority of them could scarcely be called men.


&nbsp;


When can a man say he has completed his transition into manhood? From some perspectives, there is no end to the transition. But a meaningful turning point is when a man recognizes how to tame his demons in order to use them to his benefit.


&nbsp;


That is what this whole thing is all about. Your demons within: your violent nature, your desire to conquer and possess, women most of all! When they are tamed and consciously utilized towards a meaningful progression, they make up the constituent parts of what we call a man.


&nbsp;


Before puberty, a boy isn't even aware of these demons. He is innocent, feminine. He operates on a temporary personality structure given to him by his first caregiver(s); the one(s) who taught him to speak his first language, and served as his first model(s) for people. Typically, that means his mother.


&nbsp;


During puberty, his demons awaken. He starts to masturbate! And he is immediately shamed for it (or otherwise encouraged to do it as often as possible to porn. I'm not sure which is worse. To deny a singular demon power, or to give him absolute power over the entire personality?). One by one the demons awaken, in fits of rage and outbursts of violence. The boy begins to rebel against his world, and he doesn't even know why. One by one, the demons are negated, labeled as evil, and pushed back into the abyss of the boy's shadow. This does not end the boy's rebellion, nor the demons thirst for power. It merely turns it into a secret rebellion. What's worse, it scrambles the boys temporary personality structure: the one that has been sanctified by society as an ideal to be pursued!


&nbsp;


Here the boy faces a turning point. He can attempt to reconcile the conflict he feels, or otherwise narcotize himself in one way or another and pretend he doesn't feel it, and turn his boyish personality into a permanent one. Most of your peers will unfortunately go this route, our time is not yet. But don't despair... the first rays of light are about to burst across the horizon.


&nbsp;


What are the first rays of light? The fully conscious men of your generation. You are the first generation with the potential to make the transition in large enough numbers (and to be of a high enough quality) so that mankind can finally shine that motherfucking metaphorical light upon the world, that we have been pining for and claiming to have done, for the past 5,000 years!


&nbsp;


But as wonderful as your achievements may be. Oh, and btw, etch this into your fucking skulls: YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE BETTER THAN US! That means: more viscous, cruel, cunning, and lethal... but also... more loving, patient, brave, and wise. Loving? I thought that was a pussy thing? A man gives tough love to the world. What is tough love? Every time the universe, often in the guise of another man, gives you a stern kick in the ass. It's a reminder that Chaos is always just two steps away, and the only thing it wants is to KILL YOU! More: to obliterate you, to remove every trace of you, to eliminate any possibility of you (or others like you) of ever coming back!


&nbsp;


If that realization doesn't awaken the most supreme rage in you (maybe excitement, fascination, eagerness too?), consider that you may be well off the path...


&nbsp;


Anyway, as wonderful as your achievements may be, they will pale in comparison to the generation that comes after... Assuming you do your jobs well enough, are good enough at instructing them, and they do their jobs well enough... That generation may go down in history as the very first to represent something that resembles man's authentic potential.


&nbsp;


The mainstream declared the end of history in the 90s. How stupid and blind they are starts to become obvious when you realize that history hasn't even properly started yet! The generation after yours may represent the beginning of history!


&nbsp;


But I digress. Have I digressed within my digression? Are you paying attention?


&nbsp;


The second route, the one you have surely chosen--and if you have read this far, if you have felt your demons stirring throughout, if you have understood, or at least begun to understand, then you are almost certainly on the right path--is to tame the demons.


&nbsp;


How do you do that? Unfortunately, no one can be told what the matrix is, you have to see it for yourself.


&nbsp;


That means, everyone's process is radically different. Everyone has a different number of demons inside them, of varying types and intensities. Indeed, after you've tamed your first few demons, you will recognize that they weren't just fucking with your life, they were shielding you from another layer of even stronger, wilder demons.... The only way to learn how, is to rotely start doing the basic things you KNOW that you need to be doing. And then adjust as you go.


&nbsp;


Here are some general pointers off the top of my head:


&nbsp;


A man can become a man only by actively engaging with the real, physical world. Don't buy into any hippy-dippy, shangrhala, nirvana mystical nonsense. The real ""super powers"" (for fucks sake, how childish are some of our segments?) come later. And they're far, far beyond anything the wishful thinking morons fetishize. You can contact the dead, you say? Ooooh... scary.


&nbsp;


Masturbate when appropriate, refrain from any type of pornography. When you masturbate, visualize yourself dominating (dare I use an adverb before this word?) the women you wish to possess.


&nbsp;


You are the possessor of women, but remember, you also come from a woman, and women will also bare and raise your sons. Before you can dominate them, you must engage them with your wisdom. But only after you have dominated them (excluding your mother and kin, of course) should you engage them with your kindness.


&nbsp;


Any meditative technique that produces a dulling, narcotizing effect is never to be used as a regular practice. At best, it is a last resort type of tool, mostly used in the early phases. A way to calm yourself down in times when the demons threaten to overwhelm you... when you're just starting to tame them, they are wild beasts indeed.


&nbsp;


The wilder your demons, the more confusion, agitation, desire for revenge... and other such feelings.... you experience, the greater your overall potential. Don't despair. Don't allow your feelings to make you implode or explode. Hold out and continue the struggle. Yours will be the most difficult and longest, but your eventual success is also the most needful! (If you find yourself cracking and don't know what to do, please pm me.)


&nbsp;


Once you have tamed your first demon (he will typically come to be known as your charisma, your primary talent or skill) the most direct route to get all the rest, but also the riskiest route, is to bargain with your sex demon. Promise him his desires: women. Then allow him to take control. He will typically be more powerful than all the rest. But do not attempt to tame him first! That is the error of the so-called ""pick up artist"". (Anyone can ""pick up"" a woman, provided he has sufficient physical strength. But only a man with WILL can dominate and possess a woman... not to speak of multiple women!) That is the figure of Casanova, Hefner. Men who have made women an end in themselves... A dead end, to be sure (one shudders at the realization of what had once passed for a ""real"" man...). If you tame the sex demon first, he will want to rule (as is the nature of all demons), and he will not allow you to tame any others. You will have no way of preventing this, unless you have tamed at least one, or preferably several other demons first.


&nbsp;


If you are Christian and unable to let go of your belief (it has been drilled into you too deeply, it's too much a part of you), you MUST turn Christ into a bad ass! Remember, he came with the sword. A man cannot love his enemy. That is the trap in Christianity. Not everyone is equal. Not everyone has equal potential. Some people want to kill you, and will never relent. It's your job to... I censor myself before the censors can censor me.


&nbsp;


Dispense with all notions of a quick fix solution. If you find yourself using too many cheesy platitudes, you are on a fake feminine road, designed to trap you. Women have a tendency to over complicate and oversimplify the world in one stroke. This automatically eliminates all mainstream self-help seminars, spiritual retreats, and other such bullshit. The road you must travel is simple and brutal. It also necessarily a solitary one. Any formation of groups promising such a transition are a trap or a lie. The only necessary questions: where is the enemy? How do I defeat him? No platitude can answer these for you.


&nbsp;


If you start feeling a sense of false pride (if you start thinking that you're somehow better than the average guy just because you read a message board and he doesn't... as an example...), you can be sure you are well off the path and soundly nestled between the squishy warm bodies of the herd. A man does not wear his pride on his sleeve. He reserves it as his most prized possession! And thus one he saves exclusively for himself, or in the rare cases, a select few he deems worthy of the gift.


&nbsp;


Don't buy into any bullshit, one size fits all, diet program, all the carnivore diets included. Listen to your body, feed it what it desires, stick to wholesome food (meat, fish, whole grain, green vegetables etc.). Children eat candy and random bullshit. You're becoming a man, start eating like one. (Learn to cook!)


&nbsp;


Eat quickly. Scarf your food down. Eat on the go. A man does not kill so he can eat. He kills so his women and sons may eat. He eats so that he can kill.


&nbsp;


Pleasure is only worthwhile as a celebration (not a reward, a man does not manipulate himself!) of a difficult overcoming, a conquest.


&nbsp;


Anyone who makes the preceding list into some form of holy commandments is the one I despise most of all. You are on your own here! What was written here is merely a pointer, perhaps a point of departure. Adapt everything to your particular needs. The most distinctive feature of man is his creativity and adaptability. Anyone who calls for this post to be ""sidebar material"" has missed the point entirely. I do not consent to this post becoming side bar material, or being elevated in any way, except for the result of a natural upvote process. I do not condone any idolization of any philosophy, man, or idea. Dogmas and helpful attitudes are narcotics for the herd.


&nbsp;


I have given you this gift because I see your potential. Prove me right by going even further. Prove your indolence, cynicism and apathy by achieving any less.


&nbsp;

Lucky to find TRP at a young age, I've lurked for \~6 months, been lifting for 3 years and put what I read into practice to good effect for a few months now.

I believe that generation Z is, overall, shaping out to be the most aware recent generation.

Recently, the concept of ""[simps/simping](https://metro.co.uk/2020/01/04/what-is-simping-and-what-is-a-simp-12001620/)"" as a derogatory term has been popularised online. While it's hyperbolic, it is easy to see similarities with sidebar material. 

From the linked article, a simp: 

* Puts females before themselves. 
* Will quickly defend a female
* Has no game when coming to females so they only try to impress them by doing everything for them and lets females walk over them.

These align with the following fundamental principles:

* Listen to Patrice O'Neal (RIP) on prioritising ""[himself, his career, his mother, and then her](https://youtu.be/PWcMqM9_kbs?t=204)""
* The ""simp"" defends a woman in an attempt to appeal to her as a beta protector
* This is pretty explicit, the ""simp"" lacks game and loses frame easily 

Enter Felix ""PewDiePie"" Kjellberg. He's a Swedish YouTuber, who began playing games and moved to comedic formatted shows. As the [most subscribed non-company YouTuber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-subscribed_YouTube_channels), he's under intense scrutiny from mainstream media who describe him as ""[flirting with alt-right culture](https://www.vox.com/2018/12/13/18136253/pewdiepie-vs-tseries-links-to-white-supremacist-alt-right-redpill)"" so he walks a tightrope when producing content. 

Today, he uploaded a video titled ""[NEVER call me a SIMP!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJMQjF6I4Bw)"", about the recent meme. The video is tongue in cheek targeted at a gen Z audience and will likely reach over five million viewers over the next few days. I am not suggesting that PewDiePie is aware of/alludes to TRP, however, of those five million, a small portion may reflect on their current sexual strategy and will search for an alternative. This isn't the first time PewDiePie ""redpilled zoomers"", such as outside of intergender relations when he [pulled out of an ADL donation](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/13/entertainment/pewdiepie-donation-adl-trnd/index.html). 

Overall, the accessibility of the ""simp"" meme and its further spread by figureheads like PewDiePie is an example of why I believe that the next generation of men will stray from traditional intergender ideals.",2020-03-10 09:19:20

The advantage of looks, or muscular fitness, for men is the number one rule here and that's the only philosophy *unique to TRP* and pretty foolproof.

# Too Long but Read:

I have been a lurker of the manosphere for more than 15 years and TRP for maybe 4. With regards to PUA, I never put the 'cold approach', 'peacocking' and all that shit to use because of my cultural/social setting and also because I was too busy working, reading *occult* and psychological stuff, and other activities. The principles of TRP were a big shocker compared to the PUA stuff I was used to.

The idea that women don't need to be 'seduced' but that they will literally give up everything if they find an 'alpha'; the idea that women will easily give sex without much investment from a man as long as he games well; the idea that men are the gatekeepers of commitment, women of sex, and *not* the other way around (believe me, movies actually make us feel that men who say 'no' to sex from girl A are actually attractive to girl B because they rejected or weren't interested in girl A); these are all harkening to the innate, primal mentality of humans (regardless of gender). Only TRP had the guts to talk about these things, and is paying the price for it through the Reddit quarantine.

*However*, the reason why many women and even men hate or disagree with the teachings here is not just because they feel these principles are effective, but also because there are convincing evidences of all of these principles not being healthy or even effective in sexual strategy.

**Yet, the importance of lifting weights to develop musculature and strength is the only TRP idea that** ***cannot*** **be refuted and is pretty effective in preparing a man** ***to be a man*****.**

Yes, there are ugly men who have gotten laid and there skinny men who have gotten laid. But they had something else going on for them‚Äîpersonal charisma, some fame, a skill that had a following, etc. But if a sexual strategy had to be provided for a loser with women, lifting weights is the only guaranteed way for him to feel good about himself, arouse primal desire in women, reclaim his place as a man among men, and claim default state of approval or respect in any social or professional setting. *Just muscles* isn't always going to get him laid, but it will give him more than what the other ideas of TRP will.

All other traits or skillsets are either:

1. effective but time-consuming and go against Nature with regards to the lack of physical fitness (like a famous writer or musician getting laid just because women love them for their work, not their body‚Äîthis is important because viscerally we actually have sex with a good *body*, not mind)
2. effective but difficult and also need continuous upkeep (like developing mental confidence while still having a bad body)
3. effective only in particular situations with particular kind of people while actually backfiring in other situations and with other people (like a really straightforward or brutally honest mannerism)

*Yet, go to the gym, lift heavy weights, feel strong, become strong, and just like that you become attractive to women, respectable to men and live longer to fuck longer.*

# About me

As an average Indian male living in India, I measure 5 ft 5 in and am an ectomorph. In my mid 20s, I weighed *45 kg*. Just imagine how fucking thin that was. After 4 years of 3 day split (which I *do not* recommend) and 2.5 years of 3 day whole-body compound workouts (I refuse to go to the gym more than 3 days a week because I got other shit to do, and I love Greyskull LP), I weigh *65 kg*. No supplements, unhealthy sleep patterns, but I still *love* what gymming has done to me. I always was facially good looking, but I held a girl's hand for the first time when I was 25 and lost my virginity only when was 30. Now in my mid-30s I only fuck 18‚Äì22 yr olds whenever they come my way. Why and how? That's too long to explain (and I won't in the future too), but this post is my one advice to men‚Äî

86,The Plight of Sweden (and other European Countries) and why politics is increasingly becoming a large scale display of sex specific tendencies than anything else.,432,0,432,ff7wf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ff7wf6/the_plight_of_sweden_and_other_european_countries/,148,1583672892.0,"**TL:DR - National politics is turning into a gender war and international politics of feminist governments is basically hypergamy on a global scale. Because whoever they are, they're still women. Masculinity of global politics peaked during WW2 and has steadily become feminine ever since. Extremes of hyper masculine or hyper feminine politics are dangerous and end destruction, but in very different ways**

[https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-biggest-irony-in-the-political-world-right-now/answer/Joydip-Choudhury-9](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-biggest-irony-in-the-political-world-right-now/answer/Joydip-Choudhury-9)

[https://www.city-journal.org/europe-multiculturalism](https://www.city-journal.org/europe-multiculturalism)

I did not realize the situation in Sweden and other parts of Europe was in fact this bad, honestly. It looks like for all the talk of fempowerment (and today being women's day in fact), feminised societies for all their claims of egalitarian utopia (dystopia?) have failed in keeping their women strong and safe. It's gotten so bad they've coined a word 'rapefugees' for it.

At the root of this is a culture of open hypergamy that masculinizes girls, betaizes and then frustrates the boys and men, plus then opening one's borders to all and sundry in the name of immigration, without even a background check. While the men and white knights support the same as they will get access to cheap labor to replace an increasingly ageing demographic reluctant to reproduce.

If you've been paying attention to politics, you'll soon realize that once women enter politics, left vs right wing increasingly becomes more of a gender war than anything else, with women leaning more to the left and men leaning more to the right (the white knights though will always lean with the women). Whatever conservatives and liberals stood for in the past, all that is increasingly being steamrolled by gender differences and large scale macroscopic displays of sexual behavior at the political level.

The politics of the USA at this moment is essentially one big gender war - the rape accusation now the latest power play. The politics of a country like India is also turning into a right vs left gender war, especially if you look at the real power centers between the 2 biggest parties. Other countries are either more masculine or more feminine - the politics of China and Russia is masculine, but the politics of Europe is now unabashedly feminine, and Sweden is the feminist capital of the world. The politics during the World Wars and the Cold War was totally masculine in comparison.

This is a clear proof of the fact that no matter at what level, the reality of the physical biological and psychological differences between men and women can never really be ignored and comes out in actual behavior no matter what politicians want you to believe. **Deep in the subconscious, the differences between men and women influence their behaviors -- even and especially in large scale politics.**

I have studied the behavior of many female politicians, and I find that all governments headed by females or having a significant majority of females in power tend to behave similarly. Often heading to some version of welfare state where the government plays daddy in place of hopeless beta men, and pro immigration to the extent of causing serious demographic shifts. Birth rates are also low, so population average age keeps rising. With more elderly to take care of, welfare becomes even more important, and it becomes a kind of positive feedback.

So what happened in Sweden or Germany and other European countries? A large scale version of betaization basically. In betaization, the woman falls in love with a masculine man, gradually converts him down to a provider, in the process losing attraction for a domesticated housecat that was once a free wild lion, and then gets attracted to the next man that exudes unrestricted and untamed masculine energy and loses loyalty for her own man.

Betaization is closely linked to the rubber band like hypergamous attraction of the feminine for men that are farther away, require greater effort to pursue and are more of a challenge. The attraction to the affair partner exists because the husband has become too familiar, too beta, too easy and not worth pursuing anymore.

How does this script play out in international politics? Exactly the same.  First the women over a period of generations, starting from school, by taking over the educational system, betaized all their own men and boys, and tried making women more masculine. Then when they no longer found the masculine energy in their country worth it, and indigenous birth rates began to slow, they opened their borders to immigration, and not just for cheap labor.

In the process they really let in a lot of 'bad boys' into their country, didn't they? How often do we see women politicians and the media rationalizing or hiding away the evidence of the things they don't want you to hear? Well, guess which nations aren't so safe now as they were before. France, Sweden, even Germany, Holland, you name it. Take a look at the politicians on board these governments.

This process happens subconsciously and too subtly over a long period of time until you look back and connect the dots. I don't think anyone in this process is even aware that this is what are doing, but their instincts drive them on.

And btw who specifically did they encourage more than anyone else in Europe? At least as per the media and social media stories going around?

Muslims. Yes. From Muslim majority and dominated nations. The immigrants into France, Sweden, Germany and even the US (till they got tough on it) were mostly from Muslim war torn nations, from Afghanistan to Somalia even.

Your media is the ideal feminine space. Google up Yellow Journalism and see the characteristics for yourself. By the way, their favourite word these days is dissent, aka disagreement. And they are for some reason very obsessed with supporting Muslims. The overall support in left leaning media for Islam is a huge outlier, with a lot of women leading the way. I've never quite understood just why for a long time (until now) - after 9/11, there was a huge rush in sections of the media to defend it. It's as biased as it gets.

When it comes to underdogs, the tendency of the media is to show that one exceptional case while denying the reality of all the other cases that failed and backfired, badly, and a complete handwaving of macroscopic statistical behavior. You will never, ever see the governments admit or take responsibility for their failures. Sounds pretty much like what a female mind would do right?

Why do the governments and the media do this? Is it a religious thing? Nope, this is all about masculinity.

I observe that Islam is a totally patriarchal religion - I've read almost all major religious books, so I know what each of them talk about. The culture itself is masculine dominant in nature. And their track record of treating their own women in their countries even to this day, as well as the women of all the countries they invaded in the middle ages is well known. If you do a simple search on google, and check out some of the laws and punishments or the history, you'll come face to face what would be actual Dark Triad behavior, the extreme militant variants of which made even Navy Seals sweat. In fact if I wrote this post from some Islamic countries, by now I'd have been executed, horribly.

For all that these women leaders claim, and they would furiously deny this if confronted, subconsciously they're seeking a lot of raw untamed masculine energy that they've never obtained from their own, domesticated breed of betaized boys and absent men. Why not invite in the more masculine patriarchal breed of men who push a rigid, patriarchal religion, who in theory could dominate them with hard power and testosterone? So what if they're apparently known for being ""bad boys""? They can rationalize that away and shame the rest of the world for not being altruistic. Later on this can also serve as a good vote bank. Women's subconscious instincts are still in the stone age, where being raw, wild and more savage was what helped you win and survive against predators and other enemies.

The immigrants who often come from countries fraught with years of war, hardship and unending conflict would of course be more raw and brutish by temperament compared to the extremely politically correct, afraid to offend culture of Europe. Somehow it is exactly these people that the feminine leaders of Europe want to welcome in with open doors.

This has sometimes gone to the next level. Why do you think so many women from Europe and the US even became ISIS brides and then the media on top of that supports them as well? Why not get drawn to the baddest boys whose track record of insurgency, holy war and terrorism, and treating women abusively, far surpasses every other group on the planet, barring maybe the Nazis or the Europeans who conquered the Americas? I guess these women like men who are passionate fighters just because they exude raw energy, but the discrimination of their base instincts stops at that and doesn't consider for one second that they're terrorists and not heroes. Later on they can always play the victim card and get the beta providers and white knights to offer them asylum.

**All this is a case of the classic women being drawn to the bad, raw masculine boys at a macroscopic level, even to the point of Dark Triad territory. But this is not just an individual person - it is a whole country acting on a feminine behavioral pattern without realizing it. The immigration move is basically an entire nation committing hypergamy.**

**The feminized media won't admit it, but they also subconsciously love the bad boys**

I'm not sure if these women and feminist governments even recognize that this is what their subconscious hive minds are doing. If confronted, their logical brains fed on feminist ideology would furiously deny and shame you for saying it even, their own cognitive dissonance would be too much to handle, but their bodies are driving them on what I call hypergamy on an international scale. Curse the evil patriarchy, but open your country to them? Look at what they do, not what they say.

This will sound utterly insane at first. How can sexual energy influence at that scale you ask? Aren't they just being nice and humanitarian? That's what they and we all believe. But just as left vs right is becoming a gender war and not at all subtle about it, so is the rest of politics. **There is no escaping biology, at any level of existence.**

This is what I call ultra large scale, macroscopic sexual patterns of behavior.

But as these women find out, being in abusive relationships with jerks isn't fun but traumatic. It was attractive when they could admire the jerks from afar and have an idealized concept of that person (which is what they actually fall in love with), but when you close the distance, reality ensues. As it did in Sweden and Europe, as it did to the ISIS brides as well. Even then I doubt if women would truly wake up from their self destructive tendencies without a hard boundary as they would rather have moments of intense emotion (even if toxic) rather than the blandness of their own domesticated men. IMHO when your mind is out of control, it's an addiction, plain and simple.

And why do the men alongside these women in power support it? For one, those men aren't really in power, certainly the masculine paradigm isn't at all in power. They presume they'll get cheap labor from the developing world, as the only thing corporates care about is money aka keeping costs low. Paying their own provider men would be too expensive. Plus their own feminist population is not enthusiastic about reproducing, so the population pyramid is growing old in all first world countries - welfare is going to become a nightmare in the future. This culture combined with hypergamy makes a bad combination. Aim for cheap, and you get not just cheap labour, but cheap everything. The very standards of your society are turning cheap. Provider beta men are dumped by the women at one end and their bosses at the other. Who cares?

Now before you accuse me as ""Islamaphobic"" or ""anti immigration"" (a common shaming tactic btw, a lot of women in the media dissed the author of a best selling book on Islam's truths as full of hate, without actually discussing the content itself -- the irony), I should tell you that I don't hate on anyone with a prejudiced xenophobic and irrational mind like some immature child, but I just look at actual behavior and macroscopic stats and behavioral patterns, being the man I am. I even have friends across a wide variety of communities, but despite that I recognize that tension can become palpable over gender, politics and religion. Exceptions to the trends for me are just that, exceptions, not vindication. 

The stats of terror attacks all over the world in the last 2 decades since 9/11 and even before that the track record of hundreds of years of conquest would ought to tell you who has exerted, and who still goes by masculine ""hard power"" way of things. You can take a look at which countries have pretty brutal dark triad laws even today. Right now it is Muslims that can outbreed any other community on earth given their patriarchal polygamous policies.

In all other countries, especially in Europe, native birth rates are slowing down and even going into negative territory and this is a direct consequence of feminism. The hypergamic feminized nations are really at risk of demographic implosion and immigration only further skews the demographic percentages. The very reason why America voted for Trump over everything else is because the masculine has reached a point where it is fed up of this self betaizing, foreign dick seeking feminine behavior. Regardless of how hard the media tries to convince and feed you the narrative, the world is swinging to the right (and to an extent, the masculine and the conservative) again. Brexit is just the latest example. With good reason.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50339977](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50339977)

The rest of the media is on a campaign to DEER it all away, especially on Google. They don't want you to know.

And what about the beta local boys in Sweden and the other countries? I am waiting for that article that will claim they are responsible for a significant fraction of these crimes in Sweden, not the immigrants! Sexually frustrated beta men are a danger to the long term stability of society as well as women as they can end up revolting and doing all sorts of shit to women due to sexual frustration and being unable to handle rejection and their own pent up inner rage, characteristic of Nice Guy behavior. Plus the ones who are actually mentally ill and predisposed to violence.

This is where RP benefits women too, as men who own their shit and have abundance and outcome independence wouldn't behave in such rage or desperation.

So betaization, immigration and raw, seemingly attractive bad boys from outside vs frustrated unattractive betas at home -- the time tested feminine sexual strategy of hypergamy working out at the level of international politics explains how despite all the talk of feminine empowerment, Sweden and other European feminist nations aren't really safe for women as they claim.

As females cause families and societies to implode into hypergamy induced instability, the same is even true at the international level. There is no escaping our physical differences.

To be fair to the feminine mind, let's look at the WW2 period, when IMHO masculine politics peaked. Masculine nations are strongly patriotic, sovereignty is a big deal, the internal cohesion of the tribe or country is paramount, the society and culture has hard boundaries, those seen as traitors are punished and these nations actively try to compete, conquer and win. All what we call ""old school"" - observe that these qualities are not valued in liberal, feminized countries. The result of hyper masculinity in politics can backfire when taken to extremes, as masculine nations essentially die as a result of excessive warfare.

Japan is a good example of how cruel and ruthless they once were during the imperial days. That ended with the Atom Bomb. That I believe was the turning point. Then everyone got scared and feared that hyper masculinity left unchecked would blow up the whole world. Unfortunately the opposite of crazy is still crazy, so Japan now has gone to the extreme other end now, with workaholic betaized herbivore men and a declining population and economy.

Scandinavia was once Viking land, would you even believe it now? 

So hyper masculine societies become too ruthless and aggressive and literally explode their way to death. Hyper feminine societies become too unstable and implode their way to death. **Masculine nations explode, feminine nations implode.**

My problem is not immigration or women or that I am some masculinist supremacist whatever BS -- I'm just pointing out how societies can be imbalanced when the pendulum swings too far to either the masculine or the feminine. The problem is that any ideology, any left or right paradigm when taken to an excess will lead to imbalance and cause severe problems down the road. Heck, even food in excess will kill your health and life.

For most of human history, we witnessed hyper masculinity in politics. Ever since democracy came along, and the masses gained power, politics has increasingly gone down a feminized slope, because that's how feminine minds work. But right now, that pendulum is swinging far too much to the feminine. We're witnessing the global version of hyper feminine craziness which will led to a different kind of massive decline now.

Masculine politics essentially peaked during WW2 when it was taken to psycopathic extremes of genocide. Since then politics has steadily and surely become more and more feminized, and now the pendulum is beginning to swing to the other extreme end. This is not good either, because an overly feminine society will implode into instability and will subconsciously behave in a way that allows itself to be taken over.

In all the articles talking about the result of immigration into Europe, if you go down to the comments section below, the comments clearly reveal the average reader is fully aware of what is going on (they haven't seen it in a gender based frame), and they have already seen where their society's heading for at this rate.

It's up to men to step up and reclaim their masculinity, and enforce standards and boundaries, or allow their society to be taken over down the road by a stronger tribe where masculinity is still valued. Well, if that sounds too much to you, I should just let you know that this has been how men always went about doing it throughout history. It is just this generation of men that would rather be society's victim than the creators of societies and nations.

I have to agree with Freud for once when he claimed all energy was sexual. Politics is the best example of macroscopic sexual behavior. **Masculine societies behave like virtual penises, feminine ones like virtual vaginas.**

*PS : Also, I observe a curious trend with TRP posts - that they first get downvoted and the vote count stays down for quite a while before the main readership begins to upvote the numbers. That gives me an idea of what kind of audience lurks around here. Other reddit users see this in their feeds, but eventually after a few hours it goes down and disappears due to endless posts from other subreddits, so they forget about it. The readership here however gets to see this up on front page for a few days at least.*

*EDIT 2 : Before some guys come here and call me racist or xenophobic or some other thing. I personally wouldn't mind immigration, but in this case the results of a strategy speak for themselves. All strategies don't work all time. In WW1 and WW2, the USA was a boon to those who wanted to escape from Russia or the Nazis. This wasn't the same result. This was one case where feminized Europe just went too far. A solution's effectiveness is known by the results -- whatever people feel or think.*",2020-03-08 13:08:12

Not what most people here say, right?
So often I read accounts of people who gave up their Red Pill journey and returned to their comfortable Blue Pilled ways, only to get walked all over by a woman who was previously begging for their cock, challenged by men who previously paid them the utmost respect, and insulted by randomers who sense weakness in their demeanour. 


I admit, these accounts scared me, and I was extremely hesitant to stop studying the RedPill lest I become a blue balled, beta pussy. But at the same time, I looked at my track record since adopting the Red Pill, and I noticed that it was extremely poor compared to the results I had gotten in all the single years I had previous. ‚ÄúBut this can‚Äôt be‚Äù I thought, ‚Äúthe Redpill is supposed to improve everything about your game and give you an advantage over the average guy, what am I doing wrong?‚Äù. So after I had a series of embarrassing failures with women, where I essentially had them eating out of my hand only to say something profoundly stupid (usually in response to a perceived ‚Äòshit test‚Äô) and ruin any chance I had with them in mere seconds, I decided to take a break from the Redpill. I chilled the fuck out on the overthinking prompted by the Redpills examination of the social interaction between genders, stopped reading all Redpill readings and just did the things that matter. Focused on college work, made going to the gym five days a week with my mates a priority and just started going out on nights out without an agenda to pull women. After four or five months of this, I found that I was no longer turning to Redpill teachings to augment my every action with women, and my game had returned to the way it was when I started, although it was admittedly better as I had matured overall as a person in the time I was doing Redpill stuff. 


I was no longer a complete fucking asshole, insulting women when I could, or brushing them off to make them work harder or qualify themselves. Instead I was walking around happy, sometimes acting cheeky towards them and offering minor challenges, but nothing that couldn‚Äôt be construed as just a bit of fun. The hostility was gone, the insecurity and pressure of acting like an alpha was gone, and (particularly on dates) my words just flowed and seemed to hit their mark more often than not. I had unintentionally built up a roster of women who want to date me, but understand that I‚Äôm not available right now because my Final Year in College was keeping me busy. But nonetheless, the harem I so desperately sought in my hardcore Redpill regurgitation days, was now developing organically, with all of them available to hit up whenever I felt like it.

To anyone who read the title and assumed I was a Redpill hater, I want you to know that that isn‚Äôt the case. In fact, I do believe there is a lot of good to be learned from the Redpill, going to the gym religiously, not being too sympathetic to women, not allowing them to be the focus of your success but rather the byproduct, recognition of the power you hold as a man and how to embrace your masculinity without becoming a toxic hostile cunt, looksmaxxing etc. 


However, there is a lot of room for misinterpretation in the words we read here. Many believe everything they read here to be fact, and that goes for both the Big dogs like Rollo and Vasily to any random Reddit comment who‚Äôs author may or may not have any fucking clue what they‚Äôre talking about. 
This can lead you to begin reconstructing the way you think in the wrong way, and if your foundation is off, everything is off.
In my case, I wasn‚Äôt exactly struggling with women before the Redpill, I‚Äôm was considered good looking by others and I spoke well even if I was a bit of a nice guy at times whose backbone disappeared when challenged. So I turned to the Redpill to improve my game, thinking it would bring me to the next level. 
But as is so often the case, I went from one extreme to the other, and when I thought I was Redpilled, what I actually was was an aggressive, overly sensitive, condescending douchebag who overthought every single interaction. So a break melted away a lot of that hostility and the really important stuff I learned from the Redpill remained. 


I can now say that I am at my peak in basically every regard, I am just fucking loving life at the moment. Not just with women or work, but everything. And the Redpill played a key part in the journey. While I will probably never be the kind of guy who frantically digests every bit of Redpill knowledge I come across (because for me, that just wasn‚Äôt working), I will no doubt pop in to remind myself of certain things every now and again.

**TL;dr Motivational Reflection Post About The Gym**

Wanted to make this post because the girl at my gym reception told me it was my 2nd year anniversary at the gym and it made me reflect a little.   


Not really a story about how I was a skinny little kid who got bullied in highschool and now gets all the pussy, just some man thoughts.

# Fall in love with your approval

I knew this guy a few years ago who wanted to join the gym and get big. On a drunk night he told me he saw how his girl would change her demeanor around ripped guys and he hated them for it. Soon after he said this she left him for a much better guy. This apparently ""pushed him over the edge"" and he joined the same University gym as me around the same time. He came in saying he wanted to look like Brad Pitt from the fight club.

I saw him the first couple of week, 4 days a week. Super motivated. Then he said he had cramps and I saw him twice a week. Then once a week because his ‚Äúschedule is so full bro‚Äù. He had a few sporadic bursts of energy and he quit officially after a couple of months. Around the time he got a girlfriend who he knew was fucking other dudes but that's another story.   


His story taught me a valuable lesson. I realised when something drastic happens that exposes our weaknesses, we have a sudden motivation to change it. Whether it being your unicorn leaving you or your friends having more money or anything. The guy came in wanting to change himself not for himself but because of things around him.

From him I learned that whenever I want to achieve something greater than myself to first realise that I'm not shit. This will give me the solid platform to build from. And then from there set small defined goals and crush them with honesty. This will eventually snowball into something greater.   


Seek approval of yours only because the mirror cannot judge you, you judge what's in the mirror. But 99% of us can't do this which is why we turn 40 driving our ugly wife and 3 stupid kids around the city in a station wagon.

# Fall in love with your failures

I ""relapsed"" from the gym many times. Once it was because of ""stress"" from my part time job, another because I lost my parttime job and was broke and another because of exams. Each day I was depressed because I couldn't believe I wasn't making progress in some way.   


But each time I came back and I fell in love with the weights again. Last time after my gym break, I remember not being able to even bench my weight. But I remember me putting it back on the rack and being excited like a kid again. It was something to work towards again. I was focused.   


Even though something small, I remember having the extra step in the gym because I had a purpose. I learned that even though this was a small failure, falling in love with the come back is what truly matters.  


# Fall in love with the process

When I first started I had no idea how much of my life would have to be restructed to accomodate lifting. As I said, gym was just somewhere to relieve stress and skip classes in. But after a month, I fell in love with waking up at 5AM to make my pre-workout coffee. I fell in love with catching the bus before the sun was up. I fell in love listening to music as I was commuting to the gym. I fell in love with going into the cornerstore after I got out of the bus to buy my energy drink. I fell in love with sweaty smell of the lockers as I changed out of my fatigues. I fell in love with filling my bottle and making my whey shake after the workout.   


Making way for this whole process forced me to quit waking up and smoking weed, so that I can find the best porn that I can jerk off to. It forced me to have more discipline. It forced me to force myself into becoming better.   


And the best part of it is that none of it feels like work. Gym wasn't just lifting weights for me, it was the whole journey to it. The lifting is only the 1 hour, the time before and after is what I really love. From this I learned to always fall in love with the process. It could be the smallest of things, but if you truly enjoy it then the rewards would just be the secondary goal.

# Summary

* Seek your own validation. Don't do anything because you want to compete with others. It won't ever last.  

* Failures help your find your purpose. You learn what you did wrong and don't do it again. It will also help you push yourself harder.  

* Enjoy the process. It will make work feel like pleasure.

90,Demonstrating Unique High Value to Mitigate Subjective Hypergamic Calculations as a Partial Solution to the Problem of Fungibility.,0,0,0,ferudg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ferudg/demonstrating_unique_high_value_to_mitigate/,48,1583594507.0,"SUMMARY: Demonstrating high value is not the end all to mitigate hypergamy. Unique value will make her think you are the only one in the world, and this will cause her to think twice before acting on her hypergamic urges because the stakes are higher. However, demonstrating unique value may involve some levels of emotional connection whether feigned or genuine. Unique value will cause you to stand out and it will be harder for her to calculate the value of other men because you showcase yourself to be extremely unique in her subjective reality.

&#x200B;

# Problem Of Fungibility

I first outline the Problem of Fungibility. In its simplest terms, if A is better than B, and we can get B, as humans, we would replace A with B without hesitation. Social theorists will argue this applies to friendships as well, but that is not the focus of this post.

In Redpill Literature, the doctrine is to improve yourself and demonstrate higher value such that she will want you. However, I think more than higher value, we should examine how we can demonstrate unique and/or unique higher value. This is because as much as we improve ourselves, if we do not demonstrate how we are unique, you are essentially the exact same redpilled guy out there, and any other redder pilled guy will steal your bitch. Hence the saying, your turn never yours. Furthermore, when you stay in any relationship for long periods of time, her subjective lenses will eventually get bored, and your once high value becomes ordinary and she might stop appreciating your once high value when she sees past the initial excitement and her hypergamic urges are activated (e.g being a football player, having cash, etc etc because these are not sufficiently unique).

# Unique Value

What then is Unique Value? Unique value is hard to underpin, but it is something that makes you different from other guys. It is something that gives her oneitis.

This might edge onto bluepill, but I think some aspects of bluepill tools can be used to achieve redpill goals (or purple pill if you would like).  It is something that makes her feel that you have seen her in a way that no one else does. It is letting her  expose her vulnerabilities while you comfort her.

It is the holding of as many micro frames as you can within the macro frame of the alpha chad. To be stoic is boring. You wanna be stoic and fun at the same time. Now that is somewhat unique. To be dead serious on your goals, but also someone who can let loose. To be intellectual, but adventurous. You get the idea. The more micro frames, the more nuanced you are as an individual. Stop being boring.

But even then, these are only external frames. What you want is to speak to her internally. What do I mean by this?

A powerful tool I have discovered unwittingly, is to really understand her and her past traumas which have shaped her for who she is. I think it is common consensus that quite a fair amount of girls are neurotic/crazy, but this is not fault of theirs. Many of them have had traumatic experiences which causes them to act the way they do without them even realizing.

If you can unpack her trauma for her, explain how that experience has shaped her current beliefs, and release her emotional distress for the very first time, she will see you as a God and you have cemented your status as the best man she can get because her subjective hypergamic calculations will think you really are the best (even if it might not be the case in objective reality but it doesnt matter because she is in your frame). She will think no one else will ever be able to understand her for who she is in the way you do and she will cling on tightly. Following which, she is less likely to act on her hypergamic urges, but this does not mean you stop self-improving, because AWALT. (Right guy comes along and she might think his cock is worth more than this connection. But the point is that this connection acts as a buffer and makes her realise the stakes are higher if she cheats because she will lose you.) Owing to scope of this post, I cannot explain easily how exactly you unpack trauma and reframe her beliefs and explain herself to her, and I can already forsee people labelling this as being an emotional tampon (which it sort of is except you are doing it in the right way that makes her get even more tingles).

What is most important is to forge a real connection with the connection of selves. Game is necessary, but I think game is not substantial and is only useful for short term fuckboi mating strategies. That said, reserve this for FWBs or an LTR that is worthy. And for the love of God, never give away your LTR commitment too easily.

# Final Notes and Word of Caution

If it isn't obvious, please be selective who you do this to. If she truly is extremely psycho, it might not be worth trying to show her the light because it will be too difficult and she might cling on overly tightly to you. The broad idea is to connect on something substantial that makes her feel like her existence means something in a way she has never felt before.

As a critique of the redpill, I think a consequent of truly internalising abundance will mean that it becomes extremely hard to forge connections and this becomes even harder when you understand the nature of hypergamy. I think it is possible to accommodate some emotional connections within the sphere of the redpill without turning into a complete beta.

This is essentially also mastery of the Rollo's conception of the nice guy-asshole spectrum. Too asshole and too alpha and you'll only fuck her but she wouldn't want something else from you. It might even be difficult to spin her as a plate. True mastery of the niceguy-asshole spectrum is the way to go such that she willingly accepts her status of a plate as she wishes to ascend the ranks. From here, you decide what you want to achieve. This is just a tool, the goal is determined by you.

To be clear, this is done with the general frame of being Alpha. This teaches the aspect of being tender in the correct way. Women ultimately want a man who is both alpha and beta simultaneously, and this is ultimately unique. ",2020-03-07 15:21:47

My friend is married with two very young children. He is a textbook extrovert. He had an active bachelor life, never a problem getting women. He wasn't RP, he just did MANY RP things without realizing it. He has an almost magical ability to get people to follow him and subscribe to his ideas. He lies very easily and convincingly. He has the dark triad down pat. Since childhood, he has created a number of memes (Dawkins definition, not internet definition) within our friends group that stuck for months. On top of that, he rakes in a comfortable six-figure salary in the finance field.

But the curious thing about this man, who I consider a brother, is that he's never wanted to be a leader. The thought turns him off. And he has always gone for women he could be submissive with. ""Alpha in the streets, beta in the sheets,"" doesn't quite describe it. More like beta in the house as soon as he steps through the door.

His wife comes from money. Big family, not divorced. She is, for the purpose of this discussion, otherwise a typical woman. A little more neurotic than most, but typical nonetheless. She took a high turnover job that she was doing when they met. She stopped doing that job because it was ""stressful"" (and really it is, but c'mon, could you imagine quitting), and stayed home to take care of the kids. But her quitting predates the pregnancy.

____

Lat year my friend had a tragedy in his family, the kind that will weaken any man. Most women will allow you to be weak for 1, maybe 2 days. But in him this persisted. And eventually he displayed the **ultimate form of weakness**: he considered suicide. Even worse, he told her. 

So she did what women do and dragged him to a couples therapist where most of the time was spent with her berating and ""venting"" about him. And, he tells me, they would always come back from therapy seemingly worse than when they began. This is a stereotype that I think we've heard about  a lot. I was very disheartened to see it play out so clearly, so close to home. And I'm not even kidding, you could have scripted it. Really saddening stuff.

So of course she did what any woman does when she sees her man hit rock bottom for a prolonged period of time. She supported him throughout in a very nurturing way and built him back up. 

Ha. Come on. 

No, she kicked him out. He is now simply waiting for the other shoe to drop. 

___

So what I'm seeing is possession on both sides. She is the one making all the decisions and she has simply switched off to him. There is no getting through to her. She has somehow turned his thoughts of self harm against him and made it about her. You know what I'm talking about. When a girl gets to that point, becomes that brick wall. She becomes a stranger. It's a terrifying thing to go through if you've never seen it before. That's her animus possession.

And he, he is reduced to begging. He wants to ""fight"" for her. He is purely following his emotions. He is talking too much. He is a shadow of who he was, taking a one-two punch of his family tragedy early, and now this new tragedy. His anima is in charge.

___

Underlying this is a jarring reality: I have looked up to this man my whole life. I have mimicked and copied some of the things he does as an example, with some really good success. This is a guy who has made the right moves since day 1. While I was fucking around with my head in the clouds, making mistake after mistake, he always -almost naturally- knew the right thing to do.

Now I am worried about him. I am worried about losing my brother. And he has already been seeing therapists all year, both on his own and the couple. I think I might be the only one on his side, because I know that despite all his genius he has never been here before and doesn't know what to do. And that's why he is making the wrong moves. If I didn't now what I know, my reaction would also be to distance myself because no one likes a downer. But I know everyone else is doing that. 

After the shoe does drop, I'm going to try to guide him correctly. But I've only ever rescued myself from the anima before. It took months, almost a year. I just need him to not fucking kill himself.",2020-03-05 01:59:24

# The good and bad news are the same‚Äî it works.

I've always been a bell curve kind of dude. Average height, dick, not autistic, not ultra funny, a 'good friend', invisible to some, etc. I had '*girlfriends*' in secondary school but didn't get laid until my 21st birthday.

Luckily I intuited the value of monk mode long before I found trp. A lot of us do, the idea has a certain self-evident truth to it. Frustrated and misinformed, I gave up on chicks from 21-26, but crucially not on my life. I obsessed about it, graduated, started a business, failed a business, sold one, paid off my debts, and just worked a lot.

I firmly believe that if you keep your head down, work hard, and develop fiscal responsibility, you will become affluent.

Present day I have a 6 figure job that is effortless. I have my own my own place in a gentrified area of a tip-of-your-tongue global city, and spent the last 4 nights fucking different chicks and falling asleep before midnight.

I am 28 now, and feel like a king of sluts.

&#x200B;

# The king of shit

We tell young men all of the time to not live for chicks. Live for yourself. Be your own center, etc.

This is great. I mean, it would be great if people could pull it off. And the issue isn't that no one listens. They do, they (we) just cant really move the needle on our own value system.

The fact of the matter is that, if you obsess about money, you will actually get it. It's just not that hard. Women though? A good woman is so hard to find, it seems like they almost don't exist. Which is because they don't exist. It's the perfect dream.

And how could a young man with the world in front of him resist the fantasy of the perfect woman? Accordingly I think the live-for-yourself bullshit inevitably fails. It just can't compete with fantasy‚Äî some of which quite usefully informs our other ambitions. It's silly to triage fantasy into good and bad.

&#x200B;

# ""Wait, I want to be the king of sluts.""

This is the easy part. Men have it easy.

There is nothing on heaven or earth that will get an ogre chick laid. But men these days are so artsy, so rampantly doused in faggotry, if you have your shit together and your shoulders back, you will become the king of sluts if you want it. It's not a noble prize, and it's insanely overrated. Then again, this is really only evident when your dick is lodged in some chicks throat.

>If this seems out of reach, you haven't done your time in monk mode‚Äî  
>  
>‚Ä¢ You don't have enough money  
>  
>‚Ä¢ You don't have enough confidence  
>  
>‚Ä¢ You don't have stability

20-something chicks are so drawn to stability I'm surprised they aren't out fucking concrete slabs.

Ive wanted to plug chicks so long, it took me a while to realize I could. I was drunk with power for a minute, and I've since realized that the hunt continues.

I just wanted to shout against the wind for a minute saying it's really not all that it's cracked up to be. I feel the best when I am working on my home‚Äî building something. To this end the point I want to share:

# The first‚Äî

I've seen a lot of posts about vetting recently and holy shit that's a joke. Women are a mirror. If you shit your pants, they just shit theirs. Don't vet women, vet yourself.

# The second‚Äî

I know young men just want to get it wet, and that idea isn't going anywhere no matter how many of us say it's not all it's cracked up to be.

My thought is don't waste your time learning game. Don't waste your intellect tricking chicks into becoming DNA receptacles.

94,"Ditch ""cold approach"" in favor of ""learn how to initiate conversations with strangers"" without having a goal other than the initiation itself.",990,0,990,fc5hyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fc5hyx/ditch_cold_approach_in_favor_of_learn_how_to/,133,1583146675.0,"**tl;dr:** To get over ""approach anxiety"", learn how to *initiate* conversations with people without any other goal to the interaction than the initiation. Practice it. Then approaching the beautiful women will just be a natural part of your already developed habit of just initiating talking to people.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Intro**

It's Sunday night and I feel like writing. This post is based on my answer to a question posed a few weeks back in some comments about ""how do I learn how to approach strangers?""

As an older dude, going out in public for the sole purpose of looking for cuties then rushing up to them trying to convince them to give me their numbers - ""cold approach"" - is just unseemly. But I'm an older dude, that's how I roll. Others have great luck with it. But many seem to struggle with the process.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**The Problem**

I see a lot of posts here and on / ask about either how to cold approach the pretty women (the ""cheat code"" method); or how the poster has gone out and cold approached *x-hundred* number of women and totally failed. The way I see it, the problem is that these kinds of ""cold approach"" exercises give off a vibe of ""I'm trying to get laid"" and ""I'm desparate to get laid."" Women sense this - they're good at that.

The problem, then, is that you haven't learned how to *sincerely and naturally initiate* a conversation with someone. You get butterflies, your palms sweat, your voice chokes in your throat, your eyes get shifty.

Fake - that is to say, insincere - opening lines with the goal of getting a phone number then exiting is an unnatural way of going about meeting your next future ex wife. It will have you unnaturally pushing the conversationg toward the number close - your unspoken goal - rather than having a natural end to the convo that may or may not have you deciding to accept her number.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**The Natural Way to Meet People**

Take this wisdom from my 50+ years of breathing: you have to want to meet and learn about new people, sincerely. I was blessed with an uncle who could talk to anyone - literally he spoke with governors and big-city mayors and men of importance on a daily basis, but would take 20 minutes to discuss the night's sports game with the guy taking the tickets or parking his car. I asked him his secret once and he told me that he just genuinely likes meeting new people. No purpose, no hidden agenda, in talking with people other than that.

This can be learned, because when I was younger, ""other people"" were just nuisances or there to be exploited. Now I see the wisdom in meeting them, learning about them, getting to know them even if for a brief 30 second fun chat. *I've become that man who can start a conversation with anyone about anything or nothing at all.*

But it has taken years of practice before it felt natural and sincere.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**What Is this New Theory, Do Not Read This?**

It's not a new theory you silly reader. ""Approach anxiety"" comes from putting too much pressure on the incipient relationship *before it's even begun.* Gotta get the digits - Gotta get the digits - Gotta get the digits.

I was at a networking event back in \[my old city\] and some random dude zooms through all the little groups shoving his business card into everyone's hands, then books it out of there. He had learned that if you trade digits, you're succeeding. But did he get the business equivalent of ""laid"" from those insincere digit exchanges? Of course not, nobody knew anything about him, why would they send him business?

""Cold approach for digits"" is an *outcome* based way of meeting someone, and it requires that stranger to meet the expectations you've created for the relationship, but haven't told them about. And when they don't meet those unspoken expectations that you haven't told them about, you get disappointed. Approach anxiety comes from anticipating that disappointment (also known as rejection) because the number of disappointing outcomes starts to pile up quickly.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**What If I Told You Your Success Rate Could Be 100%?**

So what to do? Come at it from a different perspective, that is, learn how to *initiate* conversations. That's it. That's your goal. Don't worry about the digits, don't worry about what you're going to talk about three minutes into the convo, don't worry about *just the right moment* to ask for the digits. That will happen.

When your goal is to *initiate* rather than number-close, you win \*every single time you initiate\*!

Just learn how to initiate. *With anyone and everyone.* That's an important part of it. Not just the pretties, but the store clerks, the bus driver, the guy taking your ticket as you go into the hockey game, the waitress, the lady standing next to you looking for eggs in the store (""When did buying eggs get so complicated?"" and lolz ensue).

Why? Because do this 10,000 times like I have and it becomes second nature. *Initiate* mini-conversations everywhere, and you'll find yourself doing it without even thinking. Woman I'm going out with now rolls her eyes when she sees me gearing up to initiate - but she loves the social proof that I know someone *everywhere we go* after years of doing this in my new hometown.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**How, Dude?**

Glad you asked.

Talk to everybody. *Everybody!* Even if it's just  ""have a nice day"" to the checkout lady at the supermarket, say something to a stranger every chance you get just to get used to *initiating* talking to strangers and getting out of your head and past that lump in your throat and that rush of adrenaline that stops you from talking to strangers. Inure your body to it and it will eventually stop happening - you'll train yourself to not react when you're about to initiate.

Learn how to do it in a natural setting; that is to say, in every day affairs. It's normal to talk to the cashier at the grocery about your groceries; it's not normal to run up to a pretty girl at random and start talking (remember that dude rushing around passing out his business card - was that you ""cold approaching"" last week?). Having some canned chatter that's appropriate to a dozen circumstances is great; even better is if you learn to improv based on your then-present circumstances.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Here's Some Bullet Points Because People Like Bullet Points**

By ""canned chatter"" I don't mean a corny opening line that you use on everyone. ""Chatter"" has to be (a) situationally appropriate, (b) get their attention and interest, *and* (c) be geared to get a response. All three.

Examples of *initiating* a conversation (and please, \*smile\* when you say this):

* To a cashier: ""I'll bet I'm the \[rudest/funniest/best looking\] person to come through your line today"". This will get you a minute or so of banter.
* To the guy taking your ticket: ""I sure hope \[our team\] can beat \[rival team\] tonight"" (yeah, that simple - you just started a convo with a stranger, man!). This will get you anywhere from a minute to three hours of banter.
* What's  your favorite team? If you see someone with a ball cap or shirt with your team's logo on it, smile and say ""Go \[your team\]"" and when they  smile back, ask about the team - how are they going to be this year, boy  they stunk last year, do you think they'll beat \[rival\] next week, how's the new coach going to work out?  Likewise, if someone is wearing your team's rival's logo, smile at them  and say ""Boo \[rival\]!"" and have the similar conversation.
* Two  ladies at the tea shop the other day had the same unusual color shirt  on - me, walking past them: ""Did you two coordinate outfits to look nice  for me today?"" Smile! They said some clever response, and we all moved on with our lives.
* To the waitress last night, ""Big crowd tonight, huh? You would think the cold would keep people at home."" Chatter chatter smile chatter.
* Girl  in line behind you at the store wearing yoga pants, ""what's your favorite yoga pose?"" They \*always\* answer that one. Tell 'em ""that's  easy, pick a harder one!""

Talk to men and women, young and old, pretty or ugly. It's all about practice and comfort to desensitize your body from that jolt of anxiety you get right when you formulate the idea to inititate. Learn how to initiate and it will become second nature.

You  get the idea - it's not ""pickup lines""; it's just having something clever to say to start them talking with you. Talk for a minute then exit the convo.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**But Do Not Read This, How Do I Get The Precious Digits?**

That's for another post. For now, I'll say it again - go out there and practice *initiating* as your goal, not having a stranger fulfil some unspoken requirement you've put on them which then results in multiple ""failures"". As soon as you open your mouth to instigate some chatter, you've already won, Champ!",2020-03-02 10:57:55

First of all, here is the link to our Reading Group :   [https://www.trp.red/feed/t/plato](https://www.trp.red/feed/t/plato) 

This is an initiative from two [TRP.RED](https://TRP.RED) members LeashedDoggie(me) and Bukharin.

At first, we just wanted to read Plato's Republic between ourselves and exchange notes.  However, once we joined [TRP.RED](https://TRP.RED), we found the website really fun and saw that we could use the tribe feature to find even more people who would be interested in reading this classic with us. At this point, I would like to thank u/Redpillschool for giving us this capability. We are really greatful and look forward to the forums.

We managed to find 12 other [TRP.RED](https://TRP.RED) members who are currently reading the book with us. We also had the honor of u/Gaylubeoil joining and reading the book with us.

&#x200B;

How it works?

Well, every week we start off by reading a Book from the Republic (currently at Book 3) as well as consult university lectures you can find links to in our sidebar. We then have to post a short text sharing our notes and observations with the rest of the group every Friday. On Saturdays and Sundays we all have the opportunity to discuss our notes with each other and on Sunday I post a general feedback post summing everything up.

On Sundays we also have a fun little game called ""the purge"" where people who contacted me and told me they cannot contribute anymore get to choose how their character gets killed off. This is of course done in a friendly way and these members get to stay in the group as audience and participate without having to submit anything.

How to join?

In fact, everyone can just join in here as subscribers, read the book and the notes we post without posting themselves:  [https://www.trp.red/feed/t/plato](https://www.trp.red/feed/t/plato) 

Still, we would very much appreciate getting the chance to get to know more of you, so if anyone here would like to read Plato's Republic with us and share your notes and thoughts with the rest of the group then please contact me, LeashedDoggie or Bukharin over in [TRP.RED](https://TRP.RED) and we will make it happen.

For the week beginning today you just have to read Book 1 and Book 2 and message a 500 word summary text of both books to LeashedDoggie on [TRP.RED](https://TRP.RED). Check our tribe here and read the submissions of our contributors  [https://www.trp.red/feed/t/plato](https://www.trp.red/feed/t/plato)  for examples of how your text could look like.

Thank you for reading. We look forward to meeting you over at [TRP.RED](https://TRP.RED)

Women are interested in the concrete; Men are interested in the abstract

---



Women and men have evolved to serve very different societal roles, that much I'm sure you are already well aware of. I do see however, no shortage of men, even on this sub, who still feel as if female behavior is somehow vindictive and malicious. A lot of you, it seems, are confused about why women act with an almost animal-like selfishness and instinct for self-preservation. To be frank, these instincts really are primal, and I'll explain why that makes perfect sense, and why for things to be any other way would be evolutionary impossible. So with that in mind, it's necessary to whittle down the difference between male and female thinking to its bare bones and demonstrate why human men alone, from among all living creatures are prone to an idealistic worldview.

---




# FEMALE PRAGMATISM and MALE IDEALISM

To start off, there is a saying, that ""if women ruled society, we would still be living in grass huts"". Why is this true? Why are men uniquely equipped to pursue progress and think beyond what is possible? The answer to this question is simple, and is likely something that many of you already know - women are evolutionary programmed to pursue security and comfort. That's all and well, but what many don't realize is that this is more than an iron rule - this is holy law. It's written into the source code of existence. Women don't care for anything that lies beyond the fog of war of apparent possibility or immediate necessity - this is also why women are not natural long-term thinkers.

And all this makes perfect sense from an evolutionary standpoint. Men can afford to take risks and wonder at the possibility of the apparently impossible - the men who have are the ones who have passed on their genes. Now put yourself in the shoes of a woman for a moment - women are inherently ***terrified of everything***. And again, this makes perfect sense - the moment you are a woman and you stop being terrified, is the moment you do something stupid and get killed, or excommunicated from the tribe, which typically also meant death. Women are biologically programmed to be scared to death of everything, and this is the engine that drives them forward - every single cognitive function a woman has, is in service of, first and foremost, guaranteeing the security and comfort of herself and her offspring (the need to procreate is second). Staying safe and staying part of the tribe are paramount, because a woman is neither physically nor psychologically equipped to deal with the loss of either, and that is completely natural. This is how every animal functions, so there is nothing out of the ordinary there.

So now for the interesting part: Namely, why men are anomalies of nature. The reason why men can't understand the female security-and-comfort mania is because evolutionary, we have mostly been numbed to our awareness of it (men with low testosterone do have it, but that is another topic altogether). We don't understand fanatic pragmatism, because it has been evolutionary stunted, which is exactly why men are such idealists. It is exactly the reason men so often stubbornly refuse to acknowledge the truth because of a personal belief. It is also the reason why men are obsessed with exploring ideas, fantasies, and hypothetical situations. It's the reason why men dreamed up the world as we know it and built it. That same anxiety that paralyses women is absent in strong and capable men, because they are genetically conditioned by nature to strive towards the unknown, to be fascinated by it, to venture into it and conquer it.

**Disclaimer**: the lower half of this post got deleted for some reason, but the short version is this: women are cognitively interested in the what is either beneficial, or already proven as possible, while men are capable of being interested in the abstract, hypothetical, and fantastical, that might have no anchor in reality. Women are genetically built to adopt these abstractions and ideals so as to conform and remain in the tribe, however as soon as a principle is no longer immediately beneficial, it is abandoned.

Women are generally interested in only four categories of interests:
1. Stimulating (makes her excited or feel good)
2. Meaningful (appeals to her deeper emotions)
3. Purposeful (serves the accomplishment of a certain goal or process) - this includes the pursuit of comfort and security
4. Relevant (relates to her current context of reality in some way)

Anything beyond those four categories, women have a natural tendency to invalidate. **Women are interested in the tangible, not the abstract.** The theoretical only becomes interesting to women when it comes time to reap the rewards. This is why women are, for the most part, interested in art, sports, philosophy, etc. only once someone else has cleared the way for them first. Women are every bit as fascinated by the transcendental as men are, but their capacity to pursue or create it is nearly non-existent.

Men, on the other hand have a tendency to maintain beliefs and interests that are external to, or in opposition to reality, which is also why men are prone to get lost in fantasy and the hypothetical, and also develop idealistic worldviews which get them killed. The chief takeaway is this: 
1. we, as men, need to understand out nature to avoid getting taken advantage of by others, and also work on the concrete steps to applying our idealism in reality, so as to not get stuck in the fantasy and hypothesis stage.
2. Don't expect women to act against their nature and stand by ideals. Ideals are only for those stubborn and resilient enough to afford them. Women are psychologically and physically fragile, so it's against reason for them to uphold a principle as an end in of itself.",2020-03-02 05:59:58

**My journey**

So this is going to be a long post, part FR, part story of personal triumph, part guide.

Let me start at the beginning. I've always been a bit awkward socially, more of an introvert type. Speak only when adressed to, cut to the chase kind of guy. I've always have friends and aquaintances, but I've never been that ""social guy"" everyone just seems to be attracted to.

At this point, I'd like to clarify that I'm a pretty decent looking kind of guy. I'll ofen get compliments about my face and such, yet here's one of my ""problems"": I'm pretty short. 5'6 short. 150 pounds. I love doing sports and hitting the gym, so I'm lean and have some muscle, yet I'm a ""small"" guy. So everywhere I go I feel like everyone is just a giant compared to me.

In the girls department, I've had girlfriends, friends who are girls, and everything in between. I could pickup up a girl with relative ease if someone introduced us, or if we had something in common, like sharing a hobby. HOWEVER I could never cold approach. And I mean never.

At a bar, street, birthday party, work, if I saw a girl, my mind just went blank. Not a sound would pour out of my mouth. I would get looks and invitations and all those things do when they like you, and I still couln't approach shit. I've tried everything: meditation, asking for the time, just saying hello, giving a friend all my money until I approached, 3 second rule, inner game, outer game, everything.

I know what some of you may be thinking. ""Man up and approach"". Stop being a bitch. Pussy.

And I get it. I really do. And I would LOVE it if I could. Just throwing myself out there, all alpha and not giving a shit.  But I can't. I've tried, and It's just not in me. So here I was, being able to get girls when fate just threw them on my lap, yet being unable to just GO for the ones I saw and liked. I wanted to be that fearless, unstoppable guy who just barges in, James bond Style, and says ""Hey, what's up"" like it's as easy as taking a shit.

How could I do that if I couldn't approach? Surely there has to be SOMETHING I can do, there are many ways to skin a cat after all. So instead of going the prescribed route, Inner game&gt;build confidence&gt; not giving a shit&gt; approaching and failing&gt;getting girls through cold approach&gt; get better&gt; get even more girls I went the other way round.

Enter TINDER.

Now what I'm gonna say isn't new. It's been talked about countlesss times here in TRP, but I just want to emphasize its amazing, effective, almost godlike power. If anyone is in a similar situation just please, PLEASE try this.

I used Tinder as a crutch. I had had tinder before, **with reasonable success, but nothing too crazy. Couple of hot girls, plenty of effort, lots of ignored messages**. But this time, I was going to become that 5% of guys who get the 95% of the girls.

I bought a DLSR camera (because I'm also into photography). I cut weight until I had a 6-pack. Rocked a new haircut, let my beard grow. And then I took a picture. Sitting in my kitchen, drinking coffee, no shirt. Edited it a bit, added some nice filters. It looked good. It's a good instagrammable pic.

So I created a new Tinder account, and uploaded this one, single picture. Just some reasonably good looking dude with a 6 pack. That's it. And then the magic happened.

Matches started pouring in. And I mean POURING. Dozens of girls, all shapes and sizes. Lots of 7s and 8s, a few 9s, a couple of stunners. Curvy, flat, cute, tall, short. It was just insane. In two days, I got 200 matches, and that is filtering for girls who are 7+. And a lot of them were actually approaching me. ""Hey, I like your style"", ""Hey wanna grab a drink"", ""Hey you up?""

I was getting so MUCH attention it was like a high. I started setting up dates, one a day until my schedule was full for 10 days. Some days I had to set up two dates. Girls were piling up, demanding my time, and I just didn't have any more availability. And it hit me. THIS IS what being a girl feels like.

This is the attention we give them all of the time. This is what it feels to have a horde of guys constantly messaging you, wanting to hang out. Some of them you might actually like, but there's just not enough time.

I went on a binge. Girls in the morning, girls in the afternoon, girls at night. A lot of them I had sex with the first night, some of them I just kissed, a couple of them never called back. But they kept piling up and kept on coming, and Tinder was still getting matches. I was full of that feminine energy, and thrilled of having a different, warm butt to grab at night.

Eventually, getting a date was as simple as going to work. I still got a bit of ""jingles"" right before the date, but it vanished as soon as I saw the girl and bear hugged them. Talking became second nature. I started forgetting my routines, and questions and pick up shit. And I started rambling about my life. There was a intensity in me, in how I saw these girls, an emotion and energy that almost exploded around me. And girls feel it. They KNOW you are getting pussy. They KNOW you've got plenty of other girls. They KNOW you are good. And they just follow your lead.

And this is when finally, all the TRP knowledge just clicked in my head. Frame. Be confident, and girls will follow. Stare at them like you are about to rip their clothes off and fuck them right there at the bar. Use silences. Don't give a fuck. Words pouring out of my mouth. Nothing really matters that much. Be bold. Kiss and touch early. Go for the fuck ASAP.

She doesn't like you? Who cares? I've got 50 more waiting to hang out.

And here's the beautiful part. This shit just started impregnating my whole life. Suddenly, I was talking with the security dude at work for 10 minutes. Turns up he's a really cool dude.

I was chatting up girls at the gym. Gay guys openly flirting with me, and I'm cool with that. I'll laugh and say thank you and befriend them.

Girls in the street? I'll smile at them and wink an eye. Some of them might be creeped out. So what. A couple blush and laugh. One gave me her number.

It's like a superpower, finally being able to be social. To not give a fuck. To express my personality. I'm more interesting, I'm sharper, hell it feels like I'm smarter.



**Where I'm at now**

It's been 2 weeks since my girl binge. I deleted Tinder. There were just so many girls it was just distracting. I barely had time for myself. I'm keeping a couple of plates I really like around.

I'm finally that dude girls really like. Maybe I always was, but just couldn't throw myself out there. And I feel like I can get any girl I want, anywhere (Even if I can't, I'm not delusional).

Shallow? Vain? Maybe. But it feels amazing. I think this was something I had to experience, and get it out of my system. And it has put me on track.

I feel great. I feel strong. I value my ""ME"" time a lot more. Reading a book, just chilling at home, watching a movie. I have more energy to go after the things I want. I have this excess of momentum inside. I'm improving myself at the gym, profesionally, also starting a new career.

So thank you. Thank you TRP, and thank all of you who take the time to teach us something. Thank you for your field reports and guides, and inner stuff I now understand.

And thank the god of Tinder, for being my crutch.


If you guys want more info, have any questions about tinder game of just game in general, any criticisims, anything, they are all welcome. I really hope this helps someone like it helped me. Cheers.

[Proof of my around 200 matches.](https://imgur.com/a/qM6oC5m) Stopped swiping a week ago. Don't know how to prove it's from the last 20 days, so you are gonna have to trust me on that one.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** A lot of guys are asking me to post my pic. I won't for two reasons. One is, even If I blurred my face, it would still be recognisable, and I do not want that.

Second is, I don't want this to turn into a discussion about my pic, my weight, my abs, my hair or whatever. Trust me guys, it's a pic of a shirtless dude. **That is it.** There's no magic, no mystery, no nothing. If you want some inspiration, go to pinterest and type shirtless guy.

My message stands: Get a 6-pack. Girls are horny and like 6-packs. That is all you need to be sucessful on tinder.

[**I will however, upload the pic I used as an inspiration.**](https://imgur.com/a/L3OZvub) It is VERY similar to the one I used, same angles, same filters, same kitchen, same 6-pack. I'm smaller though. Doesn't seem to matter. Hope this helps.

**EDIT2:** some of you are saying ""HA! Of course that works in Argentina!"". Girls are particularly hard to get here. You can read Roosh's compendium on Argentina for more info. Also, out of 200 matches, around 30% are foreign girls. European, asian, american.

Also swiped in NYC and the amount of matches stayed the same. Point being, again, women like shirtless dudes, even if they won't admit it.

**EDIT3:** The amount of comments, inboxes and positive feedback has been astonishing guys. Thank you all for your input, and I will do my best to answer to each and every one of you. On the next few weeks, I will be uploading a detailed, step by step,tinder guide, from first message to date. I will also add some field reports and general guidelines for dates. 
When I have some free time. 

Now some of you don‚Äôt seem to be getting the message, and maybe that‚Äôs on me. I see a lot of anger and resentment, and that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm after. 
Just to be clear, I AM NOT A MODEL. I WASNT POPULAR IN HIGH SCHOOL. I HAVE NOT WON THE GENETIC LOTTERY. In fact, I got picked on most of my life for being short, small, weak. Jeez, that‚Äôs as far from being genetically gifted as you can be. 

I used to get average results on Tinder. The only thing I have going for me is a decent looking face. Now I could either take advantage of the shallowness of this age or curl in a ball and keep bashing on the internet.
I chose the first one. I grew a beard so I looked more mature. I grew my hair long, because I wanted to try it. I worked my ass off at the gym, until you could see my abs. I found a good look, bought some cool clothes and accesories and changed my style. And I dated girls until I got told ‚Äúyou have this intensity inside you‚Äù and I could fuck a girl in 40 minutes (that‚Äôs a story for another day).

This whole story is about improving yourself and using (abusing) a platform where looks matter so much, if you can get abs and some good pics you are already top 5%.
So trust me, if you put in the work and take advantage of the superficiality of social media, you WILL GET RESULTS. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you are black,asian,tall, short, or ugly. You WILL BE BETTER THAN BEFORE. And it will pour into your regular life. 

Just, for fucks sake, give it a SHOT.",2020-02-28 21:37:56
99,Testosterone is not dropping generationally and is an attack on men.,118,0,118,fawpci,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fawpci/testosterone_is_not_dropping_generationally_and/,130,1582933934.0,"I keep seeing this parroted everywhere EVERYWHERE. Also no one who parrots this really knows anything about endocrinology or how hormones work in the body nor how they relate to food intake and exercise. So there are a bunch of studies people reference when talking about this one from 1987, one from 2006 and one from 2016 and 2007. One talks about grip strength, one talks about testosterone dropping about 1% since the 80s etc. So why is this happening? Nobody tries to find out the actual reason they just assume its genetic. So i'm here to tell you why test is supposedly dropping.

There are many things that play into testosterone and estrogen levels one is foods. With the rise of fast food and massive amounts of sugar injection into our society, this hasn't helped testosterone at all, lean meats good sleep and good nutrition keep testosterone and muscle levels high.

FAT our society is far fatter than it was in 1980 fat actually lowers testosterone substantially and raises estrogen substantially. since the 80's physical activity has been plummeting. when I was in grade school even in the early 2000s before smartphones became king our parents all forced us to be outside most of the day and we were only allowed to play inside on a tv or with video games for a max of 2 hours a day. there was usually only a couple fat kids in school and we played outside for hours. Playing fighting and exercise all raise testosterone. Now skinny kids are the minority, as i'm driving by schools coming home from work I take note of people passing by and almost all the kids are fat or tubby looking down at their smartphones. Kids are raised on tv and internet now instead of a steady diet of play.

A few weeks ago I saw a picture of a huge party festival that was going on in the 70s there were over 1000 people in the photo. every single person was lean and every single man had 6 pack abs Now you go to the mall and most people have a gut. If you want to raise your test, stop eating shit, start exercising, get lean.

ever notice how soyboys/male feminists are always tubby balding neckbeards? I wish someone would do a study on this lol. Anyway I believe this is part of the attack of masculinity, oh you're testosterone is lowering you're toxic women are taking over. Plus it generally comes from radical feminists who champion the death of the nuclear family. We have already seen fast steps to make this happen in academia, religious bigotry etc than runs rampant there, medicating males that are hard to handle in youth because they are energetic.

What movement/ way do you think we could turn all this around? Clearly it needs to happen as men are doing worse and worse in academia.

edit: to the people saying people didnt work out in the 80s and they were just fat slobs what type of dope are you smoking I need some of that. they used to have chinup bars rope climbing all types of sports in schools. people were obsessed with sports and getting on football teams and most guys played. My dad was born in the 50s and lifted weights his entire life, kids were obsessed with becoming wrestlers and teenagers worked out. No they were not the most healthy people that ever lived but they were leaner, were outside more  and eating more home cooked meals, not mcdonalds and sour patch kids/ had more physical jobs/ factory work. Also there is a study debunking the original study that said test levels in men were dropping so ya give your head a shake. BPA maybe birth control in the water is a conspiracy theory its been measured. phalates sure well add that for fun. personally I drink out of glass bottles etc and don't have much plastic in my life.",2020-02-28 23:52:14
