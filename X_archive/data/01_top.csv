0,"Google Fires Ph.D Biologist/Engineer For Claiming -- ""On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. """,5496,0,5496,6sbx6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6sbx6i/google_fires_phd_biologistengineer_for_claiming/,846,1502205736.0,"As reported in Bloomberg, Google has fired a senior software engineer, James Damore, for authoring a 10-page memo (pasted below) condemning the company’s diversity efforts and claiming men are biologically more predisposed to working in the tech industry than women.  According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr. Damore has a masters degree in systems biology from Harvard. (correction: the original posted stated he had a Ph.D, this has since been corrected after Damore updated his LinkedIn profile)

A full reading of the memo shows that Mr. Damore was making a fair and well-reasoned argument for why pay gap and hiring gap issues could not be solely attributable to gender bias against women, and that to understand the full picture, Google (governments and institutions included) need to also consider biological, psychological, social and cultural factors which explain the differences between the genders.  Men and Women are actually different, right?

Apparently, this speech violated Google's ""code of conduct"".   The CEO fired Mr. Damore for sexist stereotypes. However, I would ague that Mr. Damore's memo was not ""sexist"" but rather very logical and scientific.  It simply did not sit well with the prevailing cultural elites at the company who believe there is no room for debating authoritarian policies which seek to use artificial quotas and policies to correct for alleged discrimination. However, there is no data to support the fact that the discrepancies between representation of women in science and tech industries has anything to do with other than chosen educations and vocational preferences.

Nice work Google.  Before you retaliate against your employees for exercising political speech, perhaps you should give room for other points of view which are actually supported by scientific data.

The memo:

Background [1]

People generally have good intentions, but we all have biases which are invisible to us. Thankfully, open and honest discussion with those who disagree can highlight our blind spots and help us grow, which is why I wrote this document.[2] Google has several biases and honest discussion about these biases is being silenced by the dominant ideology. What follows is by no means the complete story, but it’s a perspective that desperately needs to be told at Google.

Google’s biases

At Google, we talk so much about unconscious bias as it applies to race and gender, but we rarely discuss our moral biases. Political orientation is actually a result of deep moral preferences and thus biases. Considering that the overwhelming majority of the social sciences, media, and Google lean left, we should critically examine these prejudices.

Left Biases

Compassion for the weak
Disparities are due to injustices
Humans are inherently cooperative
Change is good (unstable)
Open
Idealist
Right Biases

Respect for the strong/authority
Disparities are natural and just
Humans are inherently competitive
Change is dangerous (stable)
Closed
Pragmatic
Neither side is 100% correct and both viewpoints are necessary for a functioning society or, in this case, company. A company too far to the right may be slow to react, overly hierarchical, and untrusting of others. In contrast, a company too far to the left will constantly be changing (deprecating much loved services), over diversify its interests (ignoring or being ashamed of its core business), and overly trust its employees and competitors.

Only facts and reason can shed light on these biases, but when it comes to diversity and inclusion, Google’s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence. This silence removes any checks against encroaching extremist and authoritarian policies. For the rest of this document, I’ll concentrate on the extreme stance that all differences in outcome are due to differential treatment and the authoritarian element that’s required to actually discriminate to create equal representation.

Possible non-bias causes of the gender gap in tech [3]

At Google, we’re regularly told that implicit (unconscious) and explicit biases are holding women back in tech and leadership. Of course, men and women experience bias, tech, and the workplace differently and we should be cognizant of this, but it’s far from the whole story.

On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. These differences aren’t just socially constructed because:

They’re universal across human cultures
They often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone
Biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often still identify and act like males
The underlying traits are highly heritable
They’re exactly what we would predict from an evolutionary psychology perspective
Note, I’m not saying that all men differ from women in the following ways or that these differences are “just.” I’m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. Many of these differences are small and there’s significant overlap between men and women, so you can’t say anything about an individual given these population level distributions.

Personality differences

Women, on average, have more:

Openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas. Women generally also have a stronger interest in people rather than things, relative to men (also interpreted as empathizing vs. systemizing).
These two differences in part explain why women relatively prefer jobs in social or artistic areas. More men may like coding because it requires systemizing and even within SWEs, comparatively more women work on front end, which deals with both people and aesthetics.
Extraversion expressed as gregariousness rather than assertiveness. Also, higher agreeableness.
This leads to women generally having a harder time negotiating salary, asking for raises, speaking up, and leading. Note that these are just average differences and there’s overlap between men and women, but this is seen solely as a women’s issue. This leads to exclusory programs like Stretch and swaths of men without support.
Neuroticism (higher anxiety, lower stress tolerance).This may contribute to the higher levels of anxiety women report on Googlegeist and to the lower number of women in high stress jobs.
Note that contrary to what a social constructionist would argue, research suggests that “greater nation-level gender equality leads to psychological dissimilarity in men’s and women’s personality traits.” Because as “society becomes more prosperous and more egalitarian, innate dispositional differences between men and women have more space to develop and the gap that exists between men and women in their personality becomes wider.” We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism.

Men’s higher drive for status

We always ask why we don’t see women in top leadership positions, but we never ask why we see so many men in these jobs. These positions often require long, stressful hours that may not be worth it if you want a balanced and fulfilling life.

Status is the primary metric that men are judged on[4], pushing many men into these higher paying, less satisfying jobs for the status that they entail. Note, the same forces that lead men into high pay/high stress jobs in tech and leadership cause men to take undesirable and dangerous jobs like coal mining, garbage collection, and firefighting, and suffer 93% of work-related deaths.

Non-discriminatory ways to reduce the gender gap

Below I’ll go over some of the differences in distribution of traits between men and women that I outlined in the previous section and suggest ways to address them to increase women’s representation in tech and without resorting to discrimination. Google is already making strides in many of these areas, but I think it’s still instructive to list them:

Women on average show a higher interest in people and men in things
We can make software engineering more people-oriented with pair programming and more collaboration. Unfortunately, there may be limits to how people-oriented certain roles and Google can be and we shouldn’t deceive ourselves or students into thinking otherwise (some of our programs to get female students into coding might be doing this).
Women on average are more cooperative
Allow those exhibiting cooperative behavior to thrive. Recent updates to Perf may be doing this to an extent, but maybe there’s more we can do. This doesn’t mean that we should remove all competitiveness from Google. Competitiveness and self reliance can be valuable traits and we shouldn’t necessarily disadvantage those that have them, like what’s been done in education. Women on average are more prone to anxiety. Make tech and leadership less stressful. Google already partly does this with its many stress reduction courses and benefits.
Women on average look for more work-life balance while men have a higher drive for status on average
Unfortunately, as long as tech and leadership remain high status, lucrative careers, men may disproportionately want to be in them. Allowing and truly endorsing (as part of our culture) part time work though can keep more women in tech.
The male gender role is currently inflexible
Feminism has made great progress in freeing women from the female gender role, but men are still very much tied to the male gender role. If we, as a society, allow men to be more “feminine,” then the gender gap will shrink, although probably because men will leave tech and leadership for traditionally feminine roles.
Philosophically, I don’t think we should do arbitrary social engineering of tech just to make it appealing to equal portions of both men and women. For each of these changes, we need principles reasons for why it helps Google; that is, we should be optimizing for Google—with Google’s diversity being a component of that. For example currently those trying to work extra hours or take extra stress will inevitably get ahead and if we try to change that too much, it may have disastrous consequences. Also, when considering the costs and benefits, we should keep in mind that Google’s funding is finite so its allocation is more zero-sum than is generally acknowledged.

The Harm of Google’s biases

I strongly believe in gender and racial diversity, and I think we should strive for more. However, to achieve a more equal gender and race representation, Google has created several discriminatory practices:

Programs, mentoring, and classes only for people with a certain gender or race [5]
A high priority queue and special treatment for “diversity” candidates
Hiring practices which can effectively lower the bar for “diversity” candidates by decreasing the false negative rate
Reconsidering any set of people if it’s not “diverse” enough, but not showing that same scrutiny in the reverse direction (clear confirmation bias)
Setting org level OKRs for increased representation which can incentivize illegal discrimination [6]
These practices are based on false assumptions generated by our biases and can actually increase race and gender tensions. We’re told by senior leadership that what we’re doing is both the morally and economically correct thing to do, but without evidence this is just veiled left ideology[7] that can irreparably harm Google.

Why we’re blind

We all have biases and use motivated reasoning to dismiss ideas that run counter to our internal values. Just as some on the Right deny science that runs counter to the “God > humans > environment” hierarchy (e.g., evolution and climate change) the Left tends to deny science concerning biological differences between people (e.g., IQ[8] and sex differences). Thankfully, climate scientists and evolutionary biologists generally aren’t on the right. Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of humanities and social scientists learn left (about 95%), which creates enormous confirmation bias, changes what’s being studied, and maintains myths like social constructionism and the gender wage gap[9]. Google’s left leaning makes us blind to this bias and uncritical of its results, which we’re using to justify highly politicized programs.

In addition to the Left’s affinity for those it sees as weak, humans are generally biased towards protecting females. As mentioned before, this likely evolved because males are biologically disposable and because women are generally more cooperative and areeable than men. We have extensive government and Google programs, fields of study, and legal and social norms to protect women, but when a man complains about a gender issue issue [sic] affecting men, he’s labelled as a misogynist and whiner[10]. Nearly every difference between men and women is interpreted as a form of women’s oppression. As with many things in life, gender differences are often a case of “grass being greener on the other side”; unfortunately, taxpayer and Google money is spent to water only one side of the lawn.

The same compassion for those seen as weak creates political correctness[11], which constrains discourse and is complacent to the extremely sensitive PC-authoritarians that use violence and shaming to advance their cause. While Google hasn’t harbored the violent leftists protests that we’re seeing at universities, the frequent shaming in TGIF and in our culture has created the same silence, psychologically unsafe environment.

Suggestions

I hope it’s clear that I’m not saying that diversity is bad, that Google or society is 100% fair, that we shouldn’t try to correct for existing biases, or that minorities have the same experience of those in the majority. My larger point is that we have an intolerance for ideas and evidence that don’t fit a certain ideology. I’m also not saying that we should restrict people to certain gender roles; I’m advocating for quite the opposite: treat people as individuals, not as just another member of their group (tribalism).

My concrete suggestions are to:

De-moralize diversity.

As soon as we start to moralize an issue, we stop thinking about it in terms of costs and benefits, dismiss anyone that disagrees as immoral, and harshly punish those we see as villains to protect the “victims.”
Stop alienating conservatives.

Viewpoint diversity is arguably the most important type of diversity and political orientation is one of the most fundamental and significant ways in which people view things differently.
In highly progressive environments, conservatives are a minority that feel like they need to stay in the closet to avoid open hostility. We should empower those with different ideologies to be able to express themselves.
Alienating conservatives is both non-inclusive and generally bad business because conservatives tend to be higher in conscientiousness, which is require for much of the drudgery and maintenance work characteristic of a mature company.
Confront Google’s biases.

I’ve mostly concentrated on how our biases cloud our thinking about diversity and inclusion, but our moral biases are farther reaching than that.
I would start by breaking down Googlegeist scores by political orientation and personality to give a fuller picture into how our biases are affecting our culture.
Stop restricting programs and classes to certain genders or races.

These discriminatory practices are both unfair and divisive. Instead focus on some of the non-discriminatory practices I outlined.
Have an open and honest discussion about the costs and benefits of our diversity programs.

Discriminating just to increase the representation of women in tech is as misguided and biased as mandating increases for women’s representation in the homeless, work-related and violent deaths, prisons, and school dropouts.
There’s currently very little transparency into the extend of our diversity programs which keeps it immune to criticism from those outside its ideological echo chamber.
These programs are highly politicized which further alienates non-progressives.
I realize that some of our programs may be precautions against government accusations of discrimination, but that can easily backfire since they incentivize illegal discrimination.
Focus on psychological safety, not just race/gender diversity.

We should focus on psychological safety, which has shown positive effects and should (hopefully) not lead to unfair discrimination.
We need psychological safety and shared values to gain the benefits of diversity
Having representative viewpoints is important for those designing and testing our products, but the benefits are less clear for those more removed from UX.
De-emphasize empathy.

I’ve heard several calls for increased empathy on diversity issues. While I strongly support trying to understand how and why people think the way they do, relying on affective empathy—feeling another’s pain—causes us to focus on anecdotes, favor individuals similar to us, and harbor other irrational and dangerous biases. Being emotionally unengaged helps us better reason about the facts.
Prioritize intention.

Our focus on microaggressions and other unintentional transgressions increases our sensitivity, which is not universally positive: sensitivity increases both our tendency to take offense and our self censorship, leading to authoritarian policies. Speaking up without the fear of being harshly judged is central to psychological safety, but these practices can remove that safety by judging unintentional transgressions.
Microaggression training incorrectly and dangerously equates speech with violence and isn’t backed by evidence.
Be open about the science of human nature.

Once we acknowledge that not all differences are socially constructed or due to discrimination, we open our eyes to a more accurate view of the human condition which is necessary if we actually want to solve problems.
Reconsider making Unconscious Bias training mandatory for promo committees.

We haven’t been able to measure any effect of our Unconscious Bias training and it has the potential for overcorrecting or backlash, especially if made mandatory.
Some of the suggested methods of the current training (v2.3) are likely useful, but the political bias of the presentation is clear from the factual inaccuracies and the examples shown.
Spend more time on the many other types of biases besides stereotypes. Stereotypes are much more accurate and responsive to new information than the training suggests (I’m not advocating for using stereotypes, I [sic] just pointing out the factual inaccuracy of what’s said in the training).
[1] This document is mostly written from the perspective of Google’s Mountain View campus, I can’t speak about other offices or countries.

[2] Of course, I may be biased and only see evidence that supports my viewpoint. In terms of political biases, I consider myself a classical liberal and strongly value individualism and reason. I’d be very happy to discuss any of the document further and provide more citations.

[3] Throughout the document, by “tech”, I mostly mean software engineering.

[4] For heterosexual romantic relationships, men are more strongly judged by status and women by beauty. Again, this has biological origins and is culturally universal.

[5] Stretch, BOLD, CSSI, Engineering Practicum (to an extent), and several other Google funded internal and external programs are for people with a certain gender or race.

 
[6] Instead set Googlegeist OKRs, potentially for certain demographics. We can increase representation at an org level by either making it a better environment for certain groups (which would be seen in survey scores) or discriminating based on a protected status (which is illegal and I’ve seen it done). Increased representation OKRs can incentivize the latter and create zero-sum struggles between orgs.

[7] Communism promised to be both morally and economically superior to capitalism, but every attempt became morally corrupt and an economic failure. As it became clear that the working class of the liberal democracies wasn’t going to overthrow their “capitalist oppressors,” the Marxist intellectuals transitioned from class warfare to gender and race politics. The core oppressor-oppressed dynamics remained, but now the oppressor is the “white, straight, cis-gendered patriarchy.”

[8] Ironically, IQ tests were initially championed by the Left when meritocracy meant helping the victims of the aristocracy.

[9] Yes, in a national aggregate, women have lower salaries than men for a variety of reasons. For the same work though, women get paid just as much as men. Considering women spend more money than men and that salary represents how much the employees sacrifices (e.g. more hours, stress, and danger), we really need to rethink our stereotypes around power.

[10] “The traditionalist system of gender does not deal well with the idea of men needing support. Men are expected to be strong, to not complain, and to deal with problems on their own. Men’s problems are more often seen as personal failings rather than victimhood,, due to our gendered idea of agency. This discourages men from bringing attention to their issues (whether individual or group-wide issues), for fear of being seen as whiners, complainers, or weak.”

[11] Political correctness is defined as “the avoidance of forms of expression or action that are perceived to exclude, marginalize, or insult groups of people who are socially disadvantaged or discriminated against,” which makes it clear why it’s a phenomenon of the Left and a tool of authoritarians.",2017-08-08 15:22:16
1,HOW TO GET LAID LIKE A WARLORD: 37 Rules of Approaching Model-Tier Girls,4162,0,4162,5fihmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5fihmu/how_to_get_laid_like_a_warlord_37_rules_of/,774,1480453132.0,"**A complete guide to picking up 9s and 10s**  
Today I want to tell you everything I know about getting the highest calibre girls from cold approach.  
This guide will cover: frame control, inner game, and passing tests — which I consider to be the holy trinity of “9 and 10 game”.  
This guide will NOT cover: body language, pulling, or handling logistics. Obviously, the latter are extremely important, but they’ve been adequately covered elsewhere, and there just isn’t space to include them here.  


&nbsp;


**My background**  
Picked on in school, small and sickly, didn’t have a girlfriend until 18. Was dumped by her and spent the first 2 years of college pretty much celibate.  
Got into redpill ideas through the old “Citizen Renegade” blog (which is now Heartiste). From there stumbled on RSD’s infield videos.  
Started going out and approaching regularly. Approach anxiety and ceaseless rejection for months, but I kept at it. The odd success here and there.  
After about 2 years I was fucking a new girl every fortnight or so, mostly 7s and 8s with the occasional turbo when fortune smiled on me. My current girlfriend is a 9, has done modelling etc.  


&nbsp;


**Below is everything I know about getting the hottest women from cold approach pickup.**
This is specially engineered for getting 9s and 10s and dealing with the kind of bullshit these girls will inevitably give you.  
If you’re more into sleeping with tons of 7s (and there’s nothing wrong with that), this might be overkill.  
When I was single I personally was one of those guys who would rather fuck half a dozen 9s/10s in a year than 50 mid range girls, so my whole approach to game is based on optimizing for that.  
Take it for what it is — I’m not saying my approach is better, this is just how I roll based on my preferences.  
This is a long post. You may want to bookmark it and return to it later if you’re particularly concerned with getting the hottest girls.   There’s a lot of subtle points in here that won’t be immediately clear on a first reading.  


&nbsp;


---------


&nbsp;


**PART 1: THE ATTRACTION PROCESS**  


&nbsp;


**1\. Women are attracted to you because you have a stronger frame than they do.**  
That’s all.  
There’s nothing else to it.  
Attraction is purely a function of the fact that:  
1\. you’re a man  
2\. you have a *stronger frame* than the girl  
As a man, you naturally have a strong frame of reality whereas women don’t. Therefore they value that. (Having a strong frame is a result of high testosterone levels.)  


&nbsp;


**2\. Women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame than a handsome guy with a weak one**  
Evolution has designed women to be very flexible in terms of who they’ll become attracted to.  
Women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame (i.e. a natural leader) than a handsome guy with a weak frame (cowardice, uncertainty).  
That’s because women who chose to fuck the latter ultimately had their genes rooted out of existence by the brutal conditions of ancestral life.  
In consequence, women now are very adaptable. They have the capacity to be attracted to almost ANY man so long as his frame is stronger than hers.  


&nbsp;


**3\. A girl can ONLY get horny for you if you have a stronger frame than her.**  
Think of this like a mathematical equation. There’s no getting around it, no cheating it, no short-circuiting it. It is an immutable law.  
Women want to submit to you. They want to submit to a strong man. But she can’t submit to you if your frame is weaker than hers.  
Physiologically, girls can’t even become wet for a guy who has a weaker frame than they do. It’s literally impossible.  


&nbsp;


**4\. “Be a man. Act like you have answers.” (Bill Burr)**  
What is a strong frame? Fundamentally, it’s a sense of certainty in everything you do. This certainty manifests itself as calmness in the face of social pressure.  
Simply put, in a cold approach pickup, the woman becomes attracted to you because you’re more relaxed than she is.  
That’s all.  
That might seem strange, but it’s actually not.  
The very fact that you approached the girl at all demonstrates a massive amount of confidence and social value (either real or potential).  
So once you’ve approached the girl and gotten her into a conversation, the game is yours to lose. She’ll inevitably become attracted to you because you’re a man, and because you have a stronger frame than she does.  


&nbsp;


**5\. Relax**  
You will approach women, and you will make mistakes. That’s fine. Women don’t want you to be perfect. They only want you to be a man.  
You are not physically perfect. Neither am I. Neither is anyone.  
Women are not looking for perfection. They’re only looking for a man who has a *stronger psychological frame* than they do.  
And fortunately for you, you already have a naturally stronger frame than women.  
An example of this is how women will freak out over spiders or mice, jump up and down, scream, and so on, whereas a man will calmly deal with the situation without it breaking his frame.  


&nbsp;


**6\. She tests your frame to test your masculinity. The two are the exact same thing.**  
Women are attracted to *masculinity*. And masculinity can be defined as a measure of how much pressure a man can endure without it breaking his frame.  
When you approach a hot woman, she immediately starts trying to break down your frame.  
She’s testing it for strength.  
If your frame crumbles in the face of her frame, she knows you’re not a man — because men have a stronger frame than women.  
Fortunately, your frame will not crumble. A girl’s frame will always “buckle” under yours after you pass several of her tests. It’s instinctual. Women want to be with the strong man. When she sees you have a strong frame she starts getting wet.  


&nbsp;


**7\. “Listen, smile, nod, agree — then do what the fuck you were gonna do anyway.” (Robert Downey Jr.)**  
Women test me all the time. Women have said things to me that are totally brutal — called me ugly, too short, a loser, etc.  
Most of the women I approach will make a weird face or pretend to ignore me for the first 10-20 seconds.  
It doesn’t penetrate. It doesn’t cause any emotional reaction whatsoever inside me. I smile, nod, agree and then keep talking to her as if she’s being nice to me.  
Eventually, she starts responding. Then she starts laughing. And then we have sex.  
A woman’s frame will ALWAYS buckle under yours. It’s not a question of “if”, but “when”.  


&nbsp;


**8\. Chasing hot girls gives you a “charge”**  
When you’re first getting into game, it’s fine to only approach 5s and 6s.  
Many of these girls will be super nice to you, and that’s cool. A lot of them are fantastic in bed.  
But once you start to get some experience, you’re naturally going to want to move up the ladder and start laying 8s, 9s and 10s.  
This is a natural instinct, and it’s good. It’s okay to chase girls just because they’re hot. These girls want you to chase them. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t make themselves hot.  
Part of being a man is that you can appreciate a woman’s beauty and femininity. It gives you a charge. And pursuing women who are “out of your league” (by society’s false standards) also gives you a charge.  


&nbsp;


**9\. Seducing a 9 is no different from seducing a 5**  
The process of attraction is exactly the same. The only difference is that the hot girl’s frame is stronger than the chubby girl’s.  
But ultimately, no matter how strong a hottie’s frame is, your frame will always be stronger, because you’re a man.  


&nbsp;


**10\. Women will test you brutally when they want to sleep with you**  
When you approach any hot girl, she’ll test your frame HARD to see if it’s strong.  
She’ll act like a bitch. She’ll pretend to ignore you. She’ll tell you outright to go away.  
She wants to see if you’ll buckle to social pressure, or if your frame will remain calm and consistent regardless of external feedback.  
She actually WANTS to sleep with you — but she needs to test your strength first.  
Don’t be fooled by the bitch persona for a second. It’s a carefully cultivated TEST.  
Most men fail the test because they don’t even realize they’re being tested.  


&nbsp;


**11\. Fight Club analogy**  
Getting a hot woman into bed is like the hazing scene in Fight Club where the new recruits are lined up outside the door.  
Tyler berates the recruits with personal insults. “Too old, go away.” “Too fat, go away.”  
He forces them to stand outside for days. He tells them there’s no possibility they’re getting in. Most give up. But the few who stay are ultimately invited inside.  
Seducing the hottest women is the same. It’s a WAR OF ATTRITION.  
Women will fuck pretty much any guy who’s around at the end of the night so long as he has a stronger frame than she does.  
But you have to stick around. You can’t leave when she insults you or acts like she doesn’t want to talk to you. If you do, you’re failing her tests.  
We’ll get into the mechanics of passing these tests in a moment. First we need to talk about inner game, which is the basis of out-framing anyone.  


&nbsp;


---------


&nbsp;


**PART 2:  INNER GAME**  


&nbsp;


**12\. The battle is won or lost inside you before it’s ever fought**  
We’ve said that the only way to AROUSE a woman to the point that she wants to sleep with you off cold approach is to pass her tests.  
How do you pass these tests?  
The first principle is to understand is that all tests are FRAME tests. The entire purpose of tests is to see if you have a strong frame that won’t buckle under pressure.  
Therefore, it’s useless begin with talking about “how to pass tests”. The real value is in having a strong frame to begin with. As Sun Tzu says in the Art of War, “every battle is won or lost before it’s ever fought.”  


&nbsp;


**13\. The “I am enough” frame = the gold dust that gets you 9s and 10s**  
The basis of your inner game is the idea that “you are enough”. In other words, you have value to women simply because you’re a man.  
Everything else is built upon that foundation.  
You don’t have to “do” anything to attract a girl. She’s attracted to you simply because you’re more relaxed than she is.  
You don’t have to change anything. You don’t have to improve your “game” beyond what it’s at now. You don’t need to become better looking.  
You CAN do all these things if you want and they will help you. But you don’t have to.  
You’re already “good enough” simply because you’re a man — because you’ve got testosterone and a dick. Women value that.  


&nbsp;


**14\. Men and women are meant to get together**  
We fit together like a key and a lock.  
There have been studies done in which women smell men’s sweaty t-shirts, and it changes the chemistry of their brain — making them more relaxed and calm.  
Your “male-ness” is inherently attractive to women. Same way as their femininity is inherently attractive to you.  


&nbsp;


**15\. Standards are a myth — everyone is a horny scoundrel**  
We have been brainwashed in our culture into believing that people (women) have something called “standards”.  
Women don’t have any standards — not really. Neither do men.  
Imagine you’re naked in bed with a “4”. She’s kinda chubby, plain face, you probably wouldn’t be proud of the lay, whatever. But her skin’s soft, she smells good, and she’s naked and wet.  
Are you going to say no?  
Probably not, if we’re being honest with each other. You’d almost definitely fuck her if you could be CERTAIN that (a) she’d leave afterwards, and (b) no one would find out.  
There’s a natural magnetism between men and women. We have no willpower around each other.  
Women are the same way. Take it from someone who’s “shot out of his league” too many times to count.  


&nbsp;


**16\. Be her cheat meal**  
You can be a “4” and she can be a “9”. *If the circumstances are right*, she’ll fuck you so long as there’s no downside. Why? Because sex feels good.  
Even the hottest, slimmest yoga bunny pigs out on pizza every once in a while. It’s human nature. We’re not strong. We’re weak.  
We pretend to have “standards” to the outside world. But down deep inside, no one has any standards, and we know it. We have no will, no self-control.  
Hot women are the same.  
If you can hold frame, pass a woman’s test, and lead her to somewhere sex can happen while creating plausible deniability, she WILL fuck you.  
You’d be amazed how easy it is when you get it down.  


&nbsp;


**17\. Stop thinking you need to be an “alpha” to get hot girls — helpful at first but it will ultimately stress you out**  
Your frame is: “I am enough.”  
Your frame is NOT “I’m a badass alpha who’s better than everyone”.  
That’s hard to uphold in the face of conflicting evidence, and will cause cognitive dissonance and stress.  
It’s simply: “Women and men are meant to get together. I’m a man. Therefore, women are already attracted to me on some baseline level.”  
That’s not a hard frame to maintain. It doesn’t stretch the truth. It doesn’t cause cognitive dissonance.  
And therefore it’s MUCH MORE RESILIENT in the face of tests and resistance — which is the most CRITICAL element to getting the hottest  girls.  


&nbsp;


**18\. Cultivate a “reality distortion field”**  
In order to do this, you must fully INTERNALIZE the “I am enough” belief system.  
Understanding it in theory isn’t enough. You have to feel it with your whole “mass”. You have to believe it with total, unquestioning, brainwashed conviction.  
The more you think about the idea that there’s no reason you’re not enough, the more it will feel “true”. (Things become true to us through repetition, not through logic.)  
Use self-hypnosis if necessary. Find every reason you can to support the belief that you’re enough, while cultivating “deliberate blindness” to anything that contradicts it.  
Don’t be a slave to logic. Make logic a slave to you. This is how you cultivate a “reality distortion field”.

**PART 3: HOW TO MAKE WOMEN HORNY BY PASSING THEIR TESTS**  


&nbsp;


**19\. Enduring tests = building attraction**  
When you approach a woman, she immediately starts testing you. By passing her tests, you demonstrate that your frame is stronger than hers. This makes her horny for you.  
Women are wired in such a way that they can’t become wet for a man unless he’s overcome some kind of *resistance* to get her.   Hence, tests actually help you to seduce her. You want her to test you. The more tests you endure, the faster she’ll sleep with you.  
When a girl is so into you that she doesn’t test you, this is how you end up on a 3rd date with a woman who still won’t put out.  
Tests are your friend.  


&nbsp;


**20\. Passing tests is where ALL attraction is ultimately generated.**  
Attraction is NOT generated by pickup lines and witty comebacks.  
Attraction is NOT generated by manipulation techniques.  
Attraction is NOT generated by looks or money.  
All of these things WILL increase your probabilities of getting laid, and make your game smoother and more streamlined.  
But they’re NOT what builds ATTRACTION.  
The one and ONLY thing that builds attraction is ENDURING A WOMAN’S TESTS.  
The reason for this is obvious when you think about it:  


&nbsp;


**21\. Enduring her tests = ability to overcome adversity = GOOD GENES**  
Women have to see you have a strong frame, because otherwise they have no confidence that you’ll be able to protect them and remain calm in the face of danger.  
And the ONLY way they can figure out if you have strong frame is by testing you, being bitchy, insulting you, brushing you off, ignoring you, etc.  
That might seem “unfair” to you.  
But if you can’t handle the abuse from some blonde chick in a bar, how the fuck are you going to handle beating a 7ft tall man to death with your bare hands when he and his tribe invade your village and try to gang-rape your girl?  
Think about it.  


&nbsp;


**22\. Women aren’t built for Starbucks. They’re built for the African savannah.**  
Women aren’t built for the modern world. They’re built for nature, red in tooth and claw.  
If you understand that, you’ll do things differently. You won’t take it so personally when you approach a girl and she tries to destroy you.  
It’s necessary.  
Hot women aren’t acting bitchy to you because of feminism. They’re acting bitchy to you because they WANT to fuck you — but they can only do so after they’ve proved that you have a stronger frame than they do.  
This is instinctual. It’s part of the natural order.  
Innate female bitchiness existed long before feminism. Testing men who approach them is encoded into female DNA.  
When you get bitter at hot women for testing you, you’re being just as anti-nature as feminists themselves.  


&nbsp;


**23\. Eliminate self-destructive beliefs**  
There’s a common myth in the seduction community that a girl who acts “bitchy” to your approach is fundamentally flawed and therefore “not worth pursuing”.  
This is totally ludicrous.  
In fact, it’s just an incidence of “sour grapes” — cognitive games we play with ourselves to rationalize that the grapes we can’t reach are sour.  
The reality is that if a girl has ANY VALUE WHATSOEVER, then she will test you hard during your first approach.  


&nbsp;


**24\. Embrace tests**  
Do you want a woman who says yes to every cock who comes along without putting up the slightest resistance?  
Or do you want a woman who actually DISCRIMINATES among men based on their value — and who CHOSE YOU over hundreds of other suitors because you had the highest value?  
If you’re a normal, healthy man, you want the second woman — and that means you must LOGICALLY EXPECT her to test you hard, and to test you with everything she’s got.  
And you must not only expect tests, but APPRECIATE them.  
You LIKE it when a girl acts bitchy on your approach. It means that if you settle down with her, she’s likely to act bitchy to OTHER GUYS who approach her, scaring them away.  
The higher a woman’s value (in looks and character), the harder she will test you by ACTING “boring” and “bitchy”. This is the way it is and will be. This way and not some other way.  
Luckily, passing tests is the fastest way to create arousal and horniness. This means that, paradoxically, the hottest women are often the easiest to seduce if you know how to pass their tests.  


&nbsp;


**THE TWO CATEGORIES OF “TESTS” HOT GIRLS WILL GIVE YOU, AND HOW TO PASS THEM**  
Women will give you two types of tests — active tests and passive tests.  


&nbsp;


**25\. Active tests**  
Active tests are covered frequently in PUA literature.  
When a woman insults you, belittles you, mocks you, or says something provocative to get a reaction — these are all examples of active tests.  
Common “brush-off” lines like telling you she has a boyfriend, saying you’re a nice guy, telling you LJBF — these are also active tests.  
I won’t talk much about passing active tests as this material has already been done to death in the redpill/PUA world. (Just look up anything on “shit tests”.)  
Suffice to say, the best way to pass active tests is to either:  
a. Agree and amplify.  
b. Ignore the test and continue as if you didn’t even hear it.  
Generally speaking, getting active tests is VERY GOOD. If the girl’s actively testing you, it means she’s definitely interested. It’s also a very easy way to demonstrate your strength of frame by being a charming asshole in response.  


&nbsp;


**26\. How to get past her “bitch shield” persona and into her knickers: recognize and endure passive tests**  
But there is another type of test, which is MUCH more important to understand.  
This is the PASSIVE TEST. This is almost NEVER covered by PUA/redpill literature — yet these tests are actually the most COMMON you’ll encounter, particularly when dealing with 9s and 10s.  
Passive testing happens when you approach a girl and she appears to be INDIFFERENT, BORED, or ALOOF.  
“Resting bitch face” is a passive test. Giving you only one word answers is a passive test.  
And — my favorite — when you go to approach a hot girl and she looks at you with a face of half-disgust, half-horror, and runs away.  
Utterly BRUTAL as it seems — yes, even THAT is a test.  


&nbsp;


**27\. Don’t confuse passive tests with “rejection”**  
99% of guys interpret passive tests as REJECTION. Even natural alphas do.  
And that’s totally understandable.  
I mean, it makes sense right?  
If you approach a stunner and she takes one look at you before making a “creeped out” face to her friend, and then they run away — that’s obviously a rejection, right?  
Well, what if I told you that at least half the women I’ve slept with in my life reacted like that (or similarly badly) when I approached them?  
Here’s a particularly good example:  


&nbsp;


**28\. “Rejection” is not rejection**  
There was this girl I went to college with. Brunette, hot, did modeling work in her spare time, socially was one step down from a “minor celebrity” in my city.  
Probably one of the 10 or 15 hottest girls in my college.  
I always wanted to fuck this girl, because she seemed smart and interesting as well as just hot. But I rarely saw her around.  
One day she passed me in the stairwell, and I thought “this is probably the only chance I’m ever going to get”.  
So I approached her and blurted. “Hi, I’m Mike”. Good eye contact. Held my hand out to shake hers. Whatever.  
She looked at me like I had leprosy.  
I mean, she literally RECOILED. Her eyes went wide in horror, as if I was trying to infect her with AIDS.  
She shook my hand limply and muttered some social nicety back, then ran away swiftly.  
WOW… Now THAT’S a rejection, right?  
Well, the story has an addendum. That woman is now my girlfriend. Has been for three years. She’ll probably be the mother of my children.  
So what’s going on here?  
If she was attracted to me (which she later told me she was), why did she appear to “reject” me?  
Answering this question is the THE KEY to mastering all of game and social dynamics. You ready?  
Ok, here we go:  


&nbsp;


**29\. You are TOO HIGH VALUE**  
Yes, you read that correctly.  
When you’re getting “rejected” by girls, it’s because YOU’RE TOO HIGH VALUE FOR THEM, and it makes them nervous and self-conscious.  
Stay with me here. I know this sounds paradoxical, but try to grasp it.  


&nbsp;


**30\. Women are nervous around you**  
When you approach a woman out of the blue, it demonstrates a LOT of value. More than you probably realize.  
This is because 97% of guys DON’T APPROACH AT ALL. (Those who do are usually drunk and sloppy.)  
This means that if you’re an average to fair looking guy, and you cold approach a girl, you’ve just put yourself in the top 3% of men in terms of confidence.  
In other words, she is going to naturally ASSUME that you are an alpha male (whether this is true or not).  
This makes her NERVOUS and SELF-CONSCIOUS. She’s ill at ease around you because she wants to make a good impression.  
So she tries to act “cool”, “aloof”, and “standoffish”… because she feels awkward.  
She says bitchy things… because she can’t think of anything else to say.  
She run aways… because she feels anxious around you and doesn’t know what to do next.  
In other words: you’re coming across as TOO HIGH VALUE.  
Women are nervous around you. Be patient with them!  
Dumb yourself down. Hold frame, tease them, keep smiling warmly.  
Eventually they’ll open up and start laughing, flirting back, and ultimately get turned on by the fact that you out-framed them in a way no other man ever has.

&nbsp;


**BONUS:  THE 6 MOST COMMON TESTS HOT GIRLS WILL GIVE YOU AND HOW TO PASS THEM IN A WAY THAT BUILDS ATTRACTION**  


&nbsp;


**#1\. You approach her, say hi, and she makes a weird face, or pretends to ignore you.**  
Simply keep talking as if you expect her to talk back. She’s nervous and self-conscious and *doesn’t know what to say*. That’s why she’s acting “bitchy” — you’re too high value for her and she feels anxious, causing her to try to act cool.  
Don’t react to her. Keep your body language open and relaxed. Warm smile, unwavering eye contact. Keep talking. Eventually she’ll start talking back and responding positively.  


&nbsp;


**#2\. You’re talking to a girl and she acts indifferent or aloof, only gives you one word answers, or keeps looking off into the distance**  
Again, you simply have to ENDURE IT. Keep talking, keep being playful. Teasing her a little bit never hurts either. “Are you this charming with all the guys?” “This bitchy cheerleader persona you’re putting on is really turning me on, please keep it going ;-)”  
When she sees you’re not going to go away so easily, her frame will crack. She’ll start to smile. Attraction.  


&nbsp;


**#3\. You’re talking to a girl and she leaves to go to the bathroom, says “I have to go find my friends”, or runs away for no apparent reason.**  
Let her go. Then re-approach her later. I can’t tell you how many girls have run off on me, then I approach them half an hour later and they’re like “Oh it’s you!” and then we hook up.  
Why do women leave? Again, they’re NERVOUS.  
Have you ever approached a hot girl and things were going TOO WELL? The girl is smiling and laughing…. she’s responding well… and…. you freak out! You don’t know what else to do, but you don’t want to fuck it up, so you leave set!  
GIRLS DO THIS TOO. Women will “run out of things to say” and run away because they’re nervous and overwhelmed by being in a high value person’s presence, same as guys will.  
Let her go, then re-approach her next time you see her.  
She will respond extremely well 90% of the time in my experience. She’ll literally be GRATEFUL to you that you gave her another chance. Women have told me this explicitly.  


&nbsp;


**#4\. If you’re talking to a girl and she tells you outright that you should leave, or says “well, you should go back to your friends”, “it was nice meeting you”, etc.**  
Smile, nod, agree, and then continue talking to her as if she said nothing. Never leave set because a girl tells you to.  
SHE can walk away if she wants. She has that right.  
But in a public space like a bar or nightclub, you’re well within your rights to talk to whoever you want.  
It’s Saturday night. It’s a social environment. You’re mixing with people.  
You’re free to talk to whoever you want, and she’s free to walk away at any time.  
But if she tells YOU to leave, it’s simply a test of your frame. She wants to see that you won’t buckle under social pressure.  
Pass the test by ignoring it. If she tells you to leave again, look her in the eye with a sly smile and say “You’re free to go if you want to.”  
Her eyes will light up and she’ll punch you in the arm. Pussy dampening commences.  


&nbsp;


**#5\. You’re talking to a woman and there’s an uncomfortably long lull in the conversation.**  
Stare into her left pupil while saying nothing. Instant sexual tension.  


&nbsp;


**#6\. You approach a woman, or a group of women, and they attempt to mock or belittle you.**  
They’re nervous around you because you’re the alpha male in the environment. (As demonstrated by the fact that you approached.)  
They feel uncomfortable in your presence because you’re high value, and so they’re trying to maintain frame by making nervous jokes.  
Smile, nod, agree, and keep talking to them AS IF they were being perfectly nice to you. If you act like they’re being civil, eventually their frame will buckle to yours and they actually WILL begin to act civil.  
That’s the nature of having a stronger frame: you create reality. Other people adjust themselves to it.  


&nbsp;


---------


&nbsp;


**TL;DR**  


&nbsp;


**1\.** Women value you because you have a STRONGER FRAME than them. That’s all.  
**2\.** To figure out if you’ve got a strong frame, women test you. These tests come in the form of indifference, bitchiness, aloofness, personal insults, etc.  
**3\.** You don’t have to do much to pass these tests. You just have to ENDURE them, keep talking to her, teasing her a little and being normal. Over time, her frame will buckle and she’ll become aroused by you because she sees you have a strong frame that can’t be pushed around.  
**4\.** Attraction is a passive, not an active process. You attract hot girls by outframing them. You outframe them by enduring their tests without it breaking your frame. Eventually they “buckle” to you and become wet, laugh at your jokes, ask you what you’re doing later, etc. Then you can take her hand and lead her to the sex location and she’ll be compliant.  
**5\.** The hotter the woman, the harsher will be her tests. Paradoxically, this can actually make hotter women easier to attract, because if you can endure her tests you stand out massively from other guys. Compare to an average girl: her tests won’t be as hard, so you have to pass more of them and spend more time with her before she can see you’re strong

2,"I have been practicing Stoicism for 3 years now and the quality of my life has increased dramatically because of these 3 exercises. One from each of the greats: Epictetus, Seneca, And Marcus Aurelius. Try them and tell me what you think in two weeks.",3601,0,3601,6s4mfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6s4mfa/i_have_been_practicing_stoicism_for_3_years_now/,178,1502129477.0,"**Practical Stoicism Tools**

Stoicism philosophy is on the rise. I have been practising it for a couple of years now and would like to share 3 of the most effective and practical mental exercise/meditations that I have used.

##**Method One: A view from above**##

*'You can rid yourself of many useless things among those that disturb you, for they lie entirely in your imagination; and you will then gain for yourself ample space by comprehending the whole universe in your mind, and by contemplating the eternity of time, and observing the rapid change of every part of everything, how short is the time from birth to dissolution, and the illimitable time before birth as well as the equally boundless time after dissolution'* 

**– Marcus Aurelius**

Marcus Aurelius advises us to perform an exercise called 'view from above'. This exercise involves us envisioning ourselves from the third person. In this vision, we zoom out while keeping ourselves in the centre. We continue zooming out and contemplating the scale of the universe.  For instance, your first zoom might encompass a view of you from above the roof of your house. Increase the magnitude and you might see a view of your street, increase the magnitude and you might see a view of your country. Keep going until you can picture a view of Earth from the stars. 

With this scale, we can gain a better perspective on the insignificance of our problems. When compared to the universe whatever problems we might appear incredibly trivial.  For instance, if you were feeling down because a girl flaked on you or someone insulted you, try this exercise. It is far easier to overcome the emotional hurdles we experience when we put things into perspective. 

##**Method Two: Negative visualization**##

*'Remember that all we have is “on loan” from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission—indeed, without even advance notice. Thus, we should love all our dear ones, but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever—nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long.'*

**- Seneca**

Negative visualization despite the name is an exercise that will increase your default level of happiness if practised consistently.The exercise consists of you envisioning what it would feel like if you lost certain things from your life. 
Some of the things that you could consider during the exercise are:

•	How it would feel to not have a roof over your head.

•	How it would feel to lose social status.

•	How it would feel to live in a third world country.

•	How it would feel to have a physical disability.

•	How it would feel to lose a loved one.

This exercise is not meant to be dark or morbid, it’s meant to put things into perspective. Allowing you to see how lucky you truly are. It also prepares you for the worst case scenarios in which one of these things does happen. **You are not meant to fixate on these thoughts, but consider them from time to time.**

This is a very practical way for you to practice gratitude, naturally, when you consider things being removed from your life, you start to gain a sense of gratitude.
 Now gratitude is important because of a thing called ‘hedonic adaptation’, basically, it’s a term that defines the tendency for humans to always go back to their default level of happiness. 

If you won the lotto and became a millionaire, your base level of happiness will increase for a while. However, when you become accustomed to the lifestyle, despite all the new toys, you will return to your base level.
 Gratitude breaks this pattern, allowing you to enjoy each step on the ladder. You can be grateful when you own a box, and you can be grateful when you own a Lamborghini Avendator.  

##**Method Three: Voluntary Discomfort**##

*'But neither a bull nor a noble-spirited man comes to be what he is all at once; he must undertake hard winter training, and prepare himself, and not propel himself rashly into what is not appropriate to him'*

**- Epictetus**

The last exercise has been advised to us by Epictetus. It is called 'voluntary discomfort'. In this exercise, we are going to deliberately put ourselves through uncomfortable situations. We will do this in order to train ourselves to not hold onto comfort with such high regard.
We can perform voluntary discomfort in a number of ways.
Some suggestions are:

•	Cold Showers

•	NoFap

•	Exercising in the morning 

•	Walking in the cold without a jumper

•	Fasting for a day

•	Sleeping on the floor

All these things will change your relationship with comfort. Once you overcome the need for comfort, life will become much easier. Setting your goals and sticking to them will be far easier. When most people complain about being ‘uncomfortable’, you won’t be able to relate. You are literally training yourself to be like a Navy Seal. This method will harden you up for life.

 Eventually shit will hit the fan at some stage during your life. You want to have to mental and physical fortitude to weather the storm.

So those are the three stoic exercises. Stoicism is a practical philosophy that has survived the test of time due to its universal applications. If you practice these stoic meditations, you will be well on your way to the good life.

A very good example of the double standards people have, and how women are considered victims when they're treated the same way men are all of the time. 

http://archive.is/k4ji6

A common scenario: a woman becomes pregnant by ""accident"", her fling/ex/one-night-stand does not want to be a parent, but the courts end up forcing the man to pay child support for the next 18 years of his life, most of which may never go towards the child. 

Of course, we are told that this is completely normal and acceptable. Both parents have a responsibility towards the kid. You can't opt out of being a parent. The child support is for the *child's* benefit. If you didn't want a kid, you shouldn't have had sex. And so on, and so on. 

Except when it's a man that's forcing his girl to pay child support. Then, according to much of Reddit, he's a scumbag, a lying asshole, his child is to be pitied for being raised by him, etc. 

In this instance, a 20-year-old man posted on Legal Advice asking for help. His ex-girlfriend was pregnant and wanted to put the child up for adoption when it was born, against his own wishes. He wanted to raise the child, even if he had to do so as a single parent. He said that he earned enough to support the child on his own and he was willing to take on the responsibility. 

He was informed that his ex could not put the child up for adoption without his consent and that he should get a lawyer, register his paternity, and push for his custodial rights. 

Yesterday, he came back with an update. He got a lawyer, managed to prevent his ex from putting the child up for adoption, and is now raising his daughter as a single parent, with his ex signing over her custodial rights. And oh yeah, after this all happened and he had his daughter, he also got his lawyer to file for child support and his ex now has to pay child support for the next 18 years, and she phoned him up livid, swearing at him and calling him every name in the book. 

A very common scenario that often occurs with the man having to pay the child support, but now that it's the woman, plenty of people have some choice thoughts for this man. 

> I actually feel terrible for the mother. Because if she didn't want the child, she could have easily aborted the baby and this man goes, after the mother gives him full legal custody, and makes her pay child support?

> I don't agree with this at all. (+723)

Yes, she definitely should've aborted her eight-month-old fetus to save money. 

> But that was the point of adoption, so someone could take proper care of the child. This just seems like dirty tactics. (+257)

Want proper care for your child? Put them up for adoption and send them off into the world! 

> She had a plan, but now has to pay child support instead because the father wanted full custody? (+420)

> Now, after he gets custody of the kid, he wants her to pay child support? That kinda negates the point of not being able to support the kid. I'd say that's a dick move on the dad's part. She should have terminated if she knew he would do that. (+596)

Another ""she should've aborted her almost full-term baby"" comment.

> Literally a post why she should have put it up, she'd be in much better position. Crazy. (+4)

If she put her daughter up for adoption, *she* would save money and *her daughter* would grow up without either of her birth parents. Imagine how much of a better position that would be!

> She let him have the kid without a fuss at the end but then he files for child support? Holy shit can't understand how someone could do that. And just imagine the Reddit shitstorm if it had been the other way. (+188)

""Imagine if this happened to a *woman*!""

> She was mislead and lied to. It is incredibly scummy and I now worry for this kid's future having a dad willing to so coldly lie and fuck over someone like that...There needs to be more reason in these laws. (+44)

> Total dick-move to sue for child support. She clearly and expressedly did NOT want this child. She made the process for OP to have the child easy as possible. Had she gone the adoption route, she wouldnt be on the hook for child support, but decided to give the father a chance to parent. Absolutely an asshole thing to do to her. (+10)

> What selfish prick. Also, what an excellent way to make that woman hate him until the day she dies.  (+14)

> I think it's a crappy thing to do, and if I was the mother, and he went after child support, I'd go after visitation rights. Then he may change his mind about wanting child support.

""If I was the woman, I would go after visitation rights and be miserable raising a daughter I don't want *to get back at him*!""

> I am glad I am not the only one that was distressed about the underhanded way he went about getting child-support. His lack of honesty really worries me. (+61)

> I'm conflicted regarding going after child support. In my head I feel it's wrong, if she had put the baby up for adoption then she wouldn't have to pay it for the next 18 years. However if the roles were reversed and the father wanted to put the baby up for adoption and the mother wanted full custody, then i think public opinion would be that the father obviously has to pay. The laws need to change regarding this topic for sure. (+19)

""Now that this has happened to a woman, the laws have to change!""

Also, one comment that made me laugh: 

> You said you weren't smart enough for college? Man, you seem brilliant!

And there are hundreds of other comments, calling him shitty, a scumbag, ice cold, and every other name in the book. 

To be fair, at least half the people in that thread support him and think this is perfectly fine, maybe even the majority. But you can be sure that if this was a woman, nobody would've even blinked twice. 

When a woman is given the same treatment that men undergo all the time, she is seen as a victim. Furthermore, when a woman suffers the smallest consequences for her actions, people will excuse any and all behavior on her part (such as a late-term abortion of a viable fetus to avoid paying child support).

Many of us have pointed out that feminists will avoid and even censor any discussion of rape when it is not committed by white men. The famous example is in Rotherham UK where 1400 children were raped by Muslim gangs, and groomed in prostitution as young as 8 years of age. The right wing were not able to stop it for over a decade as they were labelled racist and islamophobic by the left and feminists. The police and a liberal local government actively covered it up and allowed it; in many cases they said the children were asking for it, essentially. An example of a feminist trying to cover up what had happened, even after the story had become official: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7JmVwMNq4c

On New Years eve 1000 refugees were releasing fireworks and brawling. Gangs of refugees cornered women in subways. Only 10 police were assigned by police to manage the situation. There was one rape and 80 or so sexual assaults. http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/01/04/revealed-1000-migrants-brawl-rape-sexually-assault-steal-one-german-train-station-new-years-eve/ . Also: 
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35231046 . The story is everywhere now, including Reuters and NYT so check your favourite source.

However the default subreddits are not letting this hate speech be told. worldnews has banned it as local news, although it is front page news all across Europe many right wing papers, the number 2 story on BBC, and reported widely in America now. A moderator did however give somebody the real reason: https://i.imgur.com/21U1AIU.png .

Worst of all is that the 2XChromosomes subreddit has deleted all threads talking about the mass sexual assaults and rape in Cologne on that evening. The default sub for females is actively covering up mass sexual assault! 

The silence is deafening. Leftist/Feminists enable rape by attempting to cover up assaults. They choose to virtue signal or fight for agendas that make themselves feel good, even when it results in more rapes for other women. It is the ultimate act of selfishness and hypocrisy.

I know we aren't really activists here, but we can do good by pointing out the progressivism pecking order to women that are close to us: 'oppressed' rapists come before female victims.",2016-01-06 04:14:43

**Self-Introduction**

&nbsp;

Hello, I am an Asian American, male, age 23, 5'6, 160lb.  It's been several years since I have started this journey. Typical bluepill background. Typical Asian upbringing. School smart but not street smart. High school was a dud and I wanted to committed suicide during my junior year. Been told I was cute before but never had the balls to do anything. Been an orbiter, emotional tampon, ""best friend"", the whole nine yards. 

&nbsp;

My journey started in 2013 when I discovered PUA, then to TRP, then to MGTOW, and now I'm just a guy with a mission in life with bit of knowledge and better boundaries. Went through all the stages of grief and learn to accept women and their.. special ways. They aren't meant to be men so I can't expect them to have the same values as men. Now life tends to be more.. amusing and less.. self inflicting drama. I am way less thirsty around women and no longer asking 'why' about a lot of things. Instead I now know 'why' and tend just shrug things off when they don't work out.  

&nbsp;

Below is a list of ideals I have come across on this journey, things I have struggle with, and the tools that had help me along the way. I ask you to keep an open mind and take everything with a grain of salt. Do you own research and conduct your own experiments and observations. 

&nbsp;

Note: All listed books can be purchased on the Amazon Kindle App. Save trees, save space, and read anytime, anywhere. Use Audio Narrations upgrades for times like traveling, cleaning, or working out.

For curious newbies:

* *Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance. And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn't fit in with the core belief. -Frantz Fanon*

**The First Rule of TRP is: You Do Not Talk About TRP. The Second Rule of TRP is: You Do Not Talk About TRP.**

&nbsp;

WARNING: TRP is not a safe subject. *Cue eye-rolls.* The truth is hard to hear and much harder to accept. It is never popular but always a necessity. There are those who would use TRP philosophy incorrectly just like those who use religions or politics to suppress or terrorized others. Keep your mouth shut and your thoughts to yourself whenever these type of topics come up in public. Self-preservation keeps you safe and others safe. Let people think how they want to think.

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Do not talk how 'alpha' you are or how 'beta' someone is in public. It's sad and pathetic. You wouldn't be here if you were a natural alpha. We all were betas. Be humble.*
 * *Do not put down or insult women for not sleeping with you. They are not evil, prudes, bitches, cunts, sluts, whores, or etc because they won't help you get your dick wet. They are human too. They have the freedom of choice and numerous of men to choose from. It is just a different world for women.*
 * *TRP is a brotherhood. For those of you who want to help our brothers who are plugged in, please keep in mind of how much you resisted swallowing the pill. Just keep an ear out when they start dropping hints. They will be ready when they will be ready. Do not force it. You can only lead a horse to water, you can't make it drink it.*

&nbsp;

**A Different Perspective than the Standard Disney Dream:**

&nbsp;

Welcome to TRP. Somehow you arrived here because your method of attracting women isn’t working and you are looking for different answers. It is consider madness if you repeat the same action over and over and expect a different result. It is NOT wrong of you wanting to get better at attracting women just as it is NOT wrong of women wanting to be more attractive to men. 

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Use the Five Stages of Grief to identify your emotions and state of mind. It WILL be hard and does take a lot time to come to an acceptance of TRP perspective. It is completely normal to feel negative feelings such as anger, hate, depression, feeling lied to, exploited, ignorant, etc. What you are feeling is the change. You will breakdown. You must breakdown. Then you will rebuild yourself. We men are taught to not express our troubles or negative emotions in public view due to all sorts of backlash if we do. TRP is a safe and anonymous place where you rant your hatred, your negativity, your mistakes, and your grief in the privacy of your own home and your own mind. This is where we can get honest answers, feedback, and guidance from those who were in the similar situations. Be patience, be kind, and be grateful once you are unplugged.*

**Traditional Male Roles in Modern Times?**

&nbsp;

Be on guard with your traditional male role. There are plenty of people willing to take advantage of it. Men roles and women roles are being questioned and everybody is confused. Mother nature will always be the invisible government of the land. However, mankind's 'laws' are always changing, for better or worse. Men, please do some research for your legal rights (or lack of in some areas). Remember, women have the potential to use men as successful objects just as men have the potential to exploit women as sex objects.

**Are You a “Nice Guy”?**

&nbsp;

Cross-examine your behaviors by heading over to the ‘niceguys’ subreddit to see examples. Learn the difference between infatuation and love. There is also a 'nicegirls' subreddit too.

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Don't ever give favors or gifts for women and expect sex in return. You WILL become passive aggressive when you are disappointed. Women are not stupid. They can smell a guy's agenda or ulterior motives a mile away. Always be upfront with what you want and always be willing to leave or show anyone the door when it doesn't work out.*

**Relationships & the Human's Need to Love**

&nbsp;

Educate yourself about relationships. A lot of relationships fail because one or both parties are not educated about the other sex and/or their own needs and boundaries. Ask yourself honestly and deeply why you want to be in a relationship. You should NEVER depend on one person to fulfill your EVERY single need. Don't put all your eggs in one basket for love, emotional support, loyalty, and etc. Diversify your love between all of your family, friends, coworkers, mentors, etc. Learning to not 'own' another person and be whole and happy on your own is having an abundance mentality. She is NOT yours, it is just your turn.

**Frame Control & Personal Boundaries**

&nbsp;

This is a way to control your reptilian brain or 'reactive' side. Reacting is instinctual.  Responding is a conscious choice.  When something happens, our body is going to react automatically regardless.  The trick is to become aware of this initial reaction, resist doing anything, involve your higher intelligence by considering options, possible ramifications, who you want to be, and what is going to be in your best interest, and, then, choose how to respond. 

* *Man is affected, not by events, but by his view he takes of them. -Epictetus*

* *Recommend Method:*
 * *Stoicism is a great philosophy to adapt.*
 * *You are the CEO of YOUR life. Learn to make decisions for yourself and lead. You are the captain. Let the other person(s) decide if they want to follow. You choose who stays and who goes. Anyone toxic, can include family and friends, need to be let go. All relationships are give and take. Keeping scores in your head is fine but don't get obsess with it. You are the average of the five people you spent your most time with. Crabs in a barrel mentality is an easy red flag.*
 * *Practice saying 'no' out loud with confident and conviction. Learn to say 'sorry' less and only when it is absolutely necessary. Take your time talking. Don't rush things and don't let anyone rush you. Be content during those silent pauses. Gather your thoughts Pick your battles wisely. You can never change a person's world view overnight. Walk away if needed.*
 * *Stay amused. Have a play and/or flirty tone when teasing. It's banter and it's supposed to be fun. Test yourself 'being mean' cautiously. Don't backpetal whenever possible. Never get into a fight with or over a women. You automatically lost frame.*
  * *Imagery training. I have a rather good imagination and tend to play devil advocate with myself. I ""test"" myself against scenarios with my ideal oneities, bitches, AMOG, betas, white knights, femnazi, and etc. You can do it anytime but you must envision REALISTIC solutions. It teaches you where your state of mind is and how much control you have over your emotions and reactions.*

**Sexy Times in Bed**

&nbsp;

Wanting sex is NORMAL for humans. Repeat: Wanting sex is NORMAL for humans. It is a built-in nature for all lifeforms to have sex and reproduce. Just learn to control your biological sexual urges so it doesn't control you. STOP being so thirsty. Sex is great and all but it's not the one thing in this world you should strive for. Your value as a man is not defined by the quantity or quality of women you can bring to bed. Ask yourself honestly and deeply why you want sex. 

* *Destroy the sex glands, whether in man or beast, and you have removed the major source of action. For proof of this, observe what happens to any animal after it has been castrated. A bull becomes as docile as a cow after it has been altered sexually. Sex alteration takes out of the male, whether man or beast, all the FIGHT that was in him -Napoleon Hill*

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Quit using porn and fapping. Practice semen retention. The urge of sex is one of and the MOST POWERFUL driving force of man. You are wasting your drive for fake pixels. (by far one of the hardest thing for me to achieve.)*
 * *Use a condom and wash it out after. Sperm-jackers are real.*
 * *Don't EVER have sex with a drunk girl. You are just asking for a rape accusation.*
 * *For proof of consent: Take selfies throughout the night and save a screenshot of a ""Awesome night"" text and her reply after a night of sex and upload it to the cloud like Google Drive. Invest in a dash cam or home security cameras.*
 * *Don't EVER 'date' coworkers/clients. You are risking your income/job. Don't shit where you eat.*
 * *I used to suffer from premature ejaculation. To last longer, I started doing Kegal exercises and invest in a Fleshlight. Tips I have learned is to use a stopwatch to keep track of time (try to go for 30 mins) and a playlist of sexy songs (YouTube: THE BEDROOM PLAYLIST PT. II R&B/SOUL) to get a sense of a slow thrust rhythm, breathing pace down, mix up body positions, and fingering and licking simultaneously.*

**A Man's Mission In Life & Being Selfish** 

&nbsp;

The most important of concept of TRP is converting your belief from making 'women' being the center of your universe to make 'yourself' the center of your universe. A man's mission should be his MAIN source of happiness. To self-improve is to self-invest which requires you to have self-discipline, learn to love yourself, and put your needs first. An easy concept for self-love is to love and treat yourself like you would love the women of your dreams. Being selfish and putting yourself first is hard for most men to grasp. It is because we have been taught all of our life to self-sacrifice for the greater good of others. Follow your efforts, not your passion. You learn the skills you need in life by searching for it.

**Give Me Masculinity or Give Me Death.**

&nbsp;

Every man should be proud to be a MAN. Society today has drastically demonized the word masculinity. Take pride in yourself and in your manhood. Say to yourself ""I am proud to be a man"". 

&nbsp;

* *Recommend Methods:*
  * *Find some men space. Look, every man need some guy time, away from the women. You need some good brothers to be by your side and can relate to. Take up martial arts, join local sport team, bowling league, golf, pool billard, poker night, sports bar, shooting range, hold a guys night, etc.*
 * *The Art of Manliness. This website gives you a wide variety of little hobbies, manners, and skills that are consider manly. A lot of us didn't have a male role model to teach us these things like how to tie a tie, change a tire, smoke a cigar, etc. This gives you more things to develop your own definition of being a man and personality.*

&nbsp;

**Men's Fashion & Style**

&nbsp;

Learn the basics of men's fashion & style and apply it to your wardrobe. It's like a video game, increase attractiveness +5. Once you have the basic down, get rid of all unnecessary clothes so you can look stylish all the time. Understand that generally ""men"" don't care what men wear but ""women"" do because a woman's SMV is mostly based on her looks. Women invested and max out their looks to gain the attention of high-value men. They compare themselves to other women and thus how their man look too. Remember, your clothes convey non-verbally who you are. If you want to be the guy that girls want to fuck, you got to at least look like the part.

**Talking And Body Language**

&nbsp;

Improve your speech/voice and recognize facial/body language. The percentage of types of human communication are consist of: 55% are body movements and facial expression, 38% are voice tone, volume, and pauses, and 7% are words. This is to help you see the subtle signals of attraction or the need to back off.  

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Watch your favorite shows/movies on silent. Look at the actor's facial expression and body movements.*
 * *Stand tall by using the pencil posture test and fix your forward neck or round shoulders by using the 'hang by your teeth' technique.*
 * *Use a computer stand to level your screen higher for a better sitting posture.*
 * *Place a pen in your mouth and start reading out loud. You should be able to pronounce every syllables, talk slower, take breaths and pauses, and get rid of 'umms' and 'uhh'.*
 * *Record yourself reading out loud. To focus on your tone and volume, place your recording device at different distances away from you. This should give you the idea of how loud and clearly you must be speak in order for the person to hear you. You should also listen to pitch of your voice and make sure it stay low.*

**The Art of Seduction**

&nbsp;

Learning seduction or just basic female interaction. THIS is only when you are at a healthy mindset, have good habits formed, and basically got your shit together. PUA without TRP is basically bluepill mindset but redpill acting.

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Make sure your logistics are in order before going anywhere, anytime. You will never know when the next opportunity will arise. Transportation? Check. Bedroom clean? Check. Condoms? Check.*
 * *You must LEAD at all times. IT IS YOUR responsibility to make the FIRST move and every move after that.*

Don't take life too seriously. We live in a very fucked up world. Somewhere, someone else has it worse than you. You were at the bottom but now know the way up. Work hard but do enjoy the little moments and achievements. Laugh at your mistakes and look at how far you had come. Don't compare your life to others or how perfect it 'should' to be. Success in life is when you can smile and say 'yeah, that was fun'.

7,The most important part of game is not being emotionally invested,2306,0,2306,64mvgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/64mvgf/the_most_important_part_of_game_is_not_being/,149,1491892212.0,"I hate it when people try to oversimplify pick-up, but if I had to boil down pick up into one principle every man should understand, it is this: The woman must be more emotionally invested in you than you are in her at every stage of the relationship. I call this the IRON LAW OF SEDUCTION. 

Understanding and correctly applying this law will solve 99% of the problems men have with women. She’s not responsive to your advances? Not emotionally invested enough. Not returning your calls? Not emotionally invested enough. Flaking? Not emotionally invested enough. On the flipside, as a man, if you emotionally divest yourself from girls, you solve most your own problems. Outcome dependent? You are too emotionally invested in getting laid. Approach anxiety? You are too emotionally invested in the success of the interaction. Neediness and desperation? You are emotionally invested in getting girls. Suck at conversations? You are too emotionally invested in getting laid and can’t just have a regular conversation. 

Emotional investment is subconsciously communicated and women evolved to sense it. One guy can talk to a girl all night without her feeling like he is emotionally invested, but another can talk to her for 2 seconds and get auto-rejected for being too invested. Of course, a woman may talk to you, hang out with you, fuck you, or even date you for a long time if she’s not emotionally invested because she’s horny, crazy, lonely, desperate, drunk, bored, want something from you, etc.... But if she’s not emotionally invested, you are on thin ice and vulnerable at any time to flaking or going cold.  

**What is emotional investment?**

Emotional investment is occupying one’s thoughts and emotions. It is not the same as being interested or “liking” somebody. I “like” a lot of people but I don’t “feel” anything for them and it wouldn’t hurt my feelings if they rejected me or even died.  This distinction is why women flake. Women “like,” get “interested,” and give their numbers to lots of guys, but if she is not at least a little emotionally invested she will not be motivated to get out of bed, put on her make-up, and come somewhere to meet you. Unlike men, women get invited to shit all the time by guys they “like” so they are not going to care about meeting you unless there is some emotional investment.  

Think about emotional investment like this: like most men, you probably like Lamborghinis. But like most men, you probably don’t have one, and you probably don’t spend all day thinking about Lamborghinis and being sad because you don’t have one. But if I lent you a Lamborghini for two months and you drove it around, took care of it, showed it off to your friends, and got laid because of it, you would be sad when I take it back. It’s irrational, but you would get emotionally invested in the Lambo even if you weren’t sad when you never had one. Because you became attached to it and it gave you a sense of identity and power, the Lambo took up space in your thoughts and emotions, making you emotionally invested. 

Emotional investment in people is similar. Being around somebody awesome and feeling like they “belong” to you  becomes addictive like crack. An awesome man makes a woman feel special, loved, important, powerful, and cool. An awesome man is also fun, positive, confident, carefree, and dominant, easing the woman’s anxieties and insecurities. Being around an awesome guy is literally like a drug to women, and if they are around you long enough, they become hooked. 

**The Ben Franklin Theory**
 
Ben Franklin, one of America’s founding fathers and greatest poonhounds, famously and counterintuitively discovered that if person A does something for person B, person A will like person B more. Most people would assume the opposite – if you want people to like you, you should do things for them, so person B should like person B more! Right? Wrong!

Person A “likes” person B more because person A has become emotionally invested. Maybe person A subconsciously expects person B to do something nice back. Maybe person A subconsciously see themselves as “beneath” person B in the ape hierarchy. Maybe person A is protecting their own ego – person B must be somebody special if even I did something for them! Or maybe the simple act of doing something for person B caused person B to enter person A’s thoughts and emotions.
 
Whatever the psychological mechanism, when a woman really likes you, she will WANT to do stuff for you, sometimes even aggressively, and she will WANT to emotionally invest while you fantasize about other things. When a woman really likes you is when you realize that needy, supplicating, validating behavior is not necessary. I have friends that are strippers, and their job is basically to hustle men out of money and to trick guys into buying shit for them. I don’t buy girls things, ever, (and I never, ever visit my friends at work) and I notice that when these strippers start to like me they buy me shit, clean my house, do me favors, etc... One night I even got into an argument with a stripper because she bought me 5 drinks in a row and she wouldn’t let me buy her a drink in return. That’s emotional investment.    
 
**The Woujo Theory**
 
According to my corollary of the Franklin theory, supplicating to a woman, validating yourself to a woman, buying a woman things, following a woman around, allowing a woman to treat you like shit, and spending too much time trying to “help” a woman who doesn’t deserve it subconsciously will cause you to become emotionally invested in her and feel “beneath” her.
 
Sometimes guys will do loserish things, like let a girl treat them badly or repeatedly pursue a girl who doesn’t care about them, and justify it by saying “I don’t really care about her, I just want to fuck.” This is a bad idea, because even though you consciously think you “don’t give a fuck,” by pursuing her, you become emotionally invested, and by allowing her treat you like shit, you subconsciously re-wire your brain to feel like a beta male. Even if you didn't give a fuck before, now you do. 

You can’t control how you feel, but you can control what you do. Where your actions go, your feelings will follow, and where feelings go, your thoughts will follow. If you do loser things, you will eventually feel like a loser, even if you consciously tell yourself you “don’t give a fuck.” If a hot girl tries to strike a Faustian bargain with you and let you fuck her in return for treating you like shit, you must reject that deal out of respect for your own mental health. 

Your brain works by making connections, and when you focus your thoughts and emotions on something, your brain starts connecting that thing to other things in your brain, and that thing becomes “enmeshed” in your wiring, creating a deeper web that is hard to untangle. For example, if you date a really hot girl, your brain will start to associate her with sexual pleasure, or ego, or fun times, and other things you like, so when she dumps you, you will think of her constantly. 

The definition of “not giving a fuck” is only keeping positive thoughts and emotions in your head, and cutting out people, places, activities, thoughts, media, etc... that are negative. “Not giving a fuck” is not about being cold, aloof, an asshole, or stupid, but by filing your thoughts and emotions only with positive things that deserve to be there. 

**Why is emotional investment unattractive?**

Emotional investment is an immediate turn-off. It doesn’t matter why, but I can guess some reasons. 

First, emotional investment is unattractive because people are attracted to lives that are more interesting, exciting, higher, and better than our own. We just assume that somebody living a better life than us is going to be thinking and feeling about their awesome life, not us. If a woman knows she occupies your thoughts and emotions, she will assume your life sucks. She wants to fixate her thoughts and emotions on something higher, but if your thoughts and emotions are fixated on her, she’s back where she started. 

For example, a girl that plays soccer will be attracted to guys that are better at soccer than her because they will appeal to the part of her thoughts and emotions that are invested in soccer. I'm not saying she will never become emotionally invested in a guy who is worse at soccer than she is - she may invest in a guy for other reasons - but the guy is playing with a disadvantage. 

Second, emotional investment is unattractive because, simply put, emotions are bad and scary. Our society acts like “love” is an emotion and “our true selves” are our emotions, but that’s bullshit. Our value lies in what we can do when we are rational, what we’ve learned in our life, what we know how to do, and what we strive to achieve and be when we are clear-headed. Emotions are temporary and fleeting; but true love is a rational, credible commitment to your beloved’s well-being. In his dialogue the Phaedrus, the Greek philosopher Plato said that emotional love is a kind of madness – when things are going well, you are irrationally nice to the person out of proportion to what they deserve. When things are going badly, you are irrationally nasty to the person out of proportion to what they deserve. Women know that when you are irrationally nice to them you will eventually be irrationally shitty. 

Most of our emotions are selfish, irrational, unrealistic, uncontrollable, and oftentimes downright evil. Emotions are fundamentally needy: they always want something, even if the “want” is to help somebody. If you see a beautiful woman and think “I like her, and I want to make her happy and do nice things for her,” you’re lying to yourself. You want things FROM her. You want to fuck her, use her for an ego boost, have your friends see you with her, and make yourself feel better for being a “good person.” You don’t want to see her run off and be happy with another guy, you want her to be unhappy with you. When you show emotion women subconsciously know you want something and that puts pressure on them, and they run away. Women sometimes will hang out with guys they don’t like or aren’t attracted to in any way, just because those guys are not emotionally invested and are not putting any pressure on them.  

When you become extremely emotional, you fantasize about getting your beloved back or hurting them for the wrongs they did to you, you stalk them, you act weird, you feel depressed, you can’t function, etc… Love songs glorify these feelings, but these are not healthy feelings. They are signs of weakness. Women have these feelings things too (oftentimes much more deeply than men), and they know it’s a scary pit to be in, so if they sense for even a second that a man is feeling these things (or is even just slightly beginning to feel these things), they run away immediately. Women want an emotional rock. They want the lifeguard on the edge of the pool pulling them out, not somebody drowning with them. 

Women also take longer to get emotionally invested in men than men take to get emotionally invested in women. Men evolved to seek “fertile” women (big ass, big tits, healthy face) to impregnate as soon as possible. Women, on the other hand, evolved to find the strongest man in the tribe that could protect her and her baby, so they seek a larger group of traits, many of which are long-term traits (confidence, dominance, emotional stability, intelligence, etc…). It takes a woman time to figure out if a guy has these traits but a man can immediately be attracted to a hot girl. In every man-woman relationship there is a period of time where the man is emotionally invested, but the woman is still “rational” and feeling the guy out. Many men fuck it up here – they start acting creepy, or weird, overly nice, overly fixated, and the woman, who feels nothing, thinks the guy isweird or worse. 

Of course, emotions are a part of life and can be beautiful if channeled correctly. But you shouldn’t show your emotions to a woman until she has also developed those emotions. 

Third, emotional investment makes you stupid and saps you of your vitality and awesomeness. Tons interesting, smart, funny, cool, successful guys become vacant shells of their normal selves around women, partly because their thoughts and emotions are empty of everything that makes them awesome. If you are deep in a game of chess and I try to have a conversation with you about quantum physics you will sound stupid because your thoughts and emotions are full of chess. Seduction requires intelligence and creativity, but if your thoughts and emotions are just “durr, she’s a pretty woman” you’re going to fail. Because women are “rational” longer than men, they want to have rational, intelligent conversations about interesting shit. 

Another reason is power. It’s a sad fact of life, but humans are wired to look at relationships in power terms. We subconsciously rank everybody in a particular social situation from least to most powerful. Women are much more aware of the power dynamic because they are generally less powerful than men. And unfortunately, we subconsciously see emotional people as lower in the power hierarchy. The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche said, correctly in my opinion, that individuals higher in the social hierarchy do not feel emotions for people lower than them. The lower ranked apes evolved to obey and be obsessed with the alpha male because they need his protection and resources, but the alpha male feels nothing for the lower ranked apes because he does not need them for anything. 

Most importantly, women are not attracted to emotionally invested men because women are attracted to RESILIENCE. Resilience here means “the ability to confidently pursue your goals and not let anything or anybody perturb you.” 

Women are attracted to resilience because they naturally want a protector, and a protector’s commitment is only credible if he cannot be thrown off of his mission, whatever that mission is. If a protector becomes emotional, dishonest, distracted, or submissive, he can no longer be trusted to protect. We subconsciously see emotional people as weak because they can be easily controlled. If a guy is emotional about a girl, he is likely to agree with whatever she says, let her get away with bad behavior, etc… 

If a protector wavers for even a second, the woman becomes anxious and fearful, but a confident man with boundaries is not scared and cannot be thrown off of his mission. You must be a brick wall that cannot be moved or affected: if you approach her or escalate with her, it is purely based on your own desire, not her cajoling. At every moment you should think to yourself “am I doing this because I want to or because I am trying to impress her”? Sometimes you need to monitor her emotional investment on a moment-by-moment basis. 

**Subconscious communication** 

Women can quickly sense by your body language, words, demeanor, tone of voice and actions whether you are emotionally invested. Neither you nor her may consciously know you’re invested, but you will just “feel” unattractive to her. Sometimes very subtle changes in behavior (staring too long, asking a question that is too intrusive too early) can tip off that you are too invested. 

I use the “gravity theory” to gauge emotional investment. In social settings, high-value people are “bigger” and therefore “draw” lower-value people to them. If you look at any party, you will see hot girls usually in the center, relaxing and having fun, and guys literally surrounding them like planets around the sun. There is a reason these guys are called “orbiters.” If the girl gets up to leave, the guys may play it cool for a while, but they then get up to follow her. Your ultimate goal is to become the center of gravity so women are drawn to you, not vice versa, which is hard, because as a man you must approach. But even if you approach your demeanor and body language can exude the message of “I am the center of gravity, and I create a rip in space-time that compels you to come to me.” 

The subconscious subtext of an interaction is 99%. For example, the sentence “can I buy you a drink” can have a wide range of subconscious meanings depending on the tone, body language, context and emotion I deliver them in. “Can I buy you a drink” can mean “I want to fuck you,” “I feel like I owe you something and I want to pay you back,” “I’m a generous guy and I like to just people free things,” “you’re a good friend, and I want to show my appreciation,” “I’m a loser and I want to make you like me by buying you things,” etc… What matters is not your superficial words, but your subconscious context. 

Because seduction is mostly subconscious, I can’t teach you every detail of the walk, speaking style, body language, demeanor, etc… of a guy who is not emotionally invested. Even if I did, it’s too much for you to remember and process. I even doubted the efficacy of writing this article because it’s incredibly hard to “fake” an emotional state for a long period of time and most people will go back to behaving like what they feel they are.  

**The paradox of escalation**

So far it sounds like the right solution to get girls would be to just ignore them completely. You won’t look emotionally invested, right? Unfortunately, that doesn’t work. It is the man’s responsibility to approach and escalate because women do not get emotionally invested quickly and are afraid of rejection. 

To get a girl attracted to you, you must show at least some initial interest and escalate, luring her into becoming emotionally invested in you. Magicians use a technique called “forcing,” where they trick the person into thinking they are picking a random card out of the deck when the person is really picking the card the magician wanted them to pick. Seduction is similar: she should feel like she is picking you, not vice-versa. You are just opening the door to her. 

**The challenge of seduction**

Seducing a woman while you appear not emotionally invested is incredibly challenging. First, women’s aversion to emotional investment is mostly subconscious – consciously, women want the guy to show at least some interest. And it’s naturally hard to hang around a woman you like for a long period of time and not become invested to at least some degree. Beautiful women create a reality distortion field where men lose all concept of rationality, truth, normal standards of right and wrong, etc… You can say “you’re overthinking this, just be yourself,”, but women touch men’s strongest emotion, so many men literally forget how be themselves. When a beautiful woman walks into a nightclub a swarm of otherwise successful, rational, manly men immediately lose their fucking minds. They start begging for her approval, trying to buy her things, acting stupid, etc… 

And like I said earlier, men emotionally invest quicker than women, so we must be patient because our emotions push us to jump the gun and get right into lovey-dovey mode. And in non-romantic contexts, people become emotionally invested at the same rate, so you are used to the other person feeling the same as you if the interaction is going well. And when we feel emotionally invested in somebody, we naturally are going to want to elicit a positive emotional response. But trying to make a woman happy that is not emotionally invested comes off as validation-seeking, supplicating, bitch behavior. You must instead do what is RIGHT. A woman may seem cold, and we may think we can “warm her up” by being “nice” to her, but we should really just pursue our mission and have faith that she will emotionally invest even though she appears on the surface to not be attracted or care about you. Remember: women are constantly sizing you up, so even if they don’t look like they are attracted or paying attention, they are. 

Seduction is a gamble because you must have faith that eventually the woman will start to emotionally invest, knowing she might not. Sometimes she just won’t like you. Sometimes she just wants attention. Sometimes she is in love with you but won’t let it on. Some women are damaged and never emotionally invest in anybody – they see all men as objects to be used. This is why you must assume attraction – because you DON’T KNOW. 

**How to not be emotionally invested**

If you take away one thing from this article, it is this: a woman who is not yet invested in you must not occupy a big part of your thoughts and emotions. You must have your mind and heart on other things when interacting with women. Period. If she hasn’t made room for you in her head and heart yet, you shouldn’t make space for her in your head and heart. If you make this change right now, I promise your results will instantly improve. Women are the dessert to a good life, not the main course, and that’s how women should feel when you are talking to them. WOMEN WANT TO BE DESSERT.

Here are my main steps to not becoming emotionally invested:

1)      Realize you don’t need to emotionally invest

2)      Have an interesting and awesome life that occupies your thoughts and emotions.

3)      Have “abundance mentality” with respect to women.

4)      Have boundaries and be unperturbable.

5)      Focus on your own fun first.

**Realize you don’t need to emotionally invest**
 
This may be the most important step. I think a lot of guys emotionally invest in girls because society and pop culture subconsciously make us think that for a man to get a girl, he must supplicate to her and emotionally invest in her. In the movies, the confident, successful guy living his own life never gets the girl; instead the winner is the beta loser who falls in love with her from afar, and then spends the rest of the movie trying to “get” her, enduring multiple rejections and humiliations. These movies also teach that women are delicate flowers that need constant coddling and lovey dovey bullshit. That’s not how it works in the real world. 
 
Men also misunderstand women’s aversion to rejection. Women have a strong need to be “accepted” (as all betas do) and therefore are much more sensitive to rejection than men. The phrase “hell hath no fury like a woman scorned” is true. Dread game and “ignoring” women only works if she is ignoring you first. But if you outright reject her, or if she makes a move on you, or asks for acceptance, and you say “no” or she feels like you are ignoring her there is a strong chance she will emotionally “un-invest.” Because women have this strong need for constant acceptance and validation, men mistakenly think they must emotionally invest. But all you really need to do is not reject her or make her feel excluded. It’s a thin line between keeping a woman “accepted” and emotionally investing in her. 

To win this game, you should only do something for a woman if the woman would do it for you. If you want to buy her a drink, think about whether she would buy you a drink. If she wouldn’t, don’t. If she wants you to wait for her, think about whether she would wait for you. If she wouldn’t, don’t. If there is a girl you always say hi to, but she never says hi to you, stop saying hi to her. She knows who you are, she can say hi to you. It’s ok to “win” in relationships. 
 
Again, this is easier said than done. Society and your emotions team up to make you feel like you need to follow girls around, wait for them, put up with their bullshit, buy them drinks, etc… You must fight your feelingss and social training and have faith that if you stay the course women will become attracted. This requires the ability to say “no” to a woman (saying “no” is different than rejecting her) and the ability to walk away from her, even permanently. 
  
**Have an interesting and awesome life that occupies your thoughts and emotions**
 
Humans are wired to seek good feelings. If the main part of our life is not making us happy (job, school, our hobbies), we get those good feelings from other sources: drugs, trashy TV, women, food, etc… All those things are not bad by themselves, but if your regular life doesn’t make you happy, you will overly emotionally invest in bad things and become addicted and depressed. If your life is miserable, you will subconsciously and unknowingly immediately start overly investing in women.

I use the “cheese pizza method.” Whenever I feel like I’m getting too emotional, I fill my thoughts and emotions with something I love – cheese pizza, Oreo cheesecake, the day I did mushrooms at the beach, reading about dinosaurs stoned, etc... This clears my head and allows me to act “normal” around women. When I am thinking about doing something for a girl I ask myself “what has she done to dislodge cheese pizza out of my heart and mind?” You can replace cheese pizza with anything, ideally an incredible, thrilling life that she would want to join. 
 
**Have abundance mentality with respect to girls**
 
No matter how awesome your life is, it is hard to not emotionally invest in girls. Abundance mentality is when your thoughts and emotions are full of other women, so you don’t need this one girl. If you don’t have other girls, you need to delude yourself. I recall times when I did have abundance and put myself back in that mental space. If you’ve never had abundance, imagine you are Brad Pitt or some other celebrity and think about how he would feel and act.

**Have boundaries and be unperturbable**

Women want you to be an immovable wall that confidently and joyfully pursues his mission. She will try to perturb you from that mission, not because she wants to see you fail, but because she wants to test whether you are actually a brick wall or a façade for something softer. The same way you knock on a desk at the furniture store to see if it is real wood, a woman shit tests you to see if you are actually confident enough to pursue your mission or if you will be perturbed. And the more confident and immovable you are, the stronger the shit tests become. This is true even if the mission is getting her! As long as she is into it, you need to escalate as if you already know she will say yes.

Your mission, when out, should be maximum fun. She should sense that your emotional investment is “where’s the party? Where’s the next fun thing?” You should have a plan for the entire night: I’m going to X, then I’m going to Y , etc… You should not let the woman hijack your plans and take the lead. Your primary mission (career, hobbies, etc…) should also be in your head. Remember the song “girls just wanna have fun?” In truth, everybody just wants to have fun but boys are wracked with anxiety because they are trying to impress girls. Whenever you are feeling nervous, scared, anxious or like you are emotionally investing too much in a girl, just say to yourself “I’m here to have fun. If you contribute, great. If not, you are dismissed.” Fun and positivity always win. 

Example: If a beautiful woman is talking about something incredibly boring most men pretend to be interested. Wrong! Women know when they are being boring and it is sometimes a subtle shit test to see if you will let her get away with it. Women are not desperate for sex and they do not need to hang around if a guy is being boring, stupid or mean, and they cannot respect or empathize with a guy who would put up with bullshit from her. Men let women be boring when they lose their vision of the good life. A good life involves beautiful women, but it also involves interesting conversations. If you aren’t getting interesting conversations from her, you would leave because you have options. Whenever a woman is being boring, I change the subject just to let her know I don’t tolerate bullshit.  

By having a vision of the good life, boundaries, and confidence that your life, thoughts and emotions are interesting and valuable, you can challenge and stimulate a woman. Women want a man that will help them grow and introduce them to a better life and more interesting world than the one they currently inhabit. They don’t want some a that agrees with everything they say, a pushover, or a simple-minded conformist.  Women want a guy who is willing to walk away at any time, not because he is some cold-hearted psychopath, but because once a man shows that is he NOT willing to walk away at any time, there is no challenge or growth. 

Of course, for most of you, this is very difficult. Many of you have uninteresting lives so a beautiful woman would instantly become the most interesting and important thing your life or you are so sex starved and desperate that you don’t care if a woman is being boring, or mean, or uninterested, or whatever. 

**Focus on your own fun first**

Imagine you paid $500,000 to spend a week with Leonardo DiCaprio (or whatever celebrity you think lives an awesome life) and when you get there Leonardo says “tell us what we should do?” You would say “I don’t know, what are the options?” and Leo goes “I don’t have anything planned – let’s just do what you were gonna do.” You would be pissed! You want to become part of Leo’s awesome life, not make your own plan. That’s how girls feel when men don’t have a plan. They want to join your life, not lead you around in their life. That’s why you need to focus on your own fun first. You may like you are being rude or selfish, but you’re not, because women are more attracted to the act of leading than the destination necessarily. 

**How to make her emotionally invest in you**

For a woman to emotionally invest in you, certain shit must happen: 

1)	She must “like” you – i.e., she must find you pleasant, friendly, good-looking, compatible with her values and interests. 

2)	She must feel an emotional connection with you.

3)	She must feel accepted by you. If she you are rejecting her, ignoring her, or being hostile, she will not emotionally invest. 

4)	She must watch you be confident and resilient. 

5)	She needs to spend time around you. 

**She must like you**

This one is self-explanatory. Women are usually not going to invest in you if you don’t share their interests, values, goals, etc… Some girls want a rapper covered in tattoos, others want a nerdy guy who watches Star Wars. If you’re a versatile guy with lots of interests, a lot more women will like you, but some people just aren’t compatible. 

**She must feel an emotional connection with you**

The key to developing an emotional connection with a girl is experiencing emotionally exciting things together. The ultimate is of course, passionate sex, but a good concert, a deep conversation, even a beer pong game you guys play together can help build an emotional connection. 

Another way to build an emotional connection is for her to vicariously experience your confidence. She wants you to be her emotional rock, so she would like to project her insecurities and fears onto you, and watch you brush them off as if they were nothing. She also wants to watch you take the lead and make the night fun. 

A woman has emotional energy, and that energy must be directed towards something or somebody. You want that energy to be directed to you. The easiest way to do this is just by spending time around her. Just “being around” will help build attraction as long as you are not fucking it up by being needy or making her feel bad. The best way to get women to like you is to be “forced” to be around them, such as work or a group hangout, where you do not supplicate to them or validate yourself to them. My friend used to take girls out on his boat, and these girls would usually end up liking me by the end of the day because we would have spent all day together. Celebrities get so much tang because women watch them in movies or listen to their music and become emotionally invested, whereas the celebrity shows the women no emotional investment in all. 

**She must feel accepted by you.**

Again, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, so it must feel like the door to you is open. As she invests in you more, you must escalate more. You can fuck this up by being an asshole, not being sensitive to her emotions, and not reading her advances correctly. 

**She must watch you confidently pursue your goals**

The word confidence comes from the Latin con (with) + fidens (faith). A man with confidence has faith that he will succeed in whatever he does and cannot be stopped by anybody. Women get turned by watching a man confidently pursue his mission. Why are women w so attracted to DJs, promoters, and drug dealers in the club? Those guys aren’t exactly the “cream” of society. It’s because those guys are the only people at the club actually doing something. All the other guys are just sitting there drooling over the girls, instantly reducing their attractiveness. 

**Putting it all together**

To apply all this knowledge, my strategy is to adopt a rational, almost businesslike demeanor, at least in the early stages of the interaction. As I said earlier, women are “rational” at the beginning before they are emotionally invested, so you should also be rational. A man must act almost like he is a woman: he is interested in a relationship (or maybe even just sex) but he has high standards and must evaluate the woman thoroughly first and make sure she is suitable before he gets emotionally invested. You should act like your actions are guided by a seduction computer that makes all the decisions based on the available information, not your emotions. 

One technique is called “disinterested interest.” Your rational words should show interest and enthusiasm but you must communicate the “emotion” of “I’m just talking to you to be nice, I am not totally emotionally invested in you yet and I could walk away at any moment.” The best way to do this is by keeping your thoughts and emotions focused on something else, other than her. 

You should not, however, stay completely rational. You must allow yourself to show your emotions about things that are not her: your passions, your interests, your friends, etc… And you can show emotion towards her if she deserves it: laugh if she says something funny, thank her if she does something nice, sympathize with her if she says something sad: just don’t let on that you feel emotional about “her” unconnected to anything she is or has done. 

And of course, escalate sexually. Paradoxically, it is possible to escalate sexually and not appear emotionally invested. In fact, a lot of women (especially damaged ones) are looking for emotionless sex. You must touch her, you must turn the conversation sexual, you must do “seductive” things like look into her eyes and whisper in her ear, etc… And you must confidently take the lead in the conversation and the situation in general, leading her from place to place, getting intimate with her, etc… And when she starts to emotionally invest, make her feel like you MIGHT emotionally invest too (but not as much as her). Sometimes if you play it “too” cool she will think you just like her platonically or that you lost interest. 

**A broader view**

This article is obviously about getting girls, but the principles are applicable in all areas of your life. Simply put, you should not invest your thoughts and emotions into people, places, institutions, and activities that do not give a fuck about you and/or do not produce a return that equals the investment you put into them. One of the biggest mistakes people make is investing too much in their job, friendship, hobbies, etc..., and getting 0 out of it. 

Additionally, whatever you do becomes your emotional investment. If you spend every weekend hanging out with piece of shit people that just do drugs, complain and make bad decisions, guess what, you are now becoming a piece of shit person. You are what you do.

8,Three ways to consciously manipulate women before they subconsciously manipulate you.,2294,0,2294,6woyzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6woyzi/three_ways_to_consciously_manipulate_women_before/,368,1504010140.0,"The universe created two types of men--alphas and betas--to serve the purposes of the species: Alphas to lead and impregnate and betas to follow and serve. Some science suggests that in ancient times only 1 out of every 16 men successfully reproduced. Although more betas than this reproduce in modern times due to social order and the institution of marriage, I nevertheless suspect that the 1-in-16 ratio is useful in illustrating a plausible proportion between the two male types today.

Assuming some degree of historical constancy with respect to the above dynamic I see two lessons to take from it: 1. If you're an alpha--sex with dozens of women is a likely predictor of this, if not a definition--you're probably in the slim minority (good job). And 2. If you're a beta, you may have your work cut out for you seeing as alphas are only the top 6 percent of men.

TRP can serve both groups by providing the information necessary for betas to mimic and perhaps eventually become alphas and for alphas to maximize and streamline their strengths to squeeze the most value out of the sexual marketplace.

As a rule it is the nature of women to use men for protection, resources, and, in the case of her interaction with alpha-males, reproduction. This is due in large part to their physical vulnerabilities. Manipulation is an imperfect word to use to describe this mechanism because it presupposes a degree of maliciousness or intentional deception but it's useful in that it reminds us of how tricky women instinctively are with respect to the value they advertise versus what they provide in an interaction pattern not deliberately calibrated by a more-manipulative, intelligent, and self-interested male. Arthur Schopenhauer described the innate modus operandi of women in these words:

> With girls, Nature has had in view what is called in a dramatic sense a “striking effect,” for she endows them for a few years with a richness of beauty and a, fullness of charm at the expense of the rest of their lives; so that they may during these years ensnare the fantasy of a man to such a degree as to make him rush into taking the honorable care of them, in some kind of form, for a lifetime—a step which would not seem sufficiently justified if he only considered the matter.

Because women are more dependent on men for survival than visa versa, they have collectively developed a compensatory characteristic which allows them to extract value from beta males in ways that are not mutually beneficial. This is manifest in an automatic and brilliant instinct for interpersonal negotiation where she will constantly test the nature of the relationship in the hopes of extracting more value from a man while reducing the value she must provide to him. The classic example of this is the cheating housewife that—if we're all honest—don't blame once we see how beta the husband is (and because sexual strategy is amoral anyway). Women in this respect are instinctively significantly better at sexual strategy than men are. Therefore, we need our own compensatory characteristic: this subreddit.

Much chatter in the manosphere regarding the unpleasant nature of women is only accurate when describing the interaction patterns of women with men who haven't learned female nature and how to consciously manipulate it so as to tip the balance of power in his favor. To quote from a second and superior German philosopher:

> The true man wants two things: danger and play. For that reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything.

Dangerous playthings require skills to enjoy without getting cut or burned. Let's discuss a couple of them here.

##1. Develop and/or mimic a sex-satisfied, not a sex-desiring, mental disposition.

Women don't consciously agree with this but their psychological firmware nevertheless insists on being attracted to men who are already getting laid. This is a very primal form of pre-selection as her mind conducts this subconscious logical syllogism: ""I don't know whether this man is fit for reproduction but the fact that there are signs that he may be already getting laid (he's not desperate, he's barely trying, he's already happy and cheerful) would suggest that other women have already made the assessment that he is.""

There are two differing and mutually compatible ways of cultivating this sex-satisfied state (abundance mentality). One is to actually induce it by having sex with women regularly, going as low on the SMV totem pole as is needed to get laid. The other is to mimic it by artificially altering your behavior and demeanor to match the patterns of someone who *is* getting laid. There is no shame in this: Just avoid like the plague any behavior that she could identify as needy, desperate, or sexually frustrated. This requires you to constantly watch yourself, which is exhausting, so I don't recommend adopting this 2nd technique exclusively.

Heartiste illustrated this point well when he said (paraphrased) ""When you don't know what to say to a woman, imagine that you're already lying in bed with two of them.""

There is a lot to be gained by haggling your way down in the sexual marketplace just so you can be getting laid regularly. I am open to the idea that other male personality types might prefer to not have sex at all than to have sex with a low-SMV female but I would argue that that preference is born of low testosterone or an over-reliance on masturbation and pornography. There appear to be two camps in TRP. One says ""fuck women"" and the other says ""fuck women."" I am of the latter.

##2. Treat her as if she was born to serve you.

The most attractive combination of psychological traits in a man are narcissism and happiness. The latter has some overlap with our discussion about sex-satiety but the former is separate.

Narcissism for our purposes here is delusional self-confidence and reckless self-interest. It's the characteristic of a man who has massive double-standards regarding himself versus the women he dates, and he knows it, and he laughs when he's called out on it.

Developing a specific, strategically deployable form of narcissism with respect to the opposite sex is tricky and every man will integrate this property into their existing social personality differently, but one trick I've found useful is to use a sort of affirmation or article of faith to undo and rewire the beta programming that the mind uses when interacting with women. An anonymous comment in the manosphere once described it this way: ""Act like you are the star of the #1 reality show of all time: cameras following you around and millions watching it because you are so damn interesting.""

In short, brainwash yourself into believing that you're a god. Eventually you may learn that this lie is actually true.

Learned-narcissism mirrors pre-selection closely. In pre-selection a woman doesn't have enough information to know whether you are fit for reproduction so she uses the judgments of *other women* to make that evaluation. With narcissism and delusional self-confidence, a woman doesn't have enough information to know whether you are fit for reproduction so she uses the judgment that *you* have made about yourself to make that evaluation. I assume it goes without saying that a woman isn't consciously considering you as a reproductive mate when she's discovering whether she wants to fuck you. This is all subconscious psychological phenomena that she herself has no direct awareness of. All she consciously experiences is a desire to fuck you.

While betas exist to serve women, women exist to serve alphas. Sometimes this dynamic is subtle; othertimes women will explicitly enjoy being or feeling used up by their alpha male partners. Treat her a little bit like she exists to serve you to establish the desired alpha-to-female relationship pattern.

##3. Ignore anything and everything she says that you would have preferred she didn't say.

The most efficient *and benevolent* method of extracting the desired value out of the interactions you have with females is to punish and reward her by giving and withdrawing your attention. Counter-intuitively, ignoring a woman when she acts or speaks in an undesired way is more effective in disincentivizing than is confronting her verbally or even using physical violence. This is because ignoring a woman communicates a greater readiness to withdraw from her permanently. This demonstrates value and instills insecurity in her; whereas verbal confrontation communicates to her that she is his only option and that he's more inclined to try to control her than he is to merely gravitate away from negativity and undesired behavior and in the direction of other females from whom he knows he can procure a preferable relationship.

If a girl you're interacting with asks an unwanted question or makes an unwanted statement, flatly ignore it. I'm not suggesting that you fold your arms like a frustrated kid and give her the silent treatment. I am suggesting that you literally act exactly as if she had not said it at all. This is frame-reaffirmation. It's the most effective and efficient way of dealing with her bullshit and is especially preferable to verbal confrontation if either of you are prone to the slippy slope of escalating negative emotions.

There is a recurring and compelling sentiment here that the sexual marketplace is a zero-sum game. I believe this is only the case when men fail to learn how to calibrate male-female interaction patterns to satisfy the self-interested nature of the male and the alpha-pleasing instincts of the female—instead of the self-interested nature of the female and the female-pleasing instincts of the male.",2017-08-29 12:35:40

It was left up for approximately 14 hours, made the reddit front page then was deleted by TIFU mods. They provided no reason.

Tried to re-post at relationships and they deleted it instantly. No reason provided.

Apparently, the fact that my story resonated with so many people is threatening in some way. Threatening to whom, I'll leave you to decide.

So I'm reposting here. Enjoy.

I was in the US Army. I was stationed in South Korea and I met a girl while I was back home on leave visiting friends. She was really cute and I liked her a lot. We clicked instantly. She opened up to me about how her dad had raped her when she was 9. My heart went out to her and we kept in touch for several months even after I left to go back to Korea. A relationship blossomed and we eventually ended up married. A year later, she was pregnant. I was overjoyed. We both were. 9 months later, my son was born. Within a couple months of his birth, the new-baby joyous haze had faded and postpartum depression set in with my wife. I did what I could to help lift her spirits but I was also working 12-hour days and sometimes weekends because, ya know... it's the Army. When my son was 6 months old, I got the news that my unit was going to deploy to Iraq. We were sent to the Fort Irwin National Training Center in the Mojave desert to train. While I was there, I got a call from a friend back at my unit. He had seen my wife in a Military Police vehicle with my son.

I was shattered. I was thousands of miles away and powerless to do anything and didn't know what was wrong or what might have happened to her and my son. I knew she had been in a fragile state. What could be wrong?!? I was absolutely frantic for days. She wasn't answering her phone. Worse yet, we were doing training exercises and I had lost my phone charger at some point and my phone had died. I called again from a friend's phone and left a voicemail with his phone number in the hopes that she would call back. Finally, on day 3 after hearing this news, she calls his phone. He runs over to me and brings me his cell. The wind is blasting sand into my face and it's 110 degrees outside. I ask her what's wrong and what the hell happened?!?

She tells me she wants a divorce... I'm dumbfounded. This is out of nowhere and I'm in total shock. Turns out she wasn't in a Military Police vehicle because there she was in trouble... She was fucking the MP. Of course, she couldn't very well leave my months-old son by himself so she was carting him along with her while she was doing it. It had been going on for months, even before I left. There's pictures of her and him and baby son with a tent in the background. They'd gone camping. Asked her where my son had slept and she matter-of-factly stated that he'd been in the tent with them. Nevertheless, I try to work things out for the sake of our son, but she's adamant and wants the divorce. Divorces are never quick so some tense months went by... but finally the divorce is granted. The next morning, I wake up and she is gone. She left our son with me, got on a plane, she's gone.

So there I was, a 22-year-old soldier who is suddenly a single dad of a now 10-month-old baby and I'm supposed to get on a plane to Iraq the following week. I didn't know what to do. So I grab my son, put him in his car seat, and drive to my unit's headquarters and sit down with my Commander and explain the situation. My son's mother has left and gone back to her parent's house, my own parents both work full-time along with parenting my mentally handicapped sister and can't possibly take on my son as well. So my CO says he'll have to consult with the Battalion Commander about what to do.

I nervously wait a few days. Then, 6 days before we're supposed to deploy to Iraq, my CO comes back and tells me that they're going to put me out of the Army on an honorable discharge. In a way, I was relieved because my son was my first priority. But I also have never felt that guilty in my entire life. I had trained with these guys in my unit for years preparing to go to war. Now I'm not going at all. I was a sergeant so I had soldiers who were underneath me that got transferred to another squad. I felt like they were being abandoned by me and there was nothing I could do to stop it.

Then, on the day my unit is leaving, my company is getting on the buses to drive to the airport. My CO hands me a clipboard and asks me to check off each soldier as they get on the bus. So I did. Each one shook my hand and wished me luck as he got on the bus. I watched every face go by and shook every hand. My CO was the last on the bus. He took the clipboard from me, I saluted him, and he shook my hand and got on the bus and they drove away. Suddenly, I was standing in front of the headquarters building with my son napping in his carrier on the pavement beside me and I was totally and utterly alone. I sat down on the pavement and (I have to sit my manhood aside here for a moment) cried harder than I have ever cried in my entire life. I had never felt so painfully guilty and so alone.

Three months later, I was honorably discharged from the Army and on my way home. I got myself a place, got set up with a community college and started pursuing a degree while doing the single dad thing. I was recovering and putting my life together because I had to. For him.

Three months into this new life I'd set up for myself, a sheriff's deputy shows up at my front door. He hands me a manila envelope with court papers in it. I'd been served. My ex-wife was suing for custody.

Now, let's pause for a moment. So far, all of this is a rather unfortunate set of circumstances and you're probably wondering ""So where's the FU? This doesn't sound like it's your fault."" Up until now, you'd be right. So here it is. Here's where I fucked up: For the first month, I didn't even get a lawyer. I just called her and asked her what in the world she was doing. Couldn't we work this out? Fuck-up number 1. Always get a lawyer if you get a damn court summons. No exceptions. Your lawyer needs time to prepare your case. The longer you take to get one, the more ill-prepared he/she is. So finally I figure this out because things just aren't getting worked out. So I get a lawyer. The lawyer of course tells me to cease communication with her and that all communication will now go through him to her lawyer. But, in my hubris, I did not listen. I called her due to my emotional state being so out of whack. The conversation was somewhat peaceable at first but turned sour. At some point, she asked me if I had firearms in my house. I responded that of course I did to protect our son she abandoned and blah blah blah... This is fuck-up #2. She recorded it. This recording was the central piece of evidence she used in court against me. Of course the gun was locked up but she claimed he was in danger. Never ever disobey your lawyer and never base legal decisions on emotion.

Another six months passed and then a judge awarded sole physical custody of my son to my ex-wife despite the fact that I had been taking care of him alone this entire time since she left us both. This sounds crazy, I know. However, we're talking about a southern bible belt judge who was golf buddies with my ex-father-in-law. So yeah... that was that. While the system is a bit of joke when it comes to father's rights, I ultimately lost my son because I fucked up.

TL;DR - Guy in army gets cheated on by his wife and loses his wife, then his career, and then, due to his own hubris, his son.

10,Getting ready to black-knight a high school girl,2188,0,2188,20owa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/20owa2/getting_ready_to_blackknight_a_high_school_girl/,432,1395142991.0,"So, I am a high school teacher. One of my female students didn't like a disciplinary action I took today, so she absolutely lost her shit, got up in my face, pushed me (not hard, mind you) and told me, ""I am going to fuck you up!""

Moments later, I had the loudmouth bitch in the principal's office, and returned to my class to discover that, true to form, at least one of the students had managed to get all of this on a camera phone. Meanwhile, the student was in the office, texting other students to delete the video and to lie about the way she was behaving. The students were there giving me the play-by-play of every message.

I stopped by after that class to follow up with the principals, and momma has shown up and wants to throw down as well (no father in the picture -- go figure). Based on her daughter claiming that I had assaulted her in class, she proceeded to call the police to try and have me charged with assault. At that point, she was yelling at the police that everything was on video for them to see.

Well, the principal and the cops got their hands on the video, and saw what really went down. The principal got one of the students to provide the text messages of this stupid girl attempting to do her damage control, and the principal said that she would be suspended for a few days, and told me that I could file charges. If I do that, this girl will end up in alternative school for the foreseeable future.

And, you know what? That is exactly what I am going to do. Teenage girls who cry and make up stories to try and get themselves out of trouble grow up to be the kind of woman who will make false rape and abuse allegations in order to get back at men who make them angry. If there had not been hard physical evidence, witnesses, and documentation of what went on in my classroom today, it would have been an issue of ""he said, she said,"" with not only this position, but my entire career on the line. Nothing like a child abuse charge to have one's teaching credentials revoked.

So, tomorrow I am going to formally file charges against this girl and let the legal system have a crack at her. Maybe she will think twice about recklessly lying to her mother, the principal, and the police with tears in her eyes after conducting herself like a complete cunt. And maybe her mother will think twice before calling the cops to complicate a matter that didn't require their attention. Maybe other students who see what happens to her will get the hint that you don't pull that kind of shit without real-world consequences.

Or maybe not. Regardless, I am going to thoroughly enjoy giving this stupid girl a taste of her own medicine!
 

UPDATE 3/24: Met with principal, the girl, and her mother today. Girl is still maintaining her lies, and mother thinks we should both apologize to each other. Yeah, no. I told the principal to go forward with the charges.  Plus, she has her best friend lying for her, saying that she was the one who sent the messages to cover things up, not her. 

UPDATE 4/17: Sorry for the delay in the update. The police officer on campus was reluctant to file it as an assault (shocking, right?), but she in the interim she actually got herself in more trouble for jumping another girl on campus, so she's off to alternative placement anyway.

There were two positive results from this: by maintaining my frame throughout this whole thing, she was made out to be a fool by the other students on campus, as well as her mother. Momma was actually calling some of the other students in the class to try and get them to change their stories -- so much so, that one of the student reported that she had to block the number from her phone.

The second is that students (in my class, at least) better understand that I am not to be fucked with now.",2014-03-18 11:43:11

#Step 0 - Understand The Ultimate Maxim of Tinder

**IF YOU ARE NOT GETTING MATCHES, ITS BECAUSE YOUR PICTURES SUCK.** 100% of the time this is the case. It's not Tinder screwing you, its not Tinder trying to get you to pay for its Plus/Gold features, its not shallow women, its not women only on there for validation, its not a glitch, its not anything but the fact that your pictures are ass. Keep this in mind when you inevitably see someone shit on Tinder in the comments of this post or elsewhere on TRP. 

-------

#Step 1 - Understand The Tinder ELO System and how it works

Basically Tinder uses an ELO rating system to ""rate"" each account to judge how attractive the account is based on their swiping and how they get swiped. Obviously, if your profile gets swiped right a lot, you'll have a higher rating, and vice versa. It's not just how people swipe you that determines your rating, but also how picky you are. If you are swiping right on everything, your rating will go down because when you do that you are swiping right on low rated profiles. If you are pickier and only swipe right on higher rated profiles, you'll have a chance for a better score, assuming you are getting swiped right a lot as well. To learn more about how the ELO rating system works mathematically, check out http://archive.is/O07Ad

**TLDR, your Tinder ELO score is determined on the rating/quality of profiles swiping right on you, and the rating/quality of profiles you are swiping right on.**

--------

#Step 2 - Know your competition

One thing I recommend doing, if you have the time, is creating a burner Facebook account as a woman. Use it to make a Tinder account and select that you are interested in men. This way you can scroll through the profiles to see the men you will be competing with in your area. 

A general theory of Tinder is that for brand new accounts, you get a ""noob boost"", which means they are going to show you the higher ELO rated Tinder accounts first, and your profile will also be put toward the top of other user's stacks so they don't have to scroll through many profiles before seeing yours. This doesn't mean every single Tinder account in your stack that you scroll through will be high rated, because remember, there will also be new accounts in your initial stack who are also being boosted, many of which will suck.

Why am I mentioning this noob boost? Because you can use this to scout your competition. The profiles you will be seeing when you do this are generally the profiles the attractive women will be seeing. That way you know what you need to do to beat the competition. 

For the sake of this post I went ahead and did this for my area(medium sized city in the Southern United States). I scrolled through the first 100 male profiles and gave each profile a rating on picture quality(1 being shit, 5 being top tier) and attractiveness(1 being ugly, 5 being top tier) and then I flagged an account if they were not lean.

Settings: Age 18-32, 30 mile radius.

Results: 

* Of the 100 profiles, only 3 of them had what I considered top tier pictures. Most were shitty selfies, bad quality pictures that had grainy or fuzziness in them, bad lighting, or bad poses. Lots of crappy gym selfies and mirror selfies. The average picture quality rating was 1.866 out of 5. That's bad, and shows you don't really need to do much to have better pictures than the rest.

* The average attractiveness rating was a 2.1, not much higher than the picture quality number. And this is supposedly contains the best profiles? I think a lot of the profiles I saw were ""noob boost"" profiles, no way they would be high rated. Either way, I only handed out a ""5"" to 4 profiles, that's 4%, and only handed out a 4 to 3 profiles. That means out of 100, only 7 were what I considered attractive enough profiles a woman would swipe right on.

* 65 of the 100 profiles were not lean, 51 were overweight, and 32 were obese. Once again, shows how much impact being lean has. 

* Average age was 20.9, but the average age of the profiles I gave a 3 or higher to was 24.6. Older guys seem to have a better grasp on this.

**Moral of this story? You really don't have a high bar to clear when it comes to having a top tier Tinder profile. Most guys Tinder profiles suck ass. All you need are good quality photos and to be lean to beat most Tinder profiles out there. Unless Tinder only shows the highest rated accounts to accounts who already have a proven high ELO score and still hides them even from noob boost accounts.**

--------

#Step 3 - Yes, being attractive matters

This is an app where people judge you on apperance. You think looks don't matter? They absolutely do. I am not saying this app is worthless for you if you are below a 7/10 in looks, but you have to reel in your expectations. Women on these apps are pickier than they are in real life, so if you are a 5/10, don't go in expecting to match with 8s or higher. 

Before dismissing Tinder and other apps all together, try to max out your looks first. Lose weight, get lean, lift, dress well, wear the right accessories, sport a good haircut/hairstyle, have a good facial care/skin care routine, and all of that. Doing all of this + taking good pictures will go a long way and can add points to your attractiveness. 

----------

#Step 4 - Pictures are 90% of the battle

I repeat the Ultimate Tinder Maxim: **IF YOU ARE NOT GETTING MATCHES, YOU HAVE BAD PICTURES. PERIOD.**

You are going to sink or swim by your pictures, specifically, the quality of your pictures. Period. I consider myself an attractive man, but I failed at Tinder at first because my pictures sucked. Even if you are attractive, if you have shitty pictures, you are doomed. When I finally put some good pictures on my profile, it was night and day the number of matches and interest I was getting. It became like shooting fish in a barrel. I even got reported to Tinder as a catfish because women thought I was ripping my pictures from models and wasn't who I was in the pictures. 

Now the term ""good pictures"" can mean so many different things. From my experience, here are the elements that make up good quality pictures:

* Picture quality - There is a difference between a shitty cell phone front camera picture and a picture coming from a DSLR or expensive camera. This does matter. Front facing cell phone cameras generally have bad quality, bad apertures, bad lenses, and distort your face. The clearer and less grainy the picture, the better. 

* Lighting - Lighting matters. Pictures taken in the dark will suck because they will have high ISO settings, meaning more grainy. Pictures taken using indoor lighting often cast unnatural shadows with harsher lighting. Pictures taken with a camera flash add 7 years to your face and create all kinds of bad shadows and unappealing flashback. The best lighting is outdoors. The problem with outdoor photos is that generally the sun will be too bright, causing too many harsh shadows, overexposure and your eyes to squint. One solution is to take pictures when its cloudy. Or you can take pictures in the shade(but beware of surrounding glare that causes you to squint). The best time to take outdoor pictures is an hour after sunrise or before sunset, known as the golden hour. You can google ""Golden Hour Calculator"" to determine what time exactly this is for your location. During the golden hour you can take good pictures with soft, golden lighting and yet its not bright enough to cast bad shadows or make you squint. If you are wearing sunglasses it doesn't matter what time of day you take outdoor pics, but generally you don't want to have more than 1 or 2 pics in your Tinder picture album with sunglasses.

* Setting - Where you take your pictures matter. A computer selfie at your desk in your room = shit. A picture of you outdoors somewhere interesting = good. The key here is variety. When I was doing the burner account competition check earlier, most guys are bad when it comes to variety of their settings. Find unique outdoor places to go to. One of my favorite is the roof of a parking garage downtown on weekends. There is no one up there, I don't have to pay to get in, and you get a badass view of the downtown skyline in the background. Parks, hiking trails, mountains, lakes, beaches, rivers, etc. all work. You can also be creative and get shots on the sidewalks, streets, etc. 

* Pose and Posture - You want your poses to be natural based on the setting your picture is taken. If you are taking a picture on a sidewalk, you obviously don't want your pose to be as if you are posing for the camera, you want your pose to be as if you were walking down the sidewalk. Go to YouTube and look up modeling poses for inspiration. And make sure to have good posture whatever pose you use.

* Facial Expression - The key here is variety. You don't want all your photos to be of you smiling into the camera. You don't want all of your photos to be of you looking away from the camera with your mouth closed and a serious expression. I go with the rule of halves here. You want half of your pictures to be smiling, half not smiling. Then half of your pictures looking into the camera, and half looking away. 

* Composition - Where you are placed in the frame matters a lot. You see a lot of guys fail at this when checking out the competition. In my opinion there are only 2 acceptable compositions: Half body shots, and full body shots. Half body shots are generally shots from the waist or upper thigh up, full body has your entire body in the frame. But that is only half the battle - you don't want much open space between the top and bottom of the frame. Use the entire frame. [This is a good example of what I mean in a full body shot, the concept for a half body shot is the same.](http://www.elevatephotography.co.uk/image-view/whole-body-shot) Notice how the whole frame is used, not much gap above his head or below his shoes. [Now here is an example of a bad full body shot - notice how much empty space there is above his head and below his feet.](http://www.photo4design.com/stock-photo-full-body-shot-of-teenage-guy-66071) You want to avoid face only shots because they just aren't flattering and will hide your body, which you want to show off if you are lean, and also hides your fashion, which leads me to: 

*  Fashion/Style - Your clothing choices matter and can greatly enhance your overall look if done right. You want your pictures to show off a diverse variety of well fitting stylish clothes. FIT is the key, more than style. They both greatly matter, but bad fit will ruin any style. A good style can't overcome bad fit. Go shopping to stores like J Crew and wear the smallest size you can that still fits, in a slim style cut if you can find it. Some good ideas for clothes to wear: Dark Wash Slim Jeans, Slim Chino Pants(Khaki is my favorite color), Flat Front Chino Shorts at 9 inch inseam or less, Slim Fit Casual Button Down Shirts, Polos, Well Fitting T-Shirts, Denim Button Downs, Denim Jackets, Bomber Jackets, Leather Jackets, Slim Dress Shirts, Nice Sweaters, Watches(you need to wear one in every photo), boots, dress shoes, loafers, nice sneakers, necklaces, pendants, and bracelets. NO - Cargo Shorts, Cargo Pants, tennis shoes, basketball shoes, ""skater"" shoes, flip flops/sandals, baggy clothes, hats, sweats, hoodies, logo or graphic shirts. You need to be wearing a wristwatch in all your pictures.

* Hair - Make sure you put some effort into it, whatever you do. Find a good haircut/hairstyle for your face shape. 

* Pets - If you have a dog, probably a good idea to have a dog pic. 

* Motorcycle - If you have one, probably a good idea to have a pic of you on your bike

----------

#Step 5 - How to actually go about taking good pictures

So I stated what makes a good picture. But how do you actually do it? There are 3 ways I recommend, all of which are viable and have their pros and cons.

**The Friend With a Camera Approach**

Find a friend to go along with you with a camera and have him/her take pictures of you in various places or settings. Ideally you'll want a friend with a good camera who knows a thing or two about how to take good pictures. Or you could go on Craigslist or something and hire a professional photographer but that can be a bit pricey.

Pros: Lots of possibilities, someone else controlling the camera means you don't have to set and forget the photo settings or placement, good for getting shots at busy places with lots of people without creating a distraction or scene(think downtown locations), cheapest approach

Cons: Less creative control over the pictures, can only be done when friend is available and in that certain time frame, not everyone has a friend who is available or willing to do this. 

**The Tripod Approach**

This is where you buy a tripod to go with whatever camera you are using, set up the tripod and take pictures. I do have a nice camera and a tripod, and have used this approach, but it can be difficult to get right even though I have a remote controller for it because with nicer cameras, it's most ideal to have someone behind the camera to fine tune the controls for every shot.

Pros: Don't need someone else, can do everything on your own time, allows for unique locations to be shot

Cons: Can be expensive, not ideal for high traffic places, tripod can be unstable and knocked over by things like wind, some locations there isn't an ideal place to put the tripod, even with a timer or remote controller it can be difficult to get the right photo settings in terms of shutter speed, aperture and focus

**The Drone Approach**

This is personally the approach I have used over the past year to amazing results. Obviously, drones aren't cheap, but they are worth the investment. Not only can you get some good photos from some unique angles and take them anywhere, but it also gives you a fun hobby as well on the side. I've used both the DJI Spark and DJI Mavic Air drone for this. Both have good cameras, and even better, they have an interval setting meaning it will take a picture every 2 seconds. Meaning 30 pictures a minute. DJI Spark battery lasts about 12 minutes, and DJI Mavic Air lasts about 16-18 minutes. That means you can get 360-480 pictures per battery. Tell me you can't find at least one good picture? You can find a DJI Spark new for $350-$400 in stores or on eBay used for cheaper. Just make sure you get a quality drone, DJI is a good brand. The cheap $50-$100 drones you can get at Wal-Mart won't cut it. 

Pros: Don't need another person, can get all kinds of unique angles/settings/locations you can't get with a tripod, can be controlled remotely, good picture quality once you get the settings right

Cons: Loud, not ideal at all for use amongst places with a lot of traffic/people so you have to find more isolated places, some locations are restricted for drone use, takes a while to learn how to dial in the photo settings like ISO, shutter speed and exposure value that flatter you the most, expensive

**All 3 of these approaches are viable. But one of these 3 approaches have to be used if you want to have top tier photos. Getting your cell phone camera, leaning it up against something, setting the timer and running into place isn't going to cut it. Outstretched arm selfies won't cut it. Cropped group pics won't cut it. Mirror pics won't cut it. Yes, it takes time and effort, and for some of the approaches, investment, but it pays off. Do you want to succeed or not?**

-------

#Step 6 - To shirtless ab pic or not to shirtless ab pic?

From my experience, you can go either way. If you have a shitty body, are skinny or fat, and have no defined abs and vascularity, it won't work. If you have a good body with defined muscles, vein vascularity and a 6 pack, it won't hurt to have a shirtless picture in there. It's not always ideal, though. There *are* girls who will swipe left when they see a shirtless picture no matter what. I've found that shirtless pics work better when you are looking for hookups, not so much when you are looking for dating/something longer term. 

If you want to use a shirtless pic, there is one rule: **IT HAS TO LOOK CANDID.** Shirtless mirror bathroom pic = NO. Shirtless gym selfie = NO. If it looks like you are posing for the picture, and therefore it was planned, its not going to work. It has to look like it was taken candidly, unplanned, as if you were doing something, and someone happened to take a picture of you. The shirtless picture I had the most success with was one of me at the park holding a football, I made it look like I was playing football, even though I was there by myself and used my drone to take the picture. However, I made it come across as extremely candid, even though my 6 pack and vein vascularity and muscles were showing off. Shirtless pics at the beach or pool also work. 

---------

#Step 7 - Post Processing/Editing

You don't want to just use the pictures as they are. You want to find your best ones and then edit them. Use editing software(Adobe Lightroom is good, the stock Windows photo software is good, I am sure iPhoto is good) to mess around with the pictures. Apply filters, change the brightness/contrast/clarity/saturation, and all of that. The key is to not go overboard with the filters and everything. You still want it to look natural. The editing will add to your photo, not make your photo. Women will know if your picture is edited too much. Edit it in a way where it looks a lot better than the original, but at the same time you can't tell it was actually edited. 

---------

#Step 8 - Selecting Which Pictures to Use

The generally key, as I have already stated, is variety. You want your 6 pictures to give a well rounded perspective of who you are.  Variety in terms of poses, facial expressions, outfits, and locations. 

Obviously you want to pick your 6 most flattering pictures. The best approach to use is to pick 6 locations and outfits and take a shit ton of pictures at all 6. Then pick the best from each group and there are your 6. 

Your lead picture needs to be your best one. It needs to clearly show your face and your body, uncovered eyes(no sunglasses) with clothes on(no shirtless pics as your lead), by yourself(no group pics). Your last picture also needs to be a good one, as if a girl is swiping through your pics, will be her last impression before she decides to swipe right or left on you. Remember, she will judge you by your worst pic. 

I'm not going to post my profile, but here is a breakdown of my pictures:

* 4 of 6 I am smiling

* 3 of 6 I am looking at the camera

* 2 of 6 I am wearing sunglasses

* 5 of 6 are full body shots, head to toe

* All are taken outside

* No shirtless pics that I am currently using

* 2 of 6 I am wearing flat front chino shorts, 2 of 6 I am wearing jeans, 1 of 6 I am wearing khaki chinos, 1 of 6 I am wearing dress pants

* 2 of 6 I am wearing a v neck t-shirt, 3 of 6 I am wearing a casual button down shirt with the sleeves rolled up, 1 of 6 I am wearing a dress shirt with a tie

* 2 of 6 were taken in broad daylight(both sunglasses pics), 3 of 6 taken at sunset in the golden hour, 1 of 6 taken in broad daylight but in the shade

* Locations Used: Beach Sand, Downtown Sidewalk, Work(Outside), Top Level of Downtown Parking Garage, Football Field, Side of Building

* Poses Used: Sitting on Cooler, Leaning Against Pole, Leaning Against Wall, Walking With Football in Hand, Standing Straight Up Smiling Into the Camera, Looking Over Shoulder

* No Group Pics or pics with others. Group pics are overrated. Yes, it shows you having fun with friends, but generally they are not flattering and the cropping you have to do ruins the quality. I'd rather have 100% control over my pictures from start to finish. If your pictures are good enough she won't give a shit if you are alone in all of them. 

----------

#Step 9 - Your bio. Does it even matter?

In general, your bio doesn't matter. She really only looks at your pictures which are all that matter. If your pictures are good enough, then she might glance at your profile just to make sure you are a real person. 

Your bio will not help you at all. It can only hurt you. Since you have all to lose and nothing to gain, you need to keep your bio short and to the point. If you are over 6 feet tall, list your height. If you are 5'10, say you are 6 feet. Put where you are from, what part of town you live in, and about 3 or 4 things you like to do. Put the college you graduated from if you have graduated. If you have a cool job, put it in there, otherwise be either really vague with it or don't put it in there at all.

Example Profile that works: ""6'1, from New York, living here in Florida in West Miami. Ohio State '13. Fishing, traveling, fitness, and more.""

There. That's all you really need. Nothing in there that will scare anyone away or devalue you, but makes you look like a real person. Don't try to put anything witty or funny or out there. Just keep it simple. 

----------

#Step 10 - Deploying your Profile and Using Tinder

Don't set up your profile until you are absolutely ready to start with your full profile because once you set up your profile you are put in others stacks. If you already have an account, delete it so you can start over. Upload your pictures, write your bio, and where you go from here is up to you.

**Swiping**

Be picky. Only swipe right on girls that you are certain are who they are in their profile. If she only has face shots, chances are she is fat. Remember the rule: ""If you got it, flaunt it"". Girls live by this. If they have a good body, they will show it off. If they have good tits or ass, it will be shown off. If it looks like they are hiding something, they are. Read her profile, don't just look at her pics. Chances are you might like her pics, but then you look at her profile and it will state she is a single mom. Generally, if you have been swiping a while and have reached the point of the stack where all the girls are ugly, and then you come across one that is hot, chances are she is either a bot or single mom. Because legit hot girls who aren't single moms or don't have major red flags will never be that far down the stack. 

Being picky also helps your ELO score, which increases your chances of being shown at the top of the stacks of the more attractive women. 

**Super Likes**

There are two trains of thought on Super Likes. One train is that its good, it will make her think longer about you. The other train is that its creepy and too much and shows her you are already too interested. 

My take? Use them. I've had more good than bad from super likes. Not only that, but using a Super Like automatically puts you at the top of her stack, so you know you will be seen next time she logs on. Unless you have Tinder Gold, you only get one per day so use wisely. 

**Tinder Gold**

I am a fan. I only recommend, however, using this on a month by month basis. I think its a good investment to use your first month. The queue which shows who has liked you is helpful and will help you gauge how good your pictures are. If its not filling up you have shitty pictures. Also the quality of girls liking you will also help you see what type of women is finding you attractive. Lastly it helps because it helps you ground yourself to reality. A lot of girls don't log into Tinder that much, so by seeing who has already liked you, you won't get your hopes up for girls in the stack who may or may not be active(Tinder hides profiles inactive more than 2 weeks). 

If you are successful at Tinder I think its worth it to stay on Gold after your first month. I do. The passport feature is useful for traveling, as you can arrange meetups with girls before you even get there. This is just my opinion though. If you aren't successful, paying for Gold won't make you successful. The best way I can describe Tinder Gold is that its a valet for an already successful Tinder user, it just makes it easier. Seeing who has already liked you might sound like something you don't really need or need to pay for, and while I agree, its actually been more beneficial than I realized. 

**Boosts**

Regardless of whether or not you subscribe to Gold, I think everyone needs to try a boost at least once. A boost puts you at the top of the stack for everyone in your area for 30 minutes. This means you will be seen by everyone who logs on during that time. I get matches regardless but each time I boost it seems like I get a lot more. Boosts help because after a while, unless your ELO score is good, you fall farther and farther down the stacks of other girls Tinder stacks, and you won't be seen. Instead all she will see are high ELO accounts and new accounts getting their noob boost. Women swipe a lot less profiles than men do(since the attractive ones will match with almost everyone they swipe right on) so its vital to make sure you are showing up at the top of stacks. 

Timing is important with boosts. From my experience, Wednesday at 7:15pm is the best time to use it. This is ideal because its before the weekend before plans are set. If you use it on Friday or Saturday girls already have plans. 

You get a free boost every month if you have gold, otherwise its $4 each.

**Bots**

Obvious bot accounts are obvious. Their pictures are often cropped and low quality but of really attractive women in generic poses/settings. Their bios are often empty or extremely generic. And they often only have either 1, 3 or 4 pictures exactly. They are pretty easy to spot. 

**Instagram/Snapchat Follower Farmers, Sugar Daddy Seekers and Venmo Scams**

You'll see girls on here who are clearly only doing it to rope in instagram/snapchat followers, or find a sugar daddy, or get money sent to them via Venmo. 

Here is my take on them. Yes, that is what they are doing. However, for the right guy, they will throw that away. Use the Brad Pitt test here. If she saw Brad Pitt had matched with her on Tinder, you think she would just try to use him for Venmo money or to get an Instagram follow out of him? No way. 

If you think you are attractive enough, go for it anyway. Generally these girls obviously fishing for Instagram Followers or Venmo money should be massive red flags automatically disqualifying them from anything above plate material, but its possible to bust through the massive shit test. I've done it multiple times. 

-----------

#Step 11 - You've matched, now what?

So you have matched. Ideally with multiple women. 

As successful as I am at this, I would still say only about 10% of women message me first(and many women who message you first will be bots if you were unable to detect them prior to swiping). You are going to have to do the initiation. 

Fuck that shit about message timing, when to message her, etc. ""If I message her too soon after matching she will think I am desperate!"" No. Just message her when you feel like it. 

The key to an opener is to be different, set the frame, use her name, and play on her emotions. I've watched girls use tinder before and pretty much every guy either opens them with a boring ""Hey"" or ""Hi"", or uses some really stupid cheesy pick up or sexual opener that is just awkward. None of that is different, none of it sets the frame in the guy's court, and none of it plays on her emotions in a positive way.

It has to be organic. Review her profile and pictures, and try to craft a message based on that. Don't compliment her physically(i.e. you're hot or you're cute), don't get sexual in the first message, or use a dumb pick up line. 

Here is an example I used recently that worked. It was a profile of a nurse who said she worked the overnight shift and lets say her name was Anna.

>""Anna, are you a Waffle House or IHOP kind of girl? Since I am guessing those are the 2 places I would have to choose from to take you with that schedule...""

See what I did here? I did a lot of things. I set the frame as one that I will be taking her out(not necessarily to Waffle House or IHOP). I crafted the message organically based on her profile, and I made her laugh with the Waffle House/IHOP reference since those places are pretty sketchy in the AM hours, but people secretly love those places. I also gave her a reason to respond.

Here is another example of a girl who had a picture of her bowling, lets say her name was Tina:

>""Tina, if we go on a bowling date, I am not letting you use the bumpers, so you better learn how to bowl without them""

Again, I set the frame from the first message to one that I would be taking her out without asking her out. I teased her about her bowling skills and gave her a reason to respond(to defend her bowling skills). We did go on a bowling date when all was said and done. 

**It's a numbers game**

You are going to have girls who don't respond. You are going to have girls who unmatch. You are going to have girls who take forever to respond. You are going to have girls who are just not into it even if they respond. It's really a numbers game. The more girls you open, the better chances you have at least one who goes through with it all. Don't get hung up on any one girl. Assume every girl you match with will ghost you. Assume every girl you talk to will eventually stop. Assume every girl who gives you her number and you set up a date/meet with will flake. Don't get invested. Persistence is the key. 

I think this is where most guys get discouraged and come here to write their **OMG TINDER IS SHIT** posts. They have shitty pics, and only match with 1 or 2 girls, have no abundance, and when it doesn't work out with those 1 or 2 girls whether they don't respond, stop responding, flake, etc. they act like Tinder is shit and all women on there are shit. You have to remain persistent. Keep in mind the better you look, the better your pics are, the more attractive you are and better your text game is, the less likely she will flake, and the more likely she will respond and follow through. I can attest to that. Remember that girls have dozens of matches and are only going to bother with their best ones. 

---------

#Step 12 - When to ask for her number/ask her out?

So you have had a successful opener and started a conversation. When do you escalate to get her number or arrange a date/meet up?

Every girl is different, from what I have learned, so there is no one size fits all plan. Some girls want more rapport and chit chat before they are comfortable giving you their number or setting up a date. Others require less. Regardless, you need to at least try to get a number or set up a date in 5-6 messages or less. Remember, she has dozens of matches, with guys who are farther along the process than you probably are, so you have to shit or get off the pot eventually. Plus she will get bored if you don't go after what you want. 

The best way to do it is to have the conversation naturally flow into you asking for her number or asking her out. Here is an example that I used, of a girl who actually messaged me first:

>Her: Hey! How was your weekend?

>Me: Pretty good. You?

>Her: Nothing too exciting lol. Lots of work.

>Me: Well we need to fix the nothing too exciting part. Let's go get some drinks, when are you free

See how I took her response and turned it into escalation. You already have the IOI, otherwise you wouldn't have matched, so why waste time? I did it on message #2. You need to look for the opening to make it flow naturally to asking for her number or asking her out. Sometimes that takes longer than 2 messages, but you get the idea. You don't want to go too early though, then you just come across as a player/needy/desperate. 

The worst thing you can do is just make her your pen pal and ask dozens of interview style questions without escalating. She is not an idiot, she knows what you are there for. If after 5-6 messages or so you still haven't found the opening to ask for her number or ask her out, just do it. 

---------

#Step 13 - So you've got her number and set up a date, now what?

Try to set up a date within 1-3 days of getting her number/asking her out. Anything longer she will probably flake. The only times I have successfully set up dates longer in advance is when she was out of town. 

From there you need to shut the fuck up and not contact her until the day of the date, where you confirm plans. Don't text her, don't become her penpal. All you can do at this point is hurt yourself. 

If she initiates with you and texts you, respond to be polite, but space out your responses. I'm talking, take 12+ hours to respond. I had a girl who was all over me from the time we set up a date to the time we met up, always texting me. I didn't want to be rude so I would respond, and I thought that since she was the one initiating, I was fine. Wrong. We go out and then after the date she says she ""wasn't feeling a connection"". You'll never live up to the standard you set by texting her. You have nothing to gain and everything to lose. Resist the urge to text her until you meet up. 

If she flakes, she flakes. It happens. Don't become invested. If she is truly interested she will propose a counter time. Just because she cancels doesn't mean she isn't interested. I had one cancel on me and I thought it was over and I needed to move on but she rescheduled with me.

#Does this approach also work with Bumble?

Yes. The difference is that she will open you, so you can take her opener and play with it. That doesn't mean its any easier or harder. 

My problem with Bumble is that the userbase is smaller, and there are so many inactive profiles on there. Unlike Tinder, Bumble doesn't remove/hide profiles that are inactive. I was using Bumble and saw the profile of a girl I work with who was married a year ago. She said she hasn't logged on there since 2015. 

Also you will match with girls on Bumble and they still won't message you. Again, girls get tons of matches so they will only message the cream of the crop. Become the cream. 

The upside to Bumble is that the quality of girls are higher.

#Conclusion and Final Thoughts

* Tinder/Bumble/Online Dating is 99% pictures. They have to be outstanding. Not good. Not great. Oustanding. How much you want to invest in getting outstanding pictures is ultimately up to you because it takes effort and time and in some cases money. Just remember. If you aren't getting matches, its your pictures. End of discussion. It's not Tinder screwing you over, its not shallow women only looking for validation, its not women having you outside of their Tinder preference settings, its not anything but your shitty ass pictures. 

* Your approach if you are looking for hookups and your approach if you are looking for something more long term has to be different. 

* It really is a numbers game. I know this sounds cliche but the more matches you get the more your odds are in favor of at least one working out. You get more matches by having good pictures and utilizing features like boost. Tinder might seem like a lost cause if you only get 5 matches and none of them work out. But if you have 50 or 500 matches you're going to have matches that work out, its the law of averages. 

* Don't get your hopes up on any one individual girl until you actually meet up with her in person. From there you apply TRP to prevent the onset of oneitis.

* Don't match with a girl unless you are 100% certain she is who she is in her pictures. Read her entire bio and look at all her pics before matching to find red flags. 

* Tinder Gold in my opinion is useful if you are already successful at Tinder, but it won't turn you from unsuccessful to successful. 

* I've seen false advice given around TRP that the opener doesn't matter, if she is attracted to you she is attracted. While attraction does matter the most, you still have to give her a reason to engage with you, invoke her emotions and set the frame. 

* Shit or get off the pot. She has dozens of matches and dozens of guys doing the same thing you are doing. If you don't make a move, another guy will. Build some short rapport and then find an opening to ask for her number/ask her out.

* There is inevitably going to be someone in the comment section saying you don't need Tinder or dating apps, all you need is day/night game, Tinder is shit. What if I told you, you could do **both**? mindblown.gif",2018-06-02 01:09:10

My immediate response to them has now become what I put in the title of this post.


I go to a gym with about 3000 members, probably the biggest one in my city. This particular gym has this stigma for being roid central, as it houses quite a few pro bodybuilders and high end Instagram models, mixed with power-lifters who've been pumping iron since they could walk. Stepping foot inside the building can be a very daunting thing for newcomers as they feel they're immediately placed at the bottom of the ladder. 


Here's the thing though, something that is one of my favorite aspects of joining a gym. Despite what is taught outside the gym walls, once you walk inside, 99.9% of the time ***no one could care less*** about your size, muscle build, appearance, or the level of progress you are at. The only people that will give a shit about you are personal trainers, and that's only because they're paid to. In fact, the only point where most regulars would acknowledge your existence would be their first glance at you, and most of the the time this will consist of them thinking *""Good for them, good to see people trying to improve themselves,""* before they get back to whatever they were training.


Remember, everyone in a gym shares a common goal: to improve *their* fitness. Most are too focused on this goal to even consider for two seconds if you are sharing that goal with them.

What happens? 
+ 268 points
> I want to point out that what you did is classic parental alienation.I don't care if she banged every pizza boy for 10 zip codes. You need to separate her actions against you, with her rights and duties as a parent to her children.

>You have violated her parental rights. You need to make some amends.

Great fucking legal advice! Just what this guy came here for. To hear some armchair neckbeards talk about how his wife is the victim and this idiot goes so far as to saying that he needs to make AMENDS with a potentially hostile woman.

And then there's the classic projection from White Knights, Incels, and SJWs.

I know right? That woman shouldn’t be threatening the father of her children! Oh, wait, you think the woman threatening to kill someone is the victim...because the actual victim dared tell his kids the hard truth when they asked?

Legal advice is a shithole.

And now [here's](http://archive.is/px52X) the original BOLA thread. Another thread filled with classic assumptions. LAOP talks reasonable and is coherent in his tone, he MUST be a narcissistic abuser and manipulating asshole and the wife is a victim! Everyone even going against this is down-voted.

Then OP posts an [update](http://archive.is/2zKAM). He confronts his ex wife in a reasonable manner and offers her a way to repair her relationship with his kids. He even tells them about how he was not the ""best lover"" and that she should be forgiven and that he ""forgives"" her.

[bestoflegaladvice](http://archive.is/BTLaJ) continues to maintain that OP is a psychopath and a manipulative jerk who has ""hurt"" his kids. 

> LAOP is still insufferable. Those poor kids :(

Clearly. The father responds in the thread, presenting himself in an eloquent and organized manner. He even attempts to repair the relationship between his ex and his kids. 

Apparently the kids are ""unlucky"" to have such a caring and kind father. He should have lied to them forever. Lying fixes everything right? 

""I believe I handled this perfectly."" isn't very humble.

Sure, that was cocky. Better call him a sociopath, then!!! Better say that he thinks he's a God!

Like those statement aren't extreme and overly confident in one's abilities to judge character.

>Of course he isn't an angel. What a stupid concept. And he's admitted as much. So why are you castigating him so hard for not being fucking angelic? You've been frothing at the mouth over this guy's story, calling him a monster. Where's your halo?

Downvoted. Why? Because apparently OP is supposed to be this infallible angel and the poor womyn is being oppressed by such a kind father who, supposedly, forgave her cheating and even tried to help her repair her relationship with the kids.

> You can even go to church everyday before breakfast, but what you told here is just awful. You think you are a type of God who can manipulate the emotions of your kids. You are even a worse parent than one that cheats. Thats why you got so many downvotes. You arent seeing reality.
Again, this is what you considered to share. Im scared about what other terrible things you do to those poor kids. Instead of helping them. Terrible.

Oh, and how could one forget! The infantilization of two teenagers. Apparently they should be kept in the dark about why their world was shaken to the core. Apparently, they are too young and stupid to understand that their mother was a whore and that their world was shattered because of it. And supposedly, they aren't able to think for themselves and are clearly being manipulated by, as armchair psychologist eloquently puts, a sociopath. 

And people wonder why men face difficulty in family courts.

16,The main lessons I've learned after 3 years of implementing TRP,2050,0,2050,71698e,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/71698e/the_main_lessons_ive_learned_after_3_years_of/,175,1505885003.0,"First off, a big thanks to all the mods, vanguards, SCs, and ECs for the outstanding content and keeping this sub on the rails despite the increasing new traffic. 

A bit about me, I started 120 lbs & 5'9 soaking wet when I found this sub. My days consisted of smoking weed and playing video games all day when I wasn't working at my shitty dead end job in the food industry. No college, no girlfriends, no social life, just a never ending cycle of wake up depressed, drown it out with weed and video games, staying up til' I couldn't keep my eyes open. Rise and repeat. I could go on in detail, but you already know what I'm going to say cause most of you have been there. 

Now here's where I brag. I quit smoking weed entirely, moved 1000 miles away from my hometown to a coastal city I love, I'm the happiest I've ever been at [180 lbs](https://imgur.com/a/xopC8) with dedicated lifting habits, a great new career with huge potential, and success with girls everywhere I go (5 plates currently spinning with more in the works)

I want this post to be about helping newbies transition from learning all this wisdom and information to **APPLYING IT** Here are the main points that I learned and applied that got me **RESULTS**.

**1. Discipline yourself to take action.**

The most important of all lessons. None of what you read here matters if you don't do anything with it. My best results happened when applied a little knowledge at a time, not trying to overwhelm myself with too much change too quickly. [Baby steps.](https://youtu.be/p3JPa2mvSQ4?t=53s) For example, if your lacking in the fitness department, start with a monday wednesday and friday routine with [5x5 stronglifts](https://stronglifts.com/) for a month, before upping to a 4 day split for 3 months, before upping to a 5 day split for 6 months, before upping to a 6 day split or [PPL](https://www.muscleforlife.com/push-pull-legs/) for a year. Another example, for 2 weeks, just start saying ""Hi"" to people when you walk past them or make eye contact with no expectation of a conversation starting. Then for another 2 weeks start saying, ""Hey, how's it goin?"" again, not expecting any conversation to start. Then 2 more weeks of ""Hey, how's it goin? Crazy game last night, huh?"" This time allowing a 30 second conversation to occur. And so on and so forth. You have to make yourself do the things you know you need to do. You *WILL* thank yourself for this. The grass *IS* greener on the other side of hardship. 

**2. Learn to speak up about what you want and start fucking saying NO.**

This world is your oyster, you're a [legendary sexy space christ sent from mars to lead the normies to a fun and interesting life that doesn't suck.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHi9mKq0slA) Boss wants you to stay an hour late so it fucks up your workout schedule? ""No, can't tonight"". Friends wanna go to some lame ass hipster bar filled with green and pink-haired feminists, ""Fuck that shit bro, we're going bowling."" Friend doesn't wanna approach 2 cuties with you cause he's a pussy? Go approach and bring them over to introduce him anyway. One way or another you have to make this life enjoyable and fun **FOR YOU**. Stop giving a fuck about others intentions and start carrying out your own wants and desires. Others will follow and want to follow. I promise you'll be happier and as a bonus, people will respect you *MORE* for it. It is your mother-fucking job to get out of life what you want from it. Act like a king and go for it.

**3. Be bold, confident, and cocky**

[Is this really all that hard?](https://youtu.be/fIaHxQIvy6o?t=59m30s) Hell no.. and it seems fun as fuck. Who else would have the balls to do that? Certainly not the majority of guys in the world who are feminized pussies. I do ridiculous shit like this often, the more bold you are, the more results you get. My personal favorite is making hella witty and sexually charged jokes anytime I'm around a female I'm attracted to. Mixing humor with desire is a strong aphrodisiac for girls. Mix this with calibrated kino and you're golden. Think of it like an exercise in the gym, you're exercising your BOLD muscle. Once it grows, you'll have momentum on your side and others will start to pick up on your IDGAF attitude. Then your social circle builds because you're an interesting person to be around. It only gets better. Before TRP, Even as a complete social-anxiety-ridden mess in social settings, I was confident as fuck in things like video games/chess/music. I would be hilarious over the mic and in-game chats because I was IN MY ELEMENT. I was used to it, it was my domain and I was comfortable. **Seek to make social interactions and meeting people your DEFAULT. Make it your element and something that comes naturally and comfortably to you.** 
 
**4. Take fitness/lifting seriously.**

This has been stressed more times in more threads than I can even begin to count. The wholesome, raw confidence, mixed with the discipline of a strict training regime is *THE MOST* valuable attribute I've gained since I began this journey. I feel like a million bucks in every room I walk into. Rarely is there someone bigger than me, but when I do see someone bigger, I respect them and their dedication. Not jealous at all, glad that they have reached a level I aspire to be on someday. I always make it a point to talk lifting with the biggest dudes at parties and bars. Their eyes light up like fucking christmas because all big dudes love to talk about lifting. Good way to meet alpha buddies too; something the majority of the sub-base here tend to struggle with. Be dedicated as fuck til you reach the point where people move out of your way in heavily crowded areas and you receive the [Nod of Acknowledgement](http://www.urbandictionary.com/author.php?author=%20Unbiased%20Definitions) everywhere you go. 

**5. Embrace discomfort.**

You have to make the connection in your mind that the things that you don't want to do today are your happiness and joy tomorrow. Still haven't taken that cold shower that is recommended here once a week have you? TRY IT. Set an alarm on your phone for 5 minutes and make a game out of it. Pretend your on fear factor or some shit to make it fun. Free increase of testosterone. Still haven't tried the no electronics in the bedroom rule have you? TRY IT. I'll bet you $5 your sleep quality increases.  Still haven't tried the goal of 10 approach-rejections a day before you're allowed to go home have you? TRY IT. I bet you close some numbers and start generating plates faster than you thought. These and many other actions that are recommended here have huge potential and dividends if you would just give them an honest try. Tired after a long day and just want to binge-watch Narcos? No. Fuck that and fuck you. Get off your ass and do one of the above or something you've been ""trying"" to do but haven't ""gotten around to it"". Then you can watch an episode of Narcos before bed as a reward for doing something worth a fuck. 

**6. Women are a lagging indicator**

You'll notice none of these points are about women directly. That's because the only failsafe method to approach TRP is to **Build it and they will come**. SMV Rules all. I'm gonna type that again. **SMV RULES ALL** Fuck your lazy habits, fuck your endless video games, fuck your blue-pilled friends, fuck your shitty oneitis, fuck your ""crippling anxiety"", fuck your shitty sense of dress and style, fuck your bad hygiene, fuck your poor choice in foods, fuck your half assed-workouts, fuck your dead-end job, fuck all of that. This is a results driven world. Get it the fuck done! [NOW LETS KNOCK THIS MOTHER FUCKER OUTTA THE PARK!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQleT6BtCbE)",2017-09-20 05:23:23
17,Your time is your greatest asset. Be selective about how you spend it.,2044,0,2044,8lgs4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8lgs4t/your_time_is_your_greatest_asset_be_selective/,123,1527080687.0,"It took me some time to realize what SMV really meant. On the surface, it boils down to a number on scale of relative attractiveness. And there's definitely some truth to that. However, in order to better understand the concept, I think it's important to break it down further.

----

How is the value of anything in a particular market established? What does every market attempt to capture? Only the most valuable currency known to this planet. Human attention. 

Paying attention to something is a way of assigning value. The quality and amount of attention given determine relative value. And the more you pay attention to someone or something, the more you signal to the rest of the world (and your own brain) how valuable you believe it to be. This makes sense because if this wasn't the case, logically you wouldn't waste your time or energy on that thing or person.

Pre-selection is powerful. When people pay attention to a particular product, it grows in popularity and demands an increase in price. This is why billions of dollars are spent each year on marketing and advertisement. 

Women market themselves through sexual availability and physical appeal. Those who men pay attention to the most have the highest sexual market value. This is fairly obvious. This is why men can easily be attracted to women in seconds, while women generally take longer to become attracted because they seek out behavioral traits that aren't quite apparent at first glance.

When you give your attention away freely, it becomes clear that you don't value your own time. People are well-attuned to sensing this subconsciously. When a man orbits a woman, he broadcasts the fact that her time is more valuable than his, and will therefore supplicate to her whims and emotions. This is such a turnoff to women because women are attracted to *value*. And when you don't provide value, you are of no use to her. 

In the age of social media, women have been inundated with validation from men who don't know the value of their own time. This causes some women to believe that they are much more valueable than they really are. And as we all know, perception is reality.

The trick to this is, if your frame is unshakeable and you truly believe something, reality will bend to your psychological frame of reference because reality is based upon the perception of obvservers.

However, your brain isn't stupid, you can't fool yourself forever. Repeating a mantra of ""I am alpha and tough and all women want me"" is no substute for actual self-improvement. The basis of a strong frame is actually going out and becoming successful, no matter how you might define it. In order to truly believe that you and your time have value, you must improve yourself. Investing money into a product will increase its value. Investing time in yourself is no different. When the reality of your time being valuable is nested in sound logic, when you **know** it to be true, women's emotional reality has no choice but to bend and accept the logically stronger frame. 

As far as human nature is concerned, the man with the strongest frame of reality, the self-actualized successful man, is the man with the highest Sexual Market Value. 

----

The human brain is an excellent servant, but a terrible master. Left to its own devices, it will seek to conserve and hoard energy. In the modern world of excess this manifests as laziness and gluttony. Your natural desires for success are placated by virtual fantasies transmitted through black mirrors in our pockets and living rooms: video games, porn, tv, social media, etc. But these virtual successes are short-lived and unfulfilling. People are so depressed, anxious, and short-tempered these days because they are trapped by *webs* and filtered by *screens*. 

Time will go by regardless. It is how you invest that time which determines your success in life. The more you value your time, the more you will spend it wisely. The more wisely you spend your time, the more valuable your time will become. Its a positive feedback loop.

But you must be selective about how you spend your time. Don't get caught in the virtual web of distractions. Take intelligent action to improve your life and nature will reward you for your efforts. This doesn't mean you must be a slave to productivity 24/7. In order to maximize the value your time provides, relaxation and rest are absolutely essential as well. Optimization requires balance.

It may be a stretch of the term, but I'm of the opinion that life is really just an elaborate shit test, designed to *screen* out the unworthy who aren't strong and intelligent enough to shape reality for themselves. Fortune favors the bold and nature destroys the weak. This is natural selection in action. If you can't figure out how to survive and thrive, nature has no place for you and it will shit on you with no remorse. Nature is amoral and your time is valuable. Act accordingly.",2018-05-23 13:04:47

____
Around two years or so ago. I became attractive.

I’d swallowed the pill a while back, but like most of you, I assumed I was some kind of exception and didn’t lift. Well I kind of did, but had a pretty severe case of fuck-around-itis and no discipline; not to mention an inability to cook and feed myself properly. I made no gains. 

I was redpill aware, and gamed girls, but really didn’t make that much progress. I knew how to pass shit-tests but didn’t get any, I knew what to do with LMR but had no girls in my room. 9s and 10s were actually quite kind to me; I mistook this for attraction, not realising that I’d actually just fallen into the “asexual-child” category women put guys in who are not even considered men, let alone a prospect.  

Eventually the humility hit me, I couldn’t stay deluded forever, and I had to accept it when looking at myself in the mirror. I was ugly.

Now I had been given a few gifts that I was wasting; one was height, no one can call me “tall”, but I’m above the average at least, so, hypothetically, I was at the threshold most women needed to consider me. The other was a not-ugly face. I wasn’t beautiful, I didn’t have a thick jaw or strong cheekbones, but my face was passable; no stand out blemishes or disproportioned features.

I can work with this, I thought. I may not be Brad Pitt but I can scrape through into “attractive” if I work hard enough. 

There were however, downsides to the gifts, and things I didn’t get; my height came with a skinny, ectomorphic body, with an albatross armspan leading to thin wrists and pencil neck. My face can be considered feminine, boyish; more Justin Bieber than Ryan Gosling, weak chin, unable to grow a beard, or even sufficient stubble. My hair at the time was long, thick and gay. My back twisted into one of the worst cases of rounded shoulders I have seen on anyone, with a forward facing nerd neck, video-gamers anterior pelvic tilt, the whole shebang. It was gross. 

I was a 3, if I’m being nice. But at that level ratings mean nothing anyway; anything less than a 7 and you’re invisible to women. 

At the time I still had this magical idea of women, that they were different than us, that they could look past the beauty and be attracted to alpha-personality on the inside, that they didn’t need us to look good in order to want to fuck us, we could make up for it in other ways. That they had better control of their sexual urges and weren’t as visually turned on as us. That they didn’t really enjoy sex like we do and degeneracy put them off; that they were pure, poised beings with grace and innocence.

Lmao. Delusional. 

After years of painful rejections and bitchy put downs, I stopped making excuses and began to accept that I wasn’t the exception; I needed to lift and fix my body in order to become attractive; all the game in the world couldn’t help me if I still looked like a teenage fedora nerd.

So I began to take it seriously.
________________________
I started off as a 3. 

The first thing that happened was my posture sorted itself. Deadlifts and Bent-Over-Rows fixed my forward shoulders within a fortnight. Stretches solved the APT. I was purposefully checking my posture and neck whenever I remembered, and forcing myself upright. It was uncomfortable, sometimes painful, at first, but my body fell into a new equilibrium and settled. I stood up straighter and sat better in chairs; people would notice, a few said “did you get taller?”. I became a 4. 
________________

Next I cut my hair. It used to hang below my ears cos fuck gender norms and short haircuts were for jocks and I liked heavy metal. This time though I told a new barber to cut it short. Men have short hair.

It was a disaster. I was horrified at the boot-camp haircut he gave me, it made my face look even skinnier and gaunter than before.

But I pushed through it, after a few weeks the hair grew out and became scruffy and messy and actually… looked good. I suddenly felt 3 years older and more masculine, looked like an actual male. I began taking care of it better, stopped shampooing it every day like a retard, and after a few weeks of grease it settled into a natural, thick cleanliness. It felt so nice I would just play with it sometimes. 

People commented; “your hair looks so much better this way”. I became a 5.
_______

At this point I was lifting properly. I was going 4 times a week, no exceptions, no excuses, and enjoying it. I wasn’t lifting heavy, and was a bit insecure about my low weight on the bar, but knew ego-lifting was for pussies who hurt themselves. More importantly though, I was cooking properly, and eating properly. I enjoyed this new hobby, cooking, more than the lifting. I was hungry all the time, something I had never known or experienced, and so I grazed throughout the day until I was hitting 3k+ calories consistently. Everything about me got slightly chubbier, and I stopped being able to see my ribs; my face started packing on fat too, and began to take on a more masculine appearance, my skin looked and felt different. A few people said “you look healthier, you look like you’re glowing”. I became a 6. 

____________________

I changed my wardrobe. I’d just hit it big time on a STEM scholarship so splurged out on new clothes. At first I went on reddit fashion subreddits and brought desert boots and oxford shirts and chinos, but I looked like a damn Victorian twink wearing all this. I was very self-conscious going outside because it just didn’t feel right, it was like I was in a costume.

Sometimes I would go out in sweats and a hoodie and trainers and think “wow I actually look kind of badass” like, old women would walk across the street to avoid me. So I adopted the style. I dressed like a black dude for a while and felt much more comfortable; it felt like “me”, and it would hide my skinny frame. Eventually I started finding which colours worked for me, and adding my own personality to the style; things about me from teenagehood I couldn’t just drop, band t-shirts and chucks and vans and flannel. It worked, very well. I got compliments from people on the roadman-grunge hybrid, it felt effortless and suited me, didn’t feel like a costume. I’m young, and stopped trying to dress old. I became a 7.
____________________________
It was at this point I started getting looks from women on public transport. I would hop onto a train and a 5/10 would see me and I’d see her and then her eyes would snap away and I’d be like “weird” and then she’d look again and see me looking and her eyes would snap away again and then she’d fix her hair. Often I would check my face to see if I had anything in my nose or whatever.

This kept happening for a while and I was getting quite self-conscious about it. Was I creepy or weird? Was I dressed funny? Have I got a big nose or ears or something and they just can’t stop looking?

It’s been about a year at this point and I can finally squat my bodyweight for 5x5 and while I still look skinny in clothes I check myself out shirtless in the mirror and am impressed. I moved on from my strength program to an aesthetics program and started actively working on my pencil neck to make it thicker and chest to make it wider. I saw results within weeks. Suddenly my neck was solid and thick and I was stretching my shirts. I’d also picked up bouldering and this pumped up my forearms and back like no-ones business. I became an 8.
___________
It started to become undeniable that women were checking me out. Every time I would get on a train there would be at least one woman who would see me and we’d meet eyes and she’d quickly look away. Then her hand would go to her nose and scratch it or she’d smooth down her skirt or she’d fidget or fix her hair or fringe. I didn’t understand why. Often she’d look back at me when she thought I wasn’t looking again and I’d catch her and she’d snap away again and I started having a lot of fun messing with girls this way. 

I even began to count how much it happened during the day; my average is 6. Some days are better than others, normally after a haircut or during rush-hour. Honestly, if this is what it’s like being an attractive guy getting checked out by women, I cannot even begin to imagine what it’s like being an 18 year old HB9 in public; like a minor celebrity probably. No wonder they’re all so damn entitled and full of themselves, the validation is immense. Or maybe it just gets tiring and annoying after a while. I still enjoy it though. 

Some women would hover nearer to me or turn their body so they were facing me and their feet would point in my direction or they’d begin copying things I did or how I sat. Some just couldn’t stop looking, even if I caught them. There was this one girl, not that attractive, who backed up into me on a very crowded sardine train and started grinding her fucking ass into my crotch like we were in a club. I thought it was an accident at first but got a boner anyway but then she kept fucking doing it and I knew for a fact that she could feel my hardon poking her buttcrack yet she continued. 

It started to become flattering when I would get the looks from really hot women. Girls who I still considered out of my league would stare at me and sneak glances and I’d look back like “wtf you looking at” and then they’d sit next to me or across from me and play with their hair or part their legs or touch the inside of their thighs. Sometimes it would come from older women, cougars and milfs who were much more subtle about it but would also smile at me when I caught them looking. 

Oh yeah, the smiles from women were a big giveaway, women don’t randomly smile at ugly men. 

________________

I was still denying it though. Still sneakily checking my reflection in my phone to make sure I didn’t have anything on my face or a booger. I couldn’t accept I was attractive, not after a whole life of invisible betadom. I was actually getting laid at this point though, with 6s and 7s I met at school, and this would improve my mood and mindset. It began to show in the way I walked, my aura changed and I would manspread or check out girls without giving a fuck. At this point, I’m a 9 to some women. I can’t pull off the whole big and masculine thing, still too boyish, but I definitely got that pretty boy Dorian Gray fuckboy vibe going.

It was when I got these stares from women who were with their boyfriends that I began to get blackpilled. They would sit there holding their boyfriends hands or he’d be diddling away on his phone and the bitch would sneak glances and then get all fidgety. We’d meet eyes and I’d hatestare her and then she’d blush and then start grooming herself and the guy would be fucking oblivious. She would continue to sneak glances for a while until they left, or sometimes the guy would pick up on it and then hatestare me back and then put an arm around his girl or something. I don’t blame him. The whole time all I could think was “stop looking at me whore your bf is right there”.

It’s when I started getting stares from the teenage girls and children, some of them quite clearly pre-teens that it started to make me feel sick. I understand that I look like I could be in one-direction or something but I was not ready for this level of blackpilling. They can’t start this early can they? When I was that age all I cared about was yugioh. Wtf are they doing staring at me? This is wrong, very wrong. Often it would make me so uncomfortable I would get off and wait for the next train.
__________________________


Every time I looked in the mirror I was unimpressed, still fuck ugly and twinky, still and forever small.

Yet the indicators from the outside world were undeniable. I would be walking past a group of girls who were talking loudly and they’d all go quiet and look. Women in my vicinity would get louder and more obnoxious, trying to draw my attention. And still, always, excessive spontaneous grooming from any girl who would see me. 

One girl in the library who I used to check out while she squatted at the gym would plop herself down next to me and sigh loudly. Then she’d keep doing it and then accidently bump into me sometimes or drop things and then sigh some more. Another girl followed me around a party and eagerly fetched me drinks and asked me very personal questions until her boyfriend had to confront me and I acted all oblivious. 

A lot of women conveniently forget to mention their boyfriends around me. I’d hang out with them for weeks or months and we’d chat in class and I’d flirt quite heavily but subtly as I’m good at it by now and she just won’t tell me she has a boyfriend until I either find out myself through social media or I see them together or she’s forced to mention it because we’re in a group setting or one of her friends sabotages her and brings it up. Normally there’s a quick “wtf bitch why u do that” look between the two girls after. Hilarious shit. 

_____

Then you get the betas who are scared of you and treat you like a king. The guys who stutter around you and worship the ground you walk on. You have the guys at the gym who end their sets early if you ask them for the rack because they’re so fucking agreeable they’re scared of telling you they have sets left. There was a dude who basically did my coursework for me for a while, whenever I’d ask him for help with a question he just sent me the full answer and it confused me at first why this guy was bending over backwards for me until I found out he was a faggot and that’s when I realised just how much worship women get from betas; pathetic.

Then you have the betas who are absolutely threatened by you and try to AMOG you at every turn. They get all hyper-competitive in groups, especially with girls, and are fucking loud and obnoxious. I just sit back and let them crash and burn, knowing the golden rule is the more you talk the more faggy you come across. I feel kinda bad for these guys because they’re not attractive and hate you because you are, but they don’t lift or make any real effort and think being aggressive makes them more alpha so not my problem. 

________
Ugly and average girls are super nice to me and give me the sparkle eyes like I’m a god and seem to be happy they’re just in my presence. They laugh at everything I say even when I’m not trying to be funny and stalk my facebook profile with their friends (attested by the random likes on photos posted 4 years ago). Pretty girls go into full on bitch mode as soon as we meet. This never happened before, I was treated like a child before, but still human. Now the 8s and up all assume I want to fuck them (or hope I do) so start shit-testing me from the first word. 

Then there’s the girls who change their whole personality around you and become fake. There’s this histrionic jewish girl in my class who bounces around me and does all she can to try and impress me and is wild and childish but in that attractive way where you know she’s crazy in the sack. It was cute at first so I asked her if she wanted to hang out after class with my friends to smoke weed and so we did and I brought my bro round who is one of my best friends but also kind of beta still and we all smoked and he didn’t really say anything embarrassing or cringey he’s just kind of shy and doesn’t lift and this whore went into full on beta shaming putdown mode on the dude and made fun of him and laughed. It made me SO angry that she could so easily flip between submissive sex kitten to ice queen sneering maneater, especially to my best friend, and so I caught that shit and stopped it as tactfully as I could in the situation then ghosted her. 
_____________________
At this point I’m actually getting laid a lot, from women who meet my standards, and it’s hard not to start hating women and just how fucking degenerate they can be. I started off being scared of women; thinking they were smart little princesses with sweet smiles, and they terrified me because they seemed to see right through me and had this magical, ethereal power of intuition. Now I know that was just me projecting my own weakness and insecurity and actually they’re all fucking stupid and malicious and irrational.

Before trp I didn’t hate women. They baffled me, they confused me, they scared me, but I didn’t hate them. I treated them with “respect”, which really meant I kissed ass and sucked up to them. I didn’t get laid.

Now I get laid, and I hate women. Now they piss me off. Now they frustrate me. Now they disappoint me. Now I’m a misogynist.
________
I’m not a woman hater due to inexperience like the feminists think so, in fact when I was inexperienced I treated women better than I ever do now. It’s precisely because I deal with the prettiest and smartest girls on the daily that I’ve come to the conclusion that they’re all fucking retarded. All of them. If they’re pretty they’re a whore. If they’re smart they’re also a whore. The “smartest” girls I know are the biggest sex addicts and wildest in bed. If they’re not a whore they’re normally ugly, or just fucking dopey, or incredibly bitchy and hard to be around. 

Oh and “boyfriend”. Lol. That word means nothing to pre-wall women. Or at least, it doesn’t mean what we think it means. It means companion. It means backup option. It means fashion accessory. It means status symbol. To be paraded around and make other girls jealous. But it definitely does not mean “exclusive sex partner”. The “boyfriend” is a term for the baseline, comfortable branch she’s sitting on at the moment while reaching for a higher-chad, at the slightest hint of confirmed upgrade the dude is dropped. Closest translation to trpSpeak is “main plate”. There is no such thing as a girl who is 100% exclusive to her man, they all cheat, and often without thinking about it, never ""on purpose"". They don’t see it as cheating, it's just normal to them, they feel entitled to it. Their definition of cheating changes with their whims and the weather. I’ve banged way too many girls with boyfriends to ever take the “I have a boyfriend” shit-test at face value. 

You’ll be surprised at the things girls tell you when you’ve just pounded her into an existential crisis and she realises you’ll never actually commit to her, you know she’s a whore and accept it without judgement. She’s honest in that moment. The n-counts they reveal… the experiences they’ve had, and the way they speak about their boyfriends, or orbiters… With utter contempt! With revulsion, mockery! I’ve had more than one girl lay there telling me about the size of another guys dick or how much of a pussy he is or laughing about when he cried or did something embarrassing and it made me fucking sick. 
________________
I’ll be laying in bed after having cum in some girls asshole and she’ll sigh as she picks up her phone and there are 20 ignored messages from her orbiters and I’ll sometimes look over and it will be something like “sorry for getting all emotional yesterday I was drunk lol, wanna get lunch today?” and she’d be like “not today sorry xxox” and if only the dude knew that she’s laying on my chest scratching my balls with her other hand while typing this. Sometimes I’m pounding a girl with a fistful of hair and her phone keeps buzzing and it’s her boyfriend and I say “aren’t you gonna get that” and she says “nah just ignore it” and I say “it’s distracting switch it off” so she switches off her phone.

And then you have the ones who are all sweet and innocent and demure and shy and have the perfectly cultivated family oriented social medias and aesthetic photography instagrams yet are in an uber to your place at the slightest hint of a booty call and eagerly tongue swirl your asshole while you browse reddit on your phone.
_________________________
The wool is no longer over my eyes. It has been burnt away violently. They’re all whores. All of them. women on the train who stare without shame. The MILFs who brush their tits up against you. The teenage girls who think they’re being sneaky taking snapchats of your manspread. The girls who kiss you while their boyfriend is in the other room at the party. The girls who sit in front of you during lectures and bend over and turn around a lot. The girls who take selfies for their boyfriends while their lower half is grinding on your dick.

All of them. Without exception. All it took for me was to get attractive and suddenly I’m in a completely new world, an entirely different fucked up game where the true nature of the female sex is revealed. Becoming Chad was the best and worst thing that ever happened to me. Sure I wasn’t getting laid before but at least I had faith in the “fairer” sex and my world was more pleasant. The illusion was nice to uphold for a while… but now that it’s shattered I’m left with a disgusting, stark, reality that I didn’t sign up for. I didn’t want this shit, send me back to the Matrix please.

___

You don’t get hit by the anger phase just once, it comes in waves. Initially when you swallow the pill, but multiple times after that. The first time you fuck a cute little thing and she treats you like a sex-god only to realise you’re actually her plate and she treats every other guy this way too. The first time you accidentally meet the kids of that woman who’s face you cum-splattered a few days before. The first time you get given an STD by that small innocent girl you met at the art gallery. Each time you’ll get the surge of rage. Why the fuck do they have to be like this? How can they ALL be like this, yet uphold the good-girl image so perfectly and sweetly? They’re all fucking whores. They’re all damn liars. 

The sex isn’t worth it. After overindulging as Chad for a while it becomes boring. Meaningless. I don’t want to use these girls as fucktoys, I hate it. And even if I stopped, some other guys will use them anyway. I just wish they’d all stop being lying fucktoys period. Can’t we just have enforced monogamy again where everyone fucks only one person their whole life and sex isn’t a big fucking deal at all? Where we understand the destructive nature of sex as a drug and keep it under control?

Yes I know it’s delusional and beta of me and imma get the spergs like “still bluepill, still anger phase why r u endosrsed u retard, just deal with it enjoy the decline blab la bla” but fuck man, if you’d seen what I’ve seen you wouldn’t just be able to cope with this shit and remain a bystander, it’s sad what’s happened to our women. They’re not the enemy, they’re not something to be used and enjoyed and thrown away, they’re our sisters and mothers and daughters…“enjoy the decline” is for hedonistic, nihilist losers, faggots who assume they have no power in the world so just fucking give up trying to change it.  

I became attractive to get girls, I became Chad, and the world I was inducted into horrifies me. I want out.

I have a subreddit. Link in my profile.",2018-06-14 20:17:54
19,My buddy's newfound success caused his (now ex) girlfriend to lose her mind.,2028,0,2028,7u0msk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7u0msk/my_buddys_newfound_success_caused_his_now_ex/,355,1517343644.0,"Last year, my buddy's business took off and he's making a ridiculous amount of money. He makes more in 6 weeks than most people make in a year. It's sick, I admit even I'm jealous of him.


He'd been dating the same girl for 4 years. She has a 'strong personality', he's beta-ish and easygoing, so she often just bowled him over and got her own way. Even so, it seemed like they were happy, they had discussed buying a house together, all signs were pointing to marriage in the near future -- which is why it was such a surprise when he broke up with her 2 weeks ago. 


I finally got to see him last weekend and his side of the story is crazy. When she found out exactly how much he was making last summer, she immediately wanted to quit her job and ""come work for him"" (even though there's nothing she'd be qualified to do). He said no, but from that point onward she regularly pressured him about it -- increasing her demands to wanting to travel the world together on his dime, have him pay off her student loans, etc. 


She started getting unjustifiably suspicious. She wanted to know where he was at all hours of the day, who he was talking to, who he was texting. I remember we'd go out and he'd stare at his phone half the night answering her calls and texts. He basically wasn't allowed to speak to or hang out with girls alone anymore, no matter the scenario.


She basically ruined their Christmas by being standoffish all day because he ""only"" got her a $500 watch. He said by this time they weren't even having sex anymore (!) -- she was just resentful and hostile toward him pretty much 24/7. But that didn't stop her from talking about marriage and trying to guilt him into proposing soon. Every day she'd be showing him expensive cars, houses, wedding venues and travel destinations. All she talked about was money and ways to spend it.


Finally, two weeks ago he woke up at 3AM to find her awake and going through his phone. That was the nail in the coffin; after a huge argument he ended the relationship. She came to her senses and tried desperately to get back together a few days later, ""apologizing and taking full responsibility for everything"", but he (smartly) refused. Now she's been running her yap to all their mutual friends about how ""money has changed him"" and ""he thinks he's too good for me now"". So now a lot of people think he's an asshole. 


I found the whole scenario amusing. If she hadn't altered her behavior, they'd most definitely still be together right now. Most girls would start cooking him 5-star meals and fucking him like a pornstar, yet she basically did the opposite. I don't understand her thought process, it's like the thought of being rich short-circuited her brain. ",2018-01-30 20:20:44
20,How To Talk To Everyone You See.,2018,0,2018,39qnwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/39qnwd/how_to_talk_to_everyone_you_see/,274,1434256370.0,"The trick to starting random conversations is to simply let people in to your interior monologue.

I NEVER think in terms of ""starting conversations,"" but if you hung out with me for a day you would say ""wow, that guy starts conversations with everyone he sees!""

It is because I am *not trying to start conversations.* Rather, I am simply aware that I am a good person, and a smart and social guy –  and therefore I am entitled to enlighten other people with a thought or two from my interior monologue.

When I see a person walking a dog that I think is cute, there is no thinking ""should I say something to this person?"" because I am already telling them that their dog is cute.

When I see an attractive woman in the bookstore, there is no questioning to myself whether or not I should talk to her, because by that time I am already telling her not to buy that Dave Eggers book because Dave Eggers is a terrible writer and she will not benefit from her purchase.

I think genuine self-knowledge and self-awareness goes a long way towards achieving this state of Omni-Talkativeness. When I looked deep inside myself and searched my motives, I was a little surprised by the fact that inside, I am a genuinely good person who genuinely wants the best for people.

**Society implants moral self-doubt within us.** Society teaches us that ""evil lurks in the hearts of men."" That's why I was *surprised* when I looked deep inside myself and found... no evil. No malice. Only a desire to do good. 

Society has lied to you – it has lied to you about who *other people are*, and it has lied to you about who *you* are. Chances are that you hold a few negative beliefs about yourself. Maybe you secretly believe that you're ""selfish,"" or ""bad.""

But look within. Seriously, look. Do you want to kill anyone? Do you want to hurt anyone? Do you want to make anyone cry?

No? Well, then you are definitely *not* a bad person.

Keep looking within. Do you have a desire to help your friends achieve their dreams and live dope lives? Do you have a desire to give sexual pleasure to women you are attracted to? Do you have a desire to become the best version of yourself, and to help your fellow man become the best version of *him*self?

If you answered ""Yes"" to these questions, then I've got news for you, motherfucker: **You're a good person.** Not only that, you are a fucking *insanely* good person. Most people never ask themselves these questions, so they spend their whole lives *wondering if they are a good person or not.* But if you go inside and ask yourself these questions, you just might realize that you **know** you are a good person. And once you've got that level of self-knowledge, *no one can take it away from you.*

If a person assumes I have ill intent, I am not upset: they are simply wrong. I do not have ill intent. Because I have looked inside myself and realized that actually I have only *good* intent.

With that knowledge embedded deep within my ""frame,"" there is no part of me that ""hesitates"" before talking to someone. Since I *know* on the deepest level that I am a genuinely good guy who wants the best for people, there is no reason to even THINK of THE CONCEPT of asking myself if I should interact with someone – because by that time, I am already interacting.

When you have this kind of positive self-image on a *moral* level, talking to other people is the easiest shit ever. Your confidence is absolute, because you are simply aware that there are only two possible outcomes to each interaction, both of which are positive:

* You have a fun chat and never talk to the person again.
* You have a fun chat and wind up developing a relationship with the person and getting the opportunity to make their lives more awesome.

There is simply no negative scenario that can occur.

TBH bros, I think that talking about ""avoiding approach anxiety"" is completely missing the point. That's like trying to put a band-aid on top of a cancerous tumor (the tumor = the subconscious belief that you do not deserve to talk to people, which stems from the subconscious desire to TAKE something from people instead of GIVE them something).

You must travel deep inside yourself and flip an invisible switch. 

You are a person who engages in interactions. The reason you are not ""social"" is this: In your interactions, you have been focused on *how you can benefit from the interactions you engage in*. 

Here is the switch you must flip: To become ""social,"" you must *stop* thinking in terms of *taking* and start thinking in terms of *giving.* **You must start thinking in terms of *how the other person can benefit from interacting with you.* (Trust me, that's the only thing they're thinking about anyway. Once you're thinking about that too, then you're both on the same page.)**

The only questions you should be asking yourself: What do I have to offer this person? What do I have to give? (Friendship? Good cheer? The D?) How can I make their lives more awesome?

When you meet women, often the answer to these questions is obvious: the most effective way you can make their lives more awesome is to give them the D that they thirst for so passionately. When you meet men, the answer is often less obvious – sometimes you can give them knowledge, sometimes you can teach them a skill, other times you can just give them the gift of a few light-hearted observations on whatever is happening.

For me, attaining the state of Omni-Talkativeness is a *moral* journey that is 100% internal.",2015-06-14 04:32:50
21,"Twitch streamer goes missing during a convention, but I bet you knew exactly where she was.

I paid no mind to it when I first saw it like half an hour ago, but I reloaded the r-all, as you often do, and I happened to see the second half of the headline about her: she went missing during a ""mixer."" Well, it kind of just clicked in my head instantly. She probably had a few too many drinks, and you could probably guess what happened next. I was intrigued. So I had a theory in mind as to why she went missing, and it wasn't long before I found that she had already re-surfaced and it turns out that she's fine. I wanted more info, so I kept searching, and lo and behold, she actually has a boyfriend/husband. It took no more than a minute of more searching to find this exchange they just had on twitter.

Need I say more?

My takeaway from this is, a bunch of white knights made it a point to take a non-occurrence and turn it into a national news story, no doubt thinking to themselves what good guys they all are for doing the right thing and helping a damsel in distress. When in reality, the girl in question was just having fun, as girls do, to the point that even her own bf had no idea what happened to her. And he still doesn't.

If he's any good as a man, this should be a glowing red flag that this bitch needs to be dropped. Here's hoping that everybody gets what's coming to them.

*Edit*: I should add that in both of the front-page posts where this topic is covered (primarily where the original call for help to find her was first announced by the random white knight), there are a lot of controversial and deleted posts. The first thread about it that I opened has also been locked as of this writing.

And this topic has been posted on at least 1 other subreddit as of this writing, specifically r-drama. And there you can find some RP comments about it, some that you would probably already be thinking yourself. I highly recommend that you go and take a look. This should serve as an example of the red pill theory stated thusly:

**Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks**

*Edit 2*: [The plot thickens](http://i.imgur.com/QAi1y9N.png)

*Edit 3*: [""She even sounds like she's been deepthroating.""](http://a.pomf.cat/lceuzz.mp4) - She posted this video as confirmation that she's alive and well but later deleted it, probably after she realized that her posting this confirms that she was in a hotel room with *someone* but fortunately, it has been backed up and here for us to see.

*Edit 4*: This will probably be my last edit on this for now, but I found this [twitter reply](https://twitter.com/asmiseasy/status/875628688833773568) where the BF was talking with a rando and she literally said the bitch is now gonna get kicked out no matter what she did. Hope he follows through.

*Edit 5*: Credit to user -Unnamed- for this recap of what has happened so far: 

>""She was supposed to be on a panel at e3 and at a booth or whatever. The day before she got drunk and went somewhere. Then no one heard from her for over twenty hours. As a girl who had an event to attend, tweets fucking constantly, and wasnt even contacting her husband, it was suspicious. The internet took off with it. Later she posted a video saying she's ok and just missed e3. But it was inside some sketchy hotel that no one recognized. So she deleted the video. Then later she posts a video from the road. But it turns out she's not the brightest bulb on the tree because that sidewalk was literally outside the same hotel. So weaponized autism on the internet pinpointed her location using clues from the two videos such as curtains and road signs in the background. Turns out to be some sketchy motel. They called the motel and used the missing persons report to see if anyone matching her description stayed there. They confirmed. Everyone started calling her out on twitter for cheating on her husband until she finally cracked and was like ""we aren't even together anymore lol""

>TLDR; thot blows off fans at e3 to blow off some dude in a motel

If that last part is true, and it has been confirmed that this girl and the supposed bf ""aren't even together anymore"" then this all becomes an even bigger shitshow. Apparently Beta Billy over here still thinks they're together but the missing princess thinks that's a load of shit? I can't even laugh it's so embarrassing.

*Final Edit*: Really glad this got massive attention on TRP, unfortunately our guy just doesn't get it at all.

Rewriting and posting here so more people will see it.*

So you're at the point in life where you feel like you ought to start getting shit figured out, but somehow--almost certainly due to your own ignorance and sloth--things just never started coming together for you, and you spend all your free time playing Fortnite and masturbating. I can't do anything about your sloth, but after reading this post, hopefully you won't be quite so ignorant.

Getting your shit together involves a three-pronged attack.

**ONE: GET YOUR UNDERLYING STATS UP**

Part of the reason you feel so anxious and helpless is because you have it in your head that you're worthless. Maybe not *completely* worthless, but other people your age are miles better than you, and both you and they know it. Before you can start telling yourself, ""Fuck those people, I know I'm awesome"" you have to be somewhat awesome, or at least well on your way there. Your tasks are:

* Take school seriously. Keep those grades high.
* Lift weights. Eat a diet high in protein. Add muscle. Shed body fat. If you're a giant fatass, cut back to one meal a day, low carbs.
* Dress better. Get a halfway decent haircut. I don't care if you decide to sit on your ass all day and not talk to anybody, but you aren't going to look like a total slob doing it.
* Clean up your room, your locker, your car. You might be ashamed of yourself, but there's no reason to be ashamed of the space you inhabit. Stop sabotaging yourself; it's not that fucking difficult to be tidy.
* This can come a little bit down the road, but learn how to cook. If you don't know how to change your oil, you can take it to a mechanic and be pretty sure they'll do a competent job. If you don't know how to nourish yourself, you can go to a restaurant, and while they may do a competent job of making your taste buds happy, they sure as hell aren't going to make sure your body is fueling itself with the correct mix of macronutrients. Learning to make cheap, healthy food taste good will do so much to improve your day-to-day experience that it's unreal.

**TWO: GET YOUR HEADSPACE RIGHT**

Most of you assholes have convinced yourself that you have some kind of depression. Maybe you do, maybe you don't, but either way, your batteries are probably sitting on low. That means you aren't going to want to do much of anything. OK, fine. You're going to have a lot of free time. I don't care what you fill it with, but *stop filling it with crap*. The key is to avoid short-term dopamine hits, because those will make your brain chemistry even worse.

* No porn. No elaborate jack-off sessions. Take two minutes every few days to check that the ol' prostate is still working, then move on with your day; don't weave some elaborate fantasy out of it.
* I'll say it again, no porn. Seriously. That shit rewires your brain. You want to get horny when you see a cute girl your age wearing a nice outfit, not inure yourself to the female form so much that you can only get hard if you're watching a dozen black dudes in horse masks tag-team a pregnant midget. That's what happens when the ""regular stuff"" stops doing it for you. And the ""regular stuff"" isn't that fucking regular anyway.
* No videogames. For most of you, this will be harder to cut than porn, if not downright impossible. So let's say no more than 30 minutes to start with. And if you're going to play, try to play with someone that you know rather than just sitting there alone. The more you start getting your other shit together, the more you're going to realize videogames are a giant waste of time unless they're a social activity. (And the more you start moving in social circles that have successful people in them, the more you're going to realize that winners do other things besides play videogames when they get together, but that's an epiphany for a later date.)
* No caffeine. Caffeine fucks your sleep. Now, you aren't going to be able to cold-turkey porn, videogames, and caffeine all at once, and I'd put caffeine at the bottom of that list, but coffee is a crutch, and nobody learns how to walk--much less run--if they're stuck relying on a crutch. If you're drinking soda, cut that shit immediately, though... it's about the worst stuff you can possibly fuel your body with, and it'll rot the teeth out of your head.
* Get off Reddit. Or at least unsubscribe from subs where the whole idea is to point at people and laugh at how stupid they are. Same thing goes for ""outrage porn"" that reinforces how dumb/evil/corrupt the people on the opposite side of the political spectrum are. How the fuck does that help you get in a frame of mind to succeed?
* Ditto the YouTube videos you watch and the books you read. Watch, listen to, and learn from people that you *admire*, not people that you disdain. There are lots of people out there that do have their shit together, and they're more than willing to tell you how they did it *for free*. In this day and age, the only excuse for not knowing how to do some basic shit is not having the willingness to seek it out.
* Don't binge Netflix shows.
* **YES** to reading, exercise, yoga, walking the dog, hobbies like painting or woodworking where you are making something in the real world, a part-time job, doing chores, writing, volunteering. Stop thinking you don't have time to do stuff. Almost all of you are wasting 4+ hours a day between videogames, Reddit, YouTube, PornHub, and Netflix. If you set yourself a rule to avoid all that crap, you'd be amazed how much of your day still needs to be filled with something. You can make it something worthwhile.
* To elaborate on those last two bullets, do you know how many basic bitches--both male and female--are on dating apps thinking that the stuff that they *consume* is what defines their personality, rather than the stuff they *produce*? It is not to your credit that you like *The Office*. A retarded turtle could like *The Office.* Define yourself by what you're able to *do*, not by what other people have made.
* Get more sleep. That means quality sleep when it's dark outside, not lying in bed until fucking noon. Don't keep your phone or your laptop within ten feet of your bed. Don't read them in bed, ever. If it's 10:30 at night and you aren't tired, that means you should have been more physically active during the day. You can simulate the effect by taking a long, cold shower. Stand under the water until your teeth are chattering, then stay there for another 7-8 minutes.

**THREE: UNCALCIFY YOURSELF SOCIALLY**

Here's something a lot of people don't realize. In the absence of major trauma like going to war or losing a parent (and no, losing a girlfriend is nowhere near being in the same ballpark; women are replaceable), once you've broken through a particular type of social anxiety, it's gone forever. There's little to no backsliding. Exposure therapy is the thing. Go do shit that scares you a little bit. It might take three or four times before it stops scaring you at all, but once that problem is solved it's fucking solved for good.

Go talk to people just for shits and gigs. Tell a stranger at the park you like their shirt. Sign up for stuff that you have a legitimate interest in, even if you suck right now and don't know anybody who'll be there. Work out at the gym and then strip down naked and take a shower in front of people. This stuff if only difficult because you have a mental block--chip away at the block; it doesn't grow back.

Now let's talk a little bit about alcohol and weed. A lot of people will tell you that alcohol and weed will help loosen you up, while other people will tell you that weed and alcohol are vices that distract way too many people away from their purpose. Both sides are correct; this is a nuanced subject.

* Will these drugs open you up socially? Yes. (Though weed can also make you a paranoid wreck and keep you inside on the couch.)
* Do these drugs give your charisma score a boost? No. If you can't talk to women because you have social anxiety but are otherwise an interesting person, alcohol might help open you up. If women don't want to talk to you because you're a boring fuck, alcohol won't help at all.
* Should you go to a social event where there'll be drinking and smoking? Maybe. Is it a chill environment with people you trust? Then probably. If you get caught, are you going to lose your job or get kicked off the track team? Then probably not.
* Are you a giant pussy if you don't drink or smoke? At any one time, no. But over the course of your entire young adulthood, yeah you probably are. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you're a pussy *because* you don't drink or smoke. I'm saying that you're probably a pussy in general, and not drinking or smoking is just a symptom of that. Going out and getting drunk might help you uncalcify yourself socially, but it's a small part in getting your shit together, and learning how to not be a pussy in general is a much more important thing to learn. In fact, if you lean into weed or alcohol too hard, it becomes counterproductive. Speaking of which...
* Is getting high or drunk an accomplishment? No! This is one that took me a long time to learn. In my teens, I was a pussy-ass introvert with social anxiety. As I improved, I found myself with more and more plans to go out on Friday and Saturday nights. At first, getting drunk with friends seemed like a pretty cool achievement, since it was something I never had the balls to do in high school. But as you take stock of What Did I Accomplish This Week, let me tell you, getting hammered doesn't belong anywhere near that list beyond maybe the first time.

**LASTLY**

Don't be too hard on yourself. Don't get lazy, but as long as you're getting better at *something* over the course of any given 3-4 day period, you're on the right track. You don't have to do everything at once. What will kill you is fucking backsliding. Don't backslide. Though inevitably you will here and there. When that happens, don't throw your hands up and think all is lost and go back to the sack of shit you were before. Move past it and keep plugging away. Progress isn't linear. Don't get discouraged. It does get easier. Like they say, nothing succeeds like success. Winning at life produces a positive feedback loop. The more shit you get under your control, the easier everything else becomes.

And to hell with the people who will try to keep you down, but that's a post for another day.",2019-06-17 00:48:04
23,Bullet Points,1855,0,1855,76dlah,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/76dlah/bullet_points/,211,1508032077.0,"Hey guys. I decided to write a post as I've never really contributed but I've taken a whole lot from here.

I ended a 3 year LTR as I wanted to be single, that's it really. It wasn't horrible. She wasn't evil. I just wanted to have sex with a whole bunch of different girls. Turns out using the basics from here, it's real easy.

Me.
Late 20s

I live in a big city.

Own my apartment I live in alone.

Professional job

Muay Thai for about 10 years

Not a lifter but the kickboxing keeps me in decent enough shape. Not a big dude at all. Think ""fighting thin"" 6""1 and about 175lbs. 

On a normal day I'm a 6.5 at my best I'm a 7.

I am writing this as a bullet point list really. I've found dating to be utterly hassle free which has come as a shock to me so I figured I would just pop down some stuff that I've found and hopefully it benefits people. Most of it is obvious / simple. 

Essentially this is a list of practical things with no order or theme. Please add yours in the comments. I don't mention the actual meeting of girls much as to be honest I don't know how I do it really. No set way. Tinder. Parties. Bars (my least successful place for meeting). I don't go to clubs. Friends of friends. Language classes. Just out in the world really. 

1. When arranging dates I always pick a bar near my house and I tell the girls this to make it clear why we are meeting. ""Let's meet at bar X because it's right next to my apartment."" Note the use of BECAUSE. This works well. I go home with a lot of first dates. A couple of them have told me they noticed it and liked the confidence / the leading.

2. Give yourself a chance. Be as attractive as you can be. Trimmed nails. Regular haircuts. Styled facial hair. New clothes. The clothes don't have to be expensive. I bought a 10 pack of cheap plain t shirts. They fit right and look new. That's all that matters. Throw out stuff that you know is dead and should be thrown out.

3. Smell good and have good breath.

4. Don't drink too much. I usually only have two drinks on a date. It also leads to a good line of, ""I'm not looking to drink anymore but I am keen to keep hanging out if you want to come to my place."" People say a girl needs an excuse to come back I. E. Come see my antique Xylophone that I told you about . But I've found just saying this works more often than it doesn't.

5. Condoms. Wear them. It doesn't get mentioned much here but after a touch of chlamydia I thought I would reiterate it. Girl who gave it to me was an upper middle class architect. So, you know, it can be anyone.

6. Have wine in the fridge all the time. Can be cheap shit. Go buy 10 bottles of piss and keep it handy. It's a good excuse to hangout in the apartment. Not for first dates but for second onward. Skip the bar and have her round for wine, if you are late 20s or older and fucking younger girls they like this. A girl under 25 being invited round for a glass of wine makes her feel like a sophisticated grown up. A 21 year old told me this. 

7. Create the picture of a life she wants to be part of. So, girls don't do shit. Generally speaking they have no hobbies beyond texting. They are looking for a guy to show them stuff and take them places or just have things going on. I have a lot of friends. They are cool interesting people. I talk about them on dates. ""Ah that reminds me of something my mate Matt was telling me. This is a fairly disgusting end to a Tinder date story. You in?"" Tell your friends stories. Be someone who seems to hangout with all these awesome and hilarious people. I've travelled the world a fair bit and I find the stories about my friends have more of an impact than any story of trekking through the Vietnamese jungle etc. 

8. Shit tests. I'll agree and amplify if the vibe is right and we are fucking with each other. If we don't have that vibe (yet) and it comes over as her just being mean or being a bitch. I ignore it completely. Act like she didn't even talk. It works better than anything I've tried. A girl had a party at her place. I'd met her that day from tinder and she invited me to the party. At some point she says to me, ""You are maybe half as funny as you think you are."" I saw a girl heading out the door and said, ""are you going to the store? I'll come too, need some more beers."" Then just walked off. So this party hosting girl was some big feminist and would give me shit tests all night, constant nonsense and social justice crap. I ignored each and every one of them. Just started a new conversation with someone else. She wasn't getting the argument she obviously craved. Whenever she was nice, she got attention. She figured it out and stopped being a dick. Depriving her of attention was the worst thing that could happen to her it seemed. She was hot and a lot of her friends seemed like male feminists I. E. Skinny and desperate to please her. We had sex when the party ended.

9. It's an old one here but it is so so true. Text for logistics only. Do. Not. Validate. Her. By. Text. She should have to work for those feelings of attention. Don't let her get her dopamine hit lying on the couch texting you and 6 other dudes. Once I have fucked a girl a few times then I don't mind some bullshit by text. Memes. Links to stuff we have talked about etc. To be perfectly honest if you are doing all this stuff right and sleeping with 3 or 4 different girls on top of having a productive life..... You really won't have time to go back and forward on text.

10. When it comes to the number scale and girls I've found some stuff. Ask out YOUR 10s. So, I had a weird thing for a while. I had no problem asking out a 7. But when I saw a 9/10 I would be intimidated. My 10s are real thin Balkan / Russian looking girls. That's what I am about. Tiny frames. Small tits. So I'd ask out anyone that wasn't them basically as I ""wasn't ready for that."" Turns out.... They aren't everyone's 10. There was this one chick I thought was incredible. My friend likes gym girls. Thiiiiickkkkkk ones. The girl I liked? He thought she was below average. Right...... I should just ask then because if she is a 6 to him and I'm not scared of 6s let's do it. Sometimes YOUR 10s say yes. Ask em. 

11. I have taken loads from here but the one thing I want to give back is that none of it matters. It's just not that big a deal. On this run I've had sex with the hottest women I've ever been with. No 10s. But a a solid run of 7-9. Some stupid good runs as well. 5 in 5 days and things. Know what I felt? At first, excited. Then....... Tired. Then bored of talking to girls. The sex was fine. Good even. Sometimes excellent. But largely inconsequential. I know I can do it now so I actually do it less. I passed up fucking some girl the other night so that I could play PUBG after training. I took a great feeling of pride in doing what I wanted like that. Previously I'd never pass up a chance to go meet a girl. And of course the ridiculous thing is now that I'm willing to pass it up..... They want to fuck more. I'm happy to feel that. I hope if you aren't there that you will feel it one day. I'm actually open to another LTR now. I've met a girl who seems cool and I like being around. If it works great. If not then I know I can go back to living like this. Either is fine. Both have a lot fun moments. That confidence likely makes it way more likely to work I think. Who knows. We're all dying anyway.

Many blessings to you all. I wouldn't dare attempt to field questions. I'm just some idiot who has got ok at getting laid when desired. Hopefully we can chat a bit though and maybe see what other bullet points people add.",2017-10-15 01:47:57
24,Some of My Personal Life Lessons For Those Under 30,1835,0,1835,78n3am,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/78n3am/some_of_my_personal_life_lessons_for_those_under/,336,1508960183.0,"I've recently rediscovered this fantastic sub and wanted to offer some hopefully important advice to those in their twenties and even late teens. Although I am learning every single day I feel like since turning this age my outlook and opinions have dramatically changed. I want to offer these as I go along:

**Chasing Women is a waste of time** Luckily Tinder etc is the norm. Women do not disappear they are always there. Always. If desperate for a bang, drop your standards. But do not under any circumstances focus on it. Yes I got laid a lot, not as much as I wanted to however they are memories you share with your buddies over a beer, and they make you smile for about 1 minute. Thats it. But what I will say is get it out of your system. Fuck around, fuck an asian girl. Fuck a spanish one. Have a ONS. Do it, enjoy it. Then you'll know when you don't have the energy for it anymore that its out of your system unlike the beta that settles for any thing, and you can chill with a respectable LTR. 

**Lack of Goals = Lack of Improvement** WRITE YOUR GOALS DOWN. All of them, and set yourself realistic targets. Do not just say ""I want to lose weight"" say ""i want to lose 5kg in 2 months. Those who do not have clearly defined goals are wandering lost souls. Write your goals down, and stick to them. This will bring you greater pleasure then getting laid a lot trust me. Do not be a male bimbo.

**Going out every weekend** Biggest waste of money, time, energy and so on. I have stayed in on weekends for last 2 years half of it single and had the time of my life. Maybe cos Im 30 but seriously I do not recall one night that was ""life changing"" and so on. Its a load of shit and in the antisocial socialist heavy society we live in most people are insecure assholes in bars etc. So really think about it, on your days off/weekends why would you choose to go to a place full of people that are a bunch of cunts? Go to dinner, get a hobby, improve yourself, work on a project, even play a video game that you can improve on. Going out is finished. Again nobody on their deathbed ever remembers the night they go to the bar full of average to sexy looking women who were rude or might have fucked you. 

**Invest** Real estate, shares, anything that produces income. Do not invest in something that gives you no dividends. Its a load of bullshit.

**There will always be another job, but not another life** If you need income, work, but if you want to be successful work for yourself. I realised at 23 that my bosses at all my jobs were no smarter than me, and I refused to ever work for another incompetent asshole again. Funnily enough 7 years later each one of those bosses have either been fired, company closed or quit. You got one life, do whatever the fuck you want on YOUR terms.

**Do not go to College* Unless you are studying law or medicine, DO NOT BOTHER. Do not get yourself into THOUSANDS of debt, for a piece of paper. Im a college dropout, zero debt, worked for myself, whereas others I know cant even fucking go out as they are crippled with student loans. Do not do it, youre only doing it for the social life, and again thats a bubble not worth staying in for that amount of debt.

**Friends come and go** Seriously the friends I have now to before are chalk and cheese. If you dont like a dude, do not hang out with them. Also like to add, do not socialise with women. They are at their worst right now and are selfish beyond belief. Those who are lucky to use them to get laid etc well done, but majority of us have never been so fortunate. They offer you nothing good at all and I havent had a female friend (that i wasnt banging) for 3 years. Couldnt be happier.

**Assume bullshit** I believed everything I was ever told. We live in a bullshit heavy society. Do not believe a single word. None of it. Whether its in business or socially. Assume bollocks, smile, nod and don't give a fuck.

**Its easier to make money for yourself then ever** A guy I know had no money, no prospects got a business loan and paid it off in 13 months selling fucking burgers for a stand and is looking to expand. Seriously, take the hit, totally worth it.

**Get dumped/Break up** Greatest life lesson ever. Best painful experience too. If you've never had this, you've never lived.

**Delete all social media** Biggest waste of time ever, use it ONLY for trying to bang a girl or promote your business. Anything beyond that do not bother.

**Take the risk** Invest the money, ask her out, do something stupid, put a lot on red, but all within minimum. Ive gone extreme on all this, I've lost a lot of money, Ive done plenty stupid things, i put a lot on red and black came up. Don't regret any of it, lifes too short. But be warned do not overstretch yourself. Dont put it ALL on red, eggs in one basket and so on.

Last but not least **Do whatever YOU want** Your family, friends, spouse, teachers, boss do not know you. They think they do, but they are fucking stupid. You know you, and only you can do what you think is right. Trust your heart, but not what you think your dad would like etc. I'm telling you to be selfish because its not their lives its YOUR lives. 

You can honestly achieve anything in your lives. Seriously, the amount of shit wankers told me and I proved them all wrong is the greatest feeling ever. I want you to know that you will be hated for all of this because it goes completely against the grain. But thats what this sub is about. Its about becoming the man you always wanted to be.

25,Vagina Envy,1819,0,1819,9h1285,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9h1285/vagina_envy/,242,1537351104.0,"We have a lot of posts rightfully scoffing at chicks and their penis envy.

Women are so turned around that they think the path to happiness is by acting like a man.

**The Modern Woman:** *I will become highly educated. I will build a successful career and make lots of money. I will have sex with as many partners as I can*

Women who enter their masculine frame and start acting like men end up miserable and lonely. We all know it, and we clearly see it playing out in society.

But there is a much more nefarious and less-frequently discussed phenomenon that I find much more disturbing.

Vagina envy.

Men are cutting off their own balls, their own masculinity, and acting like they wish they had a vagina.

**The Modern Man:** *I can't wait to find a chick to settle down with. I will sit around doing nothing meaningful with myself, praying for Mrs. Right to save me from my boring life. I want to cuddle on the couch with her and whisper sweet nothings. My greatest ambition in life is to find the Right One.*

Barf.

When our boys stop acting like chicks, maybe our women will stop acting like dudes.

Final thought:

You don't become the King by chasing after the Queen. The Queen comes naturally, as a byproduct of you *being the fucking King.*

So chase the crown, never a bitch.",2018-09-19 09:58:24

The key to personal success is finding the 20% of things that give you 80% of your results and to double down on those motherfuckers. Here is a guide.",1803,0,1803,7ykxcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7ykxcy/life_is_too_short_to_be_a_chump_the_8020_rule/,132,1519052906.0,"Perhaps one of the most elementary and hindering mistakes we make in life is to assume a linear relationship between events and causes in life. The reality is that linearity is not the norm. The 80/20 rule is simply a byproduct of the power laws, logarithmic and exponential tendencies of many of life's happenings. 
In this post, I  will explain 80/20 and how to leverage it in all areas of your life, because life is too short to be a chump. 

[**Watch This**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPwJmtACUO4)

##**What is 80/20?**

The 80/20 rule also known as the Pareto principle or the law of the vital few, is a principle that states that roughly 80% of results are generated from 20% of efforts.

It’s a distribution that was uncovered by an Italian economist named Vilfredo Pareto. Pareto noticed that 80% of the land in Italy at the time was owned by 20% of the population. He also noticed the principle at work in his own garden! 20% of the pea pods contained 80% of the peas. This distribution has been proven multiple times in different sectors since its discovery.

The ratio is not always 80/20, it can be skewed all the way to 99/1 or even bigger ratios.The main idea is that a small number of critical causes tend to produce the biggest effects in almost all area in life. What is important is being able to identify these causes and leverage them to your benefit. 

**Examples of 80/20**

In the video linked above, I go through 3 examples in real time, clearly showing the consistency of 80/20.  The examples I use are The worlds GDP, the population of cities in Australia ( where I am from), and analytics on my own YouTube channel.  ( make sure to check that out ) 

Some common examples often mentioned in the 80/20 discussion are how:

• 20% of criminals commit 80% of crimes ( Think of convicts that keep returning to prison ) 

• 20% of employees account for 80% of the companies success ( Just look at any sales team to see this in action)
 
• You wear 20% of your clothes 80% of the time (you dirty fucker, change your shirt) 

• You walk on 20% of your carpet 80% of the time ( the walk from your bed to the fridge )

• You spend 80% of your time with only 20% of your friends

I must stress that the ratio isn’t always 80/20, but it’s almost always something skewed. 


##**Why does 80/20 happen?**

The 80/20 distribution happens because of the magic of feedback loops. Many people who have owned goldfish can attest to the following observation. You go to the pet store and buy 3 equal sized goldfish; a couple months roll by and the 3 goldfish are drastically different in size. Why is that? Well, naturally when you first fed the goldfish one might have been lucky enough to eat a bit more food than the others. This extra food allows the goldfish to grow slightly larger than the other goldfish giving it a slight advantage when it came to eating food. Over time this advantage gets larger and more obvious until the other goldfish can barely compete, and you are left with one big fat goldfish that just eats all the food the same way that your cousin David does at every family gathering the fat fucker.

Now replace the goldfish with Google or Microsoft and you can see how monopolies are formed. Other factors are involved of course, but this seems to be one of the primary reasons for the ratio. 

##**How to leverage 80/20 Examples for the real world**

Now that you know about the magic of 80/20, let’s go over ways that you can optimise your life using this simple principle. 80/20 is a mindset, being able to see through everything through this mindset will drastically improve your results in all avenues.


##**Fitness:**

Two best friends decide to join the gym to build some juicy muscles and make the king of Iron Arnold proud. 
One of the boy’s trains 6 times a week and focuses on isolating each muscle with specialised movements. He does an hour of cardio after each workout in hopes of getting ripped. He works out for an average of 12 hours per week. He doesn’t worry too much about his diet, and has never counted his calories.
The second boy takes a more minimalistic approach, he does full body workouts 3 times a week focusing on heavy compound exercises that stimulate his whole body. He does cardio only once a week and prefers to focus on high-intensity interval training such as hill sprints. He focuses on the diet keeping track of his daily macronutrient requirements. He only works out 4  hours per week.
Who will achieve their goals faster? The second boy will. He will make more gains because he puts all his effort in the 20% of things that will result in 80% of the results. Instead of spending 12 hours in the gym like his friend, he stimulates his body effectively and gives it plenty of rest resulting in insane gains. 




##**Work:**

Jim works in a sales department. He spends most of his days performing small tasks that are delegated to him. he replies to every email and is quick to give anyone his time. Unfortunately, due to the workload, Jim only spends one hour of his day performing cold calls. He has been working hard for a couple of years doing everything his boss command, however, has been unable to create the results needed to be eligible for a promotion.

Ray works in the same sales department as Jim. He spends most of his time at work cold calling clients. He doesn’t reply to most of his email. When he uses email it’s only to deal with potential clients or critical tasks. Ray does not have time to chit-chat with co-workers. To him, if something is a non-critical task it can be delegated to someone else. Through his time spent on client acquisition, he has managed to secure 6 figure deals, making his boss very happy. Ray doesn’t complete half of the tasks in his job description but gets promotions regardless.

Ray is successful because of his understanding of the 80/20 rule. Jim is not successful because he treats all tasks with equal weighting.

##**Relationships:**

You are divorced from your wife and can only spend one day out of the week with you Son, what do you do? Is it better to watch TV with him for a couple of hours or to go outside and do something? Think about this, we forget probably around 99% of our lives. The day to day shenanigans quickly disappears into the ether. Don’t believe me? Can you remember what you did throughout one whole day a month ago? No, we only remember things of significance such going away on that trip, or your sister’s wedding. Now back to your son, if your goal is to optimize your relationship with him, you are probably better off going fishing with him or shooting a few hops at the park. These things are will be the 20% that equals 80% of the memories he remembers with you. 

##**Education:**

I remember having a project management class for my engineering degree. Our assignment was to do a presentation in front of the whole class. A couple of my friends spent weeks and hours researching for the assignment. Come due day, all they presented was a dense and boring death by powerpoint slide. 

I was to present the week after, I decided to take a different approach and look at the criteria of the assignment. I noticed that presentation skills such as eye contact, and vocal tonality scored high. I also remembered the professor telling us that our slides should be simple. So, my team and I decided to focus on simple and entertaining slides that got to the point quicker. We didn’t use palm cards and remembered our speeches making them far more engaging. A total of 8 hours was spent on the presentation and we received the highest mark in the class.  


**80/20 everything**

To maximize your efficiency in life you must always be looking for the 20% that will give you 80% of the results. When you find these double down on them, make them your primary focus. As Tim Ferriss suggests, always ask yourself

*‘what is the one thing that I can do that will make everything else irrelevant’,*
It might be cold calling new customers
It might be eliminating soda drinks from your diet. 
Make it your mission in life to always look for these 20%, those motherfuckers are the true game changers.

The fellows in the comments gave me enough mistrust to decide that perhaps I should check her messages right when she left the room (something I wouldn't normally do, because I trusted her), but almost like clockwork, I found a group message with her and her friends, with her talking about how she wants to fuck this guy in her study group, a guy that was previously flirting with her over text and when I confronted her about it before, she claimed that she didn't think it was flirting and that she could handle herself.

In any case, right when she came back in the room I confronted her about it and she tried to rationalize it in some absurd ways, but needless to say I said ""we're done"" and walked out right there. She's been trying to call me and knock on my door and shit, but I'm just keeping up no contact.

We've been together for 3 years so it's somewhat solemn that she's just another woman when I took her for a unicorn for so long. In any case, I got a haircut and some new clothes earlier and plan on going out to get some new pussy tonight for the first time in 3 years.

All I can say is, thank you Redpill. Thank you so much. ",2017-03-30 05:29:31
28,You Got a Stranger Pregnant: A Guide.,1794,0,1794,3vri4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3vri4k/you_got_a_stranger_pregnant_a_guide/,479,1449500819.0,"**Summary:** There is not a lot of advice out there if you get a stranger pregnant other than, ""Get ready to get fucked for 18 years with child support.""  I slipped up once and had sex with a girl I had met one time previous.  13 days later she called me and told me she was pregnant. This is a simple story of what I did next.  What's the next best thing you can do?  (Italics are chapters from 48 Laws of Power).  The laws in your state vary; so what happens in Indiana may not work in your state.
*****
**The First Conversation**
My daughter's mom called me early in the morning to tell me she was pregnant.  She asked me what she should do.  This question is testing you in a lot of different ways.  Are you going to freak out?  Are you going to try to convince her to get an abortion?  The correct answer is to say, in a calm and confident manner, for her to start taking prenatal vitamins.  If you want an abortion you have weeks to talk about it.  This is an easy question to knock out of the park.  If she decides to have a child she can NEVER use against you that you wanted an abortion.  When shit goes downhill she will throw you under the bus to everyone she knows.  Give her as little ammunition as possible.  Reason: You will need to maintain frame in a way that you've never had to for a length of time that seems impossible.  When you know what she's saying is not true it makes it easier to suffer the slings and arrows. In my case I could tell immediately that abortion was not a live option and that I would be left in the dark for the next 9 months if I brought it up.  But I should add that I would never abort a child as a form of birth control

**Week 1** - Start saving 20% of your income for a safe new car.  Well, that's what I told by daughter's mom.  I told everyone that actually.  It would have been great, but I knew then that it was unlikely.  Really what I was doing is saving 20% of my income to see what child support was going to be like AND for attorney fee's.  I spent every dime so far.  Start saving immediately.  Hope for the best, plan for the worst.

**On Child Support** - That money is simply no longer yours.  Do not argue about it or whine or try to get out of it.  She might even tell you she doesn't want it.  Do not take the bait.  Force her hand.  Require her to take the money.  There are other methods to avoid paying your full legal obligation.  But you MUST *play the perfect courtier* from the very beginning.  Your end goal is to have a congruent story. If you want to argue philosophically about how it's immoral or whatever post on this site.  In America It's like arguing with gravity.  It makes you look like a fucking moron.  My strategy was to just immediately give her the ground.  No need for her to fight it.  Why?  *Assume Formlessness.*   In the future she will try to hurt you.  She will have learned a lot about what hurts you.  You will never be hurt the way a pregnant woman can hurt you.  She has so much power over you (due to the laws in this country) that you will break.   A year later she is still using what she knows hurts me to try to hurt me now.   Fortunately I *Controlled the Options.*

**Week 2** Tell her that you're getting a paternity test through the courts.  Not a walgreen's kit.  She will understandably be outraged at the implication.  Tell her early before you guys get to know each other and just say casually that you two are strangers.  Ask her if she trust you 100% already.  Tell her it's a legal requirement for setting up child support (half true).  When I did this, it really wasn't that big of a deal.  

**Week 3-5ish** *Plan all the way to the end* and *Know who you are dealing with*  Pregnancy amplifies whatever is wrong with a girl.  Obviously she is not a princess if she hooked up with a stranger. It should put a huge spotlights on her specific brand of crazy.  Between September and October I knew her fairly well.  I knew she wanted to be a ""heroic single mom.""  I knew she had an avoidant attachment style.  She was an insane control freak.  She gave me faux options to manipulate me into thinking I had a choice in the matter.  She told me before we knew the gender that my child would not have my last name and that there was nothing I could do about it.  The anguish and pain that caused me could not be hidden.  I told her that we were not in agreement on this issue but she told me that I would have to deal with it and tough shit.  My brain said she was right, there was nothing I could do because I was powerless. *Use the Surrender Tactic: Transform Weakness into Power* and than later *Play a Sucker to Catch a Sucker – Seem Dumber than your Mark*  In any dispute where you have no power you shouldn't argue with her, just state that you are not in agreement on this issue and drop it.  You will pay an attorney to argue with her in the future.  

**6 months of hell** I went to every doctor's appointment she invited me to.  I did everything she wanted including signing a lease with her.  It was her idea, but I saw how I could use it to my advantage. I think at this point she was trying to get me to say no to something so she could go tell everyone want a terrible dude I was.  But my rationale was this: Best case scenario when she moves out after a year I could argue that child lives at that house and is off breast milk, emergency placement prior to court is usually the residence that the child knows best.  Worst case scenario - I had signed a lease with a girl I wasn't even dating, that's how invested in my child's life I was.  Make sure you can afford to pay for the entire rent yourself before signing the lease. MAKE SURE SHE SIGNS THE LEASE.  My daughter's mom tried to get out of signing it.  Nope, her name is on that shit.  Which will prevent her from claiming you raped her.... but who would do that.


**Last three months**- Mom moved out due to me being a manipulative, uncaring, slob (her words).  We had one fight while living together and nothing she said was true.  She was just looking for a reason to move out.  She refused to talk to me for the last three months of the pregnancy.  I really think her issue is that she knew she wasn't controlling me.  We didn't talk for three months.  

In those three months I focused on *Concentrating my Forces*.  I had told my daughter's mom that my parents were moving here to help us out. This has helped me so much in my fight to get visitation so far. My sister lives in town, my brother lives in town, and now both my parents were available at all times to baby sit.  I also went lawyer shopping over the three month period.  www.avvo.com   I talked to five different lawyers. 

**I make this sound easy:** I haven't mentioned about how my health declined due to stress.  It was the worst when I signed the lease with her.  Huge gamble unknown whether it was foolish or if it would pay off.  My vision started changing every single day (Eye doctor tried saying I had type II diabetes), Bald spots appeared in my beard, blood pressure went into type II hypertension.  I spent more on doctor bills in six months than my entire adult life.  Hang in there man.  Find a support group, coworkers, family members.  Lean on people but remember that they want to see a success story.  Females at work always love to hear about a father fighting to stay in their childrens' lives.

**You have no rights** Before the paternity test you have no rights.  Zero.  You must continue to use the surrender tactic.  You are literally a random stranger to that kid.  Do not sign a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity.  If you have a good lawyer he delivered the court order BEFORE your child was born to do a paternity test.  I was the father by the way.

**Mom Fights Back**  Oh man she will fight as if her life depends on it.  Her maternal instinct to protect that child from people she doesn't trust/like is going to make her behave like a crazy person. She tried to fight the paternity test.  She didn't let me see my daughter for three weeks over father's day and then acted like it was my own fault.  Bite your tounge.  You still have a ways to go. Do NOT fight with the mom.  Ever.  You arguing with Mom is a waste of breath.  You pay an attorney to fight her.  *Win through your Actions, Never through Argument*  No matter what she did to me I didn't let it phase me.  I made sure the courts knew what she did so that we could have a congruent case of her denying me visitations.  The day I was declared the father through the paternity test Mom filed serious endangerment charges against me.  At first she was alleging that I raped her.  But that lease she signed with me destroyed that option.  My attorney BCCed me on emails so I basically read his response as, ""are you joking?  This is a joke.  She signed a lease with him.""  So she went with a whole shit ton of mud instead.  None of it true.  The courts MUST investigate so don't take it personally ($$$ $$ because of the Children $$$$).  Play the perfect courtier.  Remember you don't care about money, only about bonding with your child.     My Attorney was 1500, the supervised visits cost me 1200$, the guardiam ad litem cost me 1400$.  I never brought up that she filed this, never yelled at her for it.  Just imagine you're playing chess.  She made a move, it's your job to anticipate it and counter it.  It's easy to counter.   

**Guardiam Ad Litem** She is the only person you care to win over.  Play the perfect courtier.  Play the perfect courtier.  Play the perfect courtier.  The GAL relies on the supervisor that is watching you with your daughter.  Treat the supervisor like an old friend.  Listen to their stories of other ""crazy"" parents.  Mom won't like the supervisor because she's not in control, someone else is in control. To the GAL, compliment Mom on her mothering abilities.  Never trash talk her, don't ever say anything emotionally charged about her.  Say you're only complaint is that she won't let you or your family see your daughter.  Say you just want to be equals as parents.    I remember distinctly saying, ""four hours a week is just not enough, it's just not enough""  to which she echo'd me.  Mine had a questionnaire for me to fill out and I spent 8 hours writing and rewriting it until it was the perfect.  I had painted a picture, that was true, whereby Mom has mud on her by the end and yet you never saw me throw anything and my hands remained clean.  

By the next court date I had the Guadian Ad Litem telling me she was going to try to get me 50/50 joint custody.  It helped me out a lot that I actually liked both the supervisor handling my case and the GAL. I knew immediately they would be able to see through Mom's ridiculous behavior if I just continued to maintain frame and play the perfect courtier. I could tell they were both good people.  Your mileage may vary and you will get GAL who are in it for the money.  My attorney went out of his way to get this GAL.  I didn't do this at the time but absolutely research reviews online for the GAL.  The GAL is actually more important than the attorney you get.  Tell your attorney that you want a GAL who has a reputation for acting in the child's best interest.  The supervisor handling my case also if you talk to her will gossip about the reputations of all the attorneys involved in your case.

**False Allegations** First the serious endangerment charges, next Mom will record every way that you're not doing a good job as a parent (in her mind).  Yes it annoys you to have to answer to everything you do with your time but it's annoying the Guardian ad litem too.  My favorite thing to say to the GAL is this, ""She has never brought it up to me, if I'm doing something wrong I want to know.  Why wouldn't she tell me?""  Play the perfect courtier.  When I won my first major battle I got the best false allegation of the year.  Mom came over and tried to start a fight with me.  She had nothing to go on and I have now never argued with her for 15 months.  Why would I start now?  Long story short she went postal while I remained calm.  She started hitting my door, etc.  She left and called the police.  Police showed up to ask me some questions.  The moment you prepare for finally happens (you are prepared for the police getting called on you when you start winning in court right?).  I simply tell him I don't answer questions without an attorney.  Bye bye sir. That was now 7 days ago and I've heard nothing from the police.  This is where maintaining frame comes into play.  It's so important, remember you're doing it for your child.  

**Assume Formlessness/Control the Options** Mom wants to hurt me.  But she never correctly figured out how.  She thought the only option for hurting me was to deny me visitations but that's because I controlled her options.  I put her in a position where her choices were to not attack me and let me visit my daughter and thus I win, or to attack me and (when I'm exonerated) it makes her look bad and thus I win.  She had a lot of options to waste my money and give me tons of time with my daughter (when I was paying someone to supervise me).  This would have made her look good and done a great deal of damage to me.  She never did it because she didn't realize it would hurt me.  From the beginning I acted like money was not a big deal and would constantly just spend it in front of her like I had an endless supply of it.  I would tell stories that carried the message that IDGAF about money.

**Present day** By this point no one in court believes her anymore.  I went into court thinking that she was going to get to file an order of protection but I think that even her own attorney must have advised against it.  I had my first overnight with my daughter.  This week.  I'm confident that she tarnished her reputation and they see that she's just hyper controlling and will fabricate things about me to maintain that control.  She doesn't know how to hurt me or control me (well controlling me would be easy, she just could try being nice to me). The best part is that soon I will have 50/50 custody which reduces my child support obligation (that thing I supposedly don't care about).  My attorney says that he has gotten surname changed and that there is a good likelihood (depending on the judge) that this also will come about.
*****
Guys you can win in court.  It's hard and unfair and we're not used to being discriminated against so obnoxiously.  We're not used to being guilty until proven innocent.  I constantly let Mom think she's smarter than me.  I play dumb constantly with her.  I never engage her.  I pretend like I don't know what's going on and that my attorney doesn't communicate with me very well.  I pretend like it's no big deal that she says crazy stuff about me.  I never ever ever ever gloat or rub it in or try to hurt her back.  She's a child, you're an adult.  If she knows what's going on in your brain the fight will never end.  Moves and countermoves guys.  It can be done.  It will affect your health.  I jumped out of an airplane and was so depressed I felt absolutely nothing.  There were days I woke up where I did not think I could do it; I didn't think I had the stamina for this type of warfare.  The toxicity from Mom was that intense.  The odds seemed to be stacked against me to too great of a degree.  You can do it if you must.  

*Edit:*  By the way, I forgot to mention this in the beginning but I really always ""hoped for the best, plan for the worst""  That was my strategy.  If you read through all of this you'll really see that it's obvious.  I genuinely hoped that Mom would figure out that I have my family in my best interest and that she could trust me.  Every step of the way I gave her the option of doing the right thing with no repercussion.  She just never took that option; I don't harp on it as it's probably never going to be relevant.  But as you try to win the hearts and minds of others make sure that you emphasize how you hope for the best and what you're doing (saving for a safe car, signing a lease with a stranger to raise your child together, going to all doctors appointments, etc.)  

*2nd Edit:* I should also mention this guide pertains to a non-substance abusing mother.  This is about getting your rights from a mom with no real issues.  I am so fortunate and happy that I don't have to worry about any actual harm going to my daughter.  Like if you remind yourself how much worse things could be, it makes it easier to remain stoic in the face of America's court system.

*3rd Edit:* Some typos's etc.  I have a paternity test guys.  It's in the story. Yes, I'm intelligent.  I am the type of guy that would never make a mistake.  I was drunk and I honestly just fucked up.  If it happened to me, it'll probably happen to other guys out there so I wrote this guide.  If you don't want to be a part of your child's life than you don't really need a guide.  Personally I couldn't leave my daughter to be raised without a father knowing everything I know about TRP. 
*****
**No. Thank You TRP** A lot of you guys are thanking me for writing this.  I'd like to say instead thanks to all of you.  The only, ONLY, reason I was prepared for all the false allegations, the toxicity, the back stabbery, the nonsense, the insanity, and the court system was you all and this community.  Very few guys naturally would ever think the way I was forced to think.  I was never flatfooted on ANYTHING she did because I was able to anticipate it months in advance (false rape allegations, domestic disputes with the police, etc) and thanks to you guys I knew how important maintaining frame was throughout all of this.  So while many of you don't agree with everything I did or get focused on the one time in my life I had unprotected sex (with a stranger), I don't mind the criticism because I never said that this guide was the ONE way to do it.  There is probably a better strategy.  I did waste a lot of energy on things that were absolute wastes of time. I'll try to write updates in the future to talk about what happens with Mom through the years.",2015-12-07 15:06:59

An army colonel was about to be promoted to general when some random blogger accused him of raping her like 30 fucking years ago. The army yanked his promotion and started an investigated that found no proof, but his career was over. Can you imagine that shit?

He sued her for defamation and was awarded $3.4 million for lost wages and reputation damage and $5 million (!!!!) for punitive damages. Apparently the punitive damages in this state are limited to $350K and the overall damages will probably be reduced to around $2 million, but wow this is still a huge win.

He proved that every part of her story literally could not have happened. The jury was composed of three men and four women. They deliberated for 2.5 hours, but the entire deliberation was over the amount of the damages. They all unanimously agreed after their initial poll that she was liable. One juror said that they awarded the punitive damages ""to make sure that something like this could never happen again.""

Edit: Oh and after the army's investigation found no evidence against him, his name was put forward again for promotion but Obama's scumbag Army Secretary still denied it. Unreal what that man did to the country.

Edit 2: Been getting some flak for my first edit because I said that Obama's Army Secretary denied the promotion and it is against sub rules to discuss politics. Sorry.... I guess? I didn't attack liberal tax policy or foreign policy. I attacked their sexual assault policy.

I'm not sure how the politics can really be disentangled from this case. One party has been driving this almost exclusively, and one party decided to create a situation in academia and in the military where one unfounded accusation on someone's blog ends your career/education in order to win more votes from women. That's the reality. If reality makes you uncomfortable, there are a few other subs I can recommend for you to check out such as Two X Chromosomes or The Blue Pill.

If any of the mods think this breaks the rules I will remove the offending paragraph.

Edit 3: There's a bit of confusion in the comments that people are saying ""glad he was acquitted,"" or ""why wasn't she jailed for lying,"" etc. I'd like to give a 10 cent civics lesson for those who maybe aren't from the US or don't fully understand the legal system. I'm not a lawyer. Please feel free to correct me if you are and I've made a mistake.

In the US and other countries that get their legal traditions from the English, there are two types of trials, criminal and civil. In a criminal trial, the people through their government bring charges against a person for breaking a law. At the trial the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you committed the crime to the jury. If the jury returns a guilty verdict, then you are punished by the state with fines, community service, probation, prison, or even death.

In a civil trial, one private citizen or corporation sues another private citizen or corporation (government can sometimes be sued but not always) for committing a tort against them. They seek to recover monetary damages for being wronged. These torts could be anything from libel/slander like in this case, to medical malpractice, to suing a dog owner if his animal bit you. In a civil trial, the person bringing the suit must show that there is a greater than 50% chance that they are correct (different standard than criminal trial) and also show how they were damaged by the wrongdoing.

If the jury decides in their favor they can then decide how much the damages should be. There are different types of damages that can be awarded. For example in this case the jury awarded him $3.4 million for lost wages and for damage to his reputation. This means that the jury believed that the wages he should have made as a general plus the damage to his future earning potential and the personal suffering he endured because of his damaged reputation was worth $3.4 million. They also awarded punitive damages of $5 million. Punitive damages are meant to punish the defendant and deter future behavior like this. Again note that the actual judgement was almost certainly reduced by the judge to around $2 million. This seems to be a pretty common theme in civil trials.

Some are asking why she is not in prison for making a false charge. She never made any official charge against him. She just put some words on her blog. Some are also asking why she isn't in jail for perjury (lying under oath), since she lost her case. Understand that just because she lost this case, she is not guilty of perjury. The government would have to bring charges against her and conduct a whole new criminal trial to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she lied in her testimony. Simply losing a court case in which you testified is not enough to convict you of perjury, otherwise the loser would be getting hit with a perjury charge after after case.

31,I was asked to train a new female employee to do the promotion I got passed on.,1764,0,1764,36q8dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/36q8dv/i_was_asked_to_train_a_new_female_employee_to_do/,462,1432220056.0,"I want to start this out by saying that the female coworker I trained wasn't coasting and she really wanted to learn how to do the job, but most importantly do it right.  I had been working for this outfit for about 2 years, and every foreman I had worked with had giving me great reviews.  A position opened up which was basically the same thing I had been doing, but instead of residential work, it would be more on the commercial side.  This new title came with a substantial pay raise and I made it very clear to my bosses that I wanted the job.  A week or so went by and they had me take written tests to see how well I knew everything incumbent to the job, I passed every single test without getting  single answer wrong.  This job was mine.  I busted my ass.  Then I get the word that they hired someone to fill the position.  I was bummed out to say the least, but to make it worse it was someone with no prior experience and I had to train them on how to do the job.  This person happened to be female and day one during training was getting paid almost twice as much as myself.  I didn't take it lightly and requested a meeting with my superiors.  They told me that it was because a quota for minorities had to be filled (even though the person who left and created the vacancy was a white male) and that I should just keep doing what I have been doing and it will all work out for me.  I walked out of that office, thought about it for a minute, walked back in and quit.  I got the job I was looking for at a competing company with in a week.  Like I said I have nothing against the person who got the job, she was eager to learn and do it the right way, but that doesn't mean I had to take it sitting down.

4. Don't deal with a shitty women. Ever.

5. Don't be ashamed of your sexual desires or think that girls don't want sex and have to be 'convinced' into having sex with you. When it comes to sex, men are like an on-off switch, women are like a volume knob.

25. They have their mobile phones near them at ALL times, and i mean ALL, no matter what they are doing (or what is being done to them). if they want to contact you immediately, they can and will. so if you message them and they do not text you back until a few days later, they are deliberately ignoring your ass.

26. It doesn't matter how long you've been with a woman, how many memories you have together, or how much effort you've put in...she will forget you in less than a week and move onto the next guy.

27. Women want someone to take care of them but they want to feel like they are taking care of themselves

28. Dont stick your dick in crazy (trust me) and wrap your shit

29. What women truly want is value. They want a combination of things that excite their dopamine receptors, none of which come directly from you loving her. She wants your value; your status, your wealth, your protection, and your comfort.

As incredible as posts and the comments section can be, they can't replace the visual aspect and thoroughness of a clip. Below, are videos that **every** TRP member, newbie and veteran alike, is required to watch, except below the weightlifting section. Many of them have been sporadically shared here in this sub over the years, but now they're in one place. None of them are a substitution for the other. Videos have been backed up in case of censorship. **Beware**: intellectual burnout and anger phase relapse may occur. There's a comedy section at the end, I suggest you periodically dip in it for some relief, it can get depressing. A good laugh will be had. **Enjoy**.

**[Do Women Earn Less?]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwogDPh-Sow)**

 >""Like other myths, this does have a kernel of truth to it. So for example, if you add up all the incomes of women and divide by the number of women in the labor force and then do the same thing for men, what you'll find is, on average, women do make about 75% of what men do. **What's happening is not discrimination in the labor market, but differences in the choices that men and women make (about investing in their knowledge, their education, their skills, and their job experiences) that led to them getting paid different salaries.**""

**Indoctrination and Consumerism**
------------------

**[Century of the Self (4 Part Series)](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article12642.htm)**

Like Darwin and his theory of evolution, Sigmund Freud's ideas about the subconscious controlling most of our lives was considered, 'radical', specifically those pertaining to sexuality. It was insulting to people's sensibilities and egos that they weren't in complete conscious control of their lives. And also like Darwin's critics, people didn't like being reminded that they were animals underneath it all.

-

**[SJW's are Useful Idiots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLqHv0xgOlc)**

Here he was, at the gym, which is an inherently not bitchy place even if sometimes some retardedly hot piece and her friend start babbling. And, yet, this man was a bitch all the same. He cowered at the sight of masculine men, and women, well, they may as well have been Medusa for how much he avoided looking at them. This couldn't do at all!

My dear boy, I said to him. I am going to help. I am the Ghost of Getting Ass, and I have taken pity on you! Come! We must debitchify you!

The man seemed uncertain as to whether or not he should get onto the motorcycle, so, to aid him, I punched him in the face.

What did you do that for, the man said.

I wagged an alpha finger at him.

 > Don't be uncertain! Uncertainty is the move of women and bitch men. Asses your options, and then do what springs to mind immediately.


The man struggled to get a proper foothold on the bike, and he immediately crashed into a light post.

Don't you know how to ride a bike?

The man shook his head pathetically. I gave him my hand and put him back on the bike, teaching him how.

> Learn Skills and do exciting things! Women are attracted to skill and being good at something exciting and dangerous gets women wetter than ten thousand roses ever could. Women are extremely boring, and you are the exciting instrument that they secretly want to blow.

The man and I rode our motorcycles to some dive bar and began to drink with the other men. The man, now surrounded by pure uncut masculinity, began to loosen up.

She has titties as big as satellite dishes! One man said. And the bar laughed. I turned to the man again.

> Become immersed in masculinity. Once you are surrounded by something you become more comfortable. Like diving into a pool. Once the waters of masculinity become a Haven for you, your adventures with women will become easier.

The man and I left the bar. Time to score some ass!

I saw some Latina bitch with a fine ass walking by and went over and alphaed her until her panties got wet, of course. The man stood behind me, looking at women. He was strutting his chest out and holding his head high.

I stopped talking to the Latina.

What the fuck are you doing, faggot?

I'm being alpha, the man replied, I read a post about alpha body language and i-

I punched his flabby jaw.

Stop it. 

> You can act as alpha as you want, but beautiful women need to be approached. They have incredibly low self-esteem and are insecure. They could not handle it if you rejected them. And so they don't apporach. They are a lot like most of you, a bitch, afraid of even the slightest bit of bumps in the road.

The man finnaly grew a big set of balls, and went up and talked to a woman. 

H-hi...

Dear God what is he doing, but then I remembered patience. Not so long ago I was a beta faggot who wouldn't know what to do with a pussy if it was gift wrapped and sent to my door.

I-i thought you were cute and I wanted to say hi.

I have a boyfriend, the bitch replies.

Oh, I'm sorry, ok bye.


The man walks away.

I grab him by the arm.
Hey, that was pretty shite but at least now you know one thing.

> Rejection is better than regret.


The night is over, and the man goes to his 9-5. I follow along, floating beside him like the alpha Spectre that I am. He slacks off at his job, and constantly shoots glances at Karen, the funky bitch with the back tattoo in HR. As he goes to the urinal for his procrastination piss, I give him a solid jab to the ear.

Hey retard.

> Money is more important than women. Start paying more attention to your bank account and less towards whores.


The man is done and drives home, listening to some classic rock garbage that every department store plays to brainwash you into buying heaters. 

Are you going to the gym now, you haven't gone today, I say to him.

He shakes his head.

I, uh, went yesterday and besides I think I'm gonna switch to calisthenics, it's a more- 

I spit in his eye


> The gym is your church, and if you are a good Christian man you don't just go on Sundays. You go to every pot luck, every meeting, and keep your body strong.

After lifting weights, the man begins to play videogames with his online friends. After about an hour I relieve myself on his XBONE or whatever the fuck.

Hey what the hell man, he shouts. Dont piss on my stuff!

I piss on his shoes now.


Listen faggot!

> Video games aren't a skill and if you play it for longer than an hour you are atrophying away. Their is a world full of fresh pussy waiting to be dined upon, and we, the last alphas in this bluepill dystopia, must endeavor to dine on it.


The man now sits mindlessly on his phone.

Don't you have any hobbies, I ask. 

The man says yes, but upon closer inspection it appears his hobby is smoking weed and jacking off.

I look over to his closet.

Boxing gloves, a parachute, dancing shoes, a fencing sword or whatever the fuck it's called.

I then realize his problem.


> Find hobbies and stick to them. Nothing ever comes easy at first, but you risk becoming a boring and retarded loser if you don't do anything.

The man is now finally looking good and approaches a woman the right way for the first time.

I don't usally do this she says

I don't believe he responds suavely.

I'd tell you how to approach a woman the right way, but their are over 100 posts about it. Here's what you should remember.

> Take risks with women, as my uncle Vasily says, faint heart never fucked fair lady.

Finally, the man is back at his room with a woman. As he fucks, I hover over him giving him the thumbs up ocassionly. Felt like highschool running trains again.

A final rule.

> Betas fuck like in movies. If ur alpha u go for the kidneys with every pump, grabbing a handful of neck while you do so.


The man nuts all over the girls face.

He turns to me.

But Visible, I feel so empty. Did I do all this work for this momentary satisfaction.

No. Go look in the mirror.


And their, he sees himself, a healthy, strong, masculine man, who is happy with his life.

And finally he understands.

> The Redpill isn't about women, it's about you. And making you a better version if yourself. Women are a secondary thing. You, are what is important. And as you improve, you shall become happier.

These threads get seized upon by our detractors, who eagerly point out: “See? See!? The Red Pill doesn’t ‘work’ ! It just ends relationships and turns guys into assholes!”

Independent of what is and is not actually “Red Pill behavior,” situations like these are based a bad assumption. Simply put, in examples like this, the lamenting woman has presupposed that prior to her man’s “changes”, their relationship was actually good, and he was actually happy. Then he ruined everything by reading some bullshit online that told him how his relationship ought to be, then trying to implement it.

This begs the question: If the relationship was fine before the boyfriend went all Red Pill on his woman, why is he trying to change things? Why did he go on the internet and seek out the manosphere? If he’s happy with his relationship the way it is, why is he trying to find ways to improve his sex life and become more assertive?  (All of this, of course, assumes that a) the stories presented on Reddit are true; and b) the man actually sought out The Red Pill and didn’t just stop kissing his girlfriend’s ass for any number of other reasons.)

The Red Pill is here because men aren’t happy. They don’t want to be sweet and sensitive and do things for women all day long and be the “perfect boyfriend,” while having subpar sex once every six weeks, paying out the ass for expensive dates and gifts, sacrificing personal time, and getting bitched at and threatened with a break-up if any of this perfect behavior ever dips slightly. They don’t want to give backrubs and footrubs, stay at home one weekend a month while their women have a night out with the girls, get disrespected and talked about behind their backs, get cheated on (but just harmless, meaningless mistakes that don’t really count!), and get berated when they push back against any of this. They don’t want to let women move in, rent-free, and get pressured to buy a ring for a four-digit number of dollars and tie their finances to someone who makes less than half as much money, just because they’ve been “dating awhile” and “it’s time” and they’re “supposed to.”

Sure, everything’s hunky-dory for these girlfriends, but for the men, everything is NOT happy. Everything is NOT going well. And men are sick of it.

When a 28-year-old man with an entitled bitch of a girlfriend of 5 years stumbles across the Red Pill, he reads stories about men not so much older than he is who don’t have or want girlfriends. They don’t need a girlfriend because they have four or five women fucking their brains out on a regular basis outside of a relationship. They barely spend a cent on dates or activities. They barely lift a finger to impress women. But girls can’t seem to get enough of them.

And what these men do seems so simple. Work out, focus on your career, practice your social skills and get confident, develop useful skills and interesting hobbies – essentially, quit wasting time. Read non-fiction instead of fiction, watch less TV, play less video games, quit jerking off to porn, spend that time doing something that makes you physically, mentally, or socially better. The Red Pill tells men that their time is valuable, and to use it well. Hand in hand with that, The Red Pill tells men that since their time is their most valuable resource, quit wasting it on women when you’re not getting something of equal value in return. If your girlfriend is ugly, sexually ungenerous, lazy, or just an entitled bitch that expects you to do all kinds of crap for her just to maintain the pleasure of having a girlfriend, is it really worth all of the time and energy you expend? When you could be doing something that actually improves your life?

The Red Pill exists because many men aren’t happy. Because these relationships that are allegedly “just fine” are very much NOT just fine. Because men are giving so much to their women and getting so little, with the assumption that merely existing – merely being a presence in the man’s life – is all a woman needs to do to become his highest priority. That men should be falling over themselves getting in line for the right to say “I have a girlfriend,” and nothing more. Men are sick of this.

Guys in the “my man went Red Pill and ruined our relationship” Reddit posts probably aren’t actually going to internet sites to get an instruction manual for how to piss off their girlfriends. They’re just normal guys who know in the pit of their stomach that something is wrong – that they’re wasting their lives, and that they’re not happy. It’s not their girlfriends’ fault, it’s theirs. And they decide one day, for whatever reason, to try to take control of their lives, of their relationships, and build something they’re actually proud of. And steps 1 and 2 of that process involve asserting yourself and living the way you want, and expecting the people with whom you associate (e.g., your woman) to add value to your life equal to the value you’re expending. The rest of the world shorthands that behavior as “being an asshole,” and “ruining relationships.” How sad is that? Honestly and confidently pursuing the life you want, and expecting others to hold up their end of a relationship is the new Hitler.",2014-06-05 23:28:24
36,There is a big difference between knowledge and wisdom.If you want to learn things fast as fuck and actually understand what you are learning I suggest ‘The Feynman Technique’. It was popularized by Richard Feynman a Noble Award-winning Quantum Physicist. Here is a quick guide.,1727,0,1727,7t9ocm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7t9ocm/there_is_a_big_difference_between_knowledge_and/,106,1517048724.0,"##**The Feynman Technique**

The Feynman Technique is a method of learning that is incredibly effective for deep understanding and information retention. How many time have you learned something fast only to forget how to do it weeks later? Maybe it was the Pythagoras theorem, back in high school when you crammed for your math exam. Now when you friend asks you to recite it, all you can do is shrug and say 

***“What the fuck is that? A Harry Potter spell?”***

The problem was that you never learned the thing properly, you simply stored it in the temporary storage section of your brain. This is how many people go about learning, reciting things only to forget them later. 
There is a big difference between knowledge and wisdom, knowledge is having the information, wisdom is knowing how to use it. 

The Feynman Technique is a mental model that will help you gain sufficient wisdom in any endeavour. 
Richard Feynman was a Noble Prize-winning theoretical physicist who was best known for his work in the fields of quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, superfluidity and other groovy shit. To say the least his was a smart dude, he was often called the ‘Great Explainer’ for his uncanny ability to teach complicated principles in layman terms that everybody could understand. 
  Feynman claims that he wasn’t a naturally gifted physicist but managed to make it due to his learning style and hard work. Here is his notorious method for accelerated understanding. 

##**Step One:**

Write the name of a concept that you want to learn about on top of a blank piece of paper. 

##**Step Two:**

Write down an explanation of the concept using plain English. Pretend that you trying to teach it to the slowest person you know or a child. Assume the person has no idea what the hell you are talking about so make sure you cover everything you know simply. 

##**Step Three:**
 
Read over your explanation and take note of the areas in which you are lacking the sufficient knowledge in order to articulate yourself properly. Take note of these areas and return to your source material until you have a better understanding Use a variety of materials: YouTube videos, books, and experts. Return to step two and simplify further.

**Note: When you simply you are cutting out the slack, do not remove things that are important for understanding whatever you trying to learn. You are simply trying to be more concise.**

##**Step Four:**

Use the aid of simple analogies, diagrams, metaphors and anything else that can help you commit what you have learned to memory. Come at it from different angles to gain a deeper understanding of the topics.
Einstein is often attributed to saying:

***“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough”***

The Feynman Technique will ensure that you understand any subject incredibly well. 

##**What Can You Learn Using The Method?**

To put it simply you can learn anything with the method from:

* Computer Programming 
* Calculus 
* Physics
* Economics 
* Chemistry 
* Mathematics

Anything at all! You might have to modify the method slightly for some disciplines but the main underlying principle is what makes the method so effective. 


##**WHY IT WORKS:**

The Feynman Technique works for many reasons. Often when we are trying to learn new concepts we erroneously assume that we have learned them and understood them when in actuality we haven’t fully grasped the concepts. 

Feynman once said:

***“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”***

This is the first and most critical mistake that many make when trying to learn new things. Writing what you know and trying to simplify it exposes your gaps in understanding. 

The second reason it works is through the beauty of neural connections. Think back to 2 weeks ago when you went grocery shopping. Can you remember what you bought or what happened at the shops? Most likely not, your brain does not put much stock into the mundane. Now let’s assume 2 weeks ago you were shopping and you saw three firefighters running towards to deli section. Now that’s a memory you won’t forget, you might remember it for the rest of your life because it was out of the ordinary. 

The strongest neural connections are always formed with things that are out of the ordinary. This is why you can remember what you were doing when you heard about 9/11 or can vividly recall your first kiss.
Now when you are learning and are up to step 4. You are forced to come up with analogies and metaphors to help you understand concepts. This simple process is out of the ordinary and allows your brain to have more stimulus to work with, more checkpoints to return to when you trying to recall a piece of information. 
So that’s the Feynman Method, for overrun and an actual real-time example, make sure to check out my animated video here:

37,15 Things I've Learned Over the Last 53 Years,1724,0,1724,7che04,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7che04/15_things_ive_learned_over_the_last_53_years/,346,1510542846.0,"Meta Rule:  Be a narcissistic jerk -- or at least act like one -- even if it's not your nature.  This facilitates everything else.

1.  Take care of yourself first!!!  You cannot count on anyone -- especially any romantic interest -- to stick by you if you get sick or lose your job.  Therefore, do everything in your power to make sure you stay fit, healthy, and gainfully employed.

2.  Women rate 80% of guys as being below average aesthetically (OKC survey).  Therefore, do whatever it takes to get into and remain in the top 20%.  Exercise and diet are priorities.  If you have to ""cheat"" do so.  weight loss surgery, TRP, cosmetic surgery, do what you have to.

3.  Don't slack off even if you're in a LTR.  She'll expect you to ignore her physical decline but she sure as fuck won't ignore yours.  Going to the gym is actually more important for guys in LTRs -- they have more to lose.

4.  Don't play her game -- being a strong male is way more important than cheap romantic gestures.  She wants a strong Alpha not a fat sick Beta with roses.
 
5.  Do not invest in any relationship with a woman until she proves she's worthy.

6.  If she's externally motivated run!  If she's excessively concerned about what her friends, colleagues, and acquaintances think she's not relationship material.  This type of girl is expensive and never satisfied.
    
7.  It's a good thing for a woman to have goals.  However, talk is cheap, if a woman is all talk and hasn't actually executed she's not relationship material.  Getting what you want takes work and sacrifice.  If she has a history of not putting in the work and not enduring the requisite sacrifice to reach her stated goals she's not worth your time, effort, or investment.

8.  Stay away from damaged women.  If she's been abused and/or traumatized be empathetic but write her off as a serious prospect.  Cold for sure but very important for self-preservation.
 
9.  If her mother is an objectionable person run.  If her mother is a dishonest, grasping, materialistic objectionable person run faster.  We all know where this item is going.

10.  If she claims to be nothing like her mother look for proof that she is indeed different.  DON'T JUST TAKE HER WORD FOR IT!!!  The proof must encompass a very significant amount of time and must involve serious effort on her part.

11.  Stay away from women who claim they're ""not like those other bitches"".  She's most likely either lying or deluding herself.  If she has a history of being dishonest, greedy, and self centered she's just like those other bitches (if not worse).
 
12.  Stay away from women who are always making excuses.  Life requires effort to overcome obstacles.  If she has a history of being derailed by minor obstacles she's not relationship material.  This is especially true if she's otherwise smart and, therefore, could have, with a little effort, easily negotiated her way around or over life's little obstacles.  Examples; (a) gets taken to the cleaners at the used car dealership because she never had a father to teach her how to buy a car -- especially bad when she works just two blocks from a Barnes & Noble with many good books on how to buy a used car -- and let's not forget the internet; (b)  never finished college because her family wasn't supportive and didn't go back even though advancement in her chosen career absolutely requires a 4 year degree at the very least -- especially bad when the degree she needs can be obtained online through a number of reputable universities (good state schools).

13.  No agency or execution.  If she only takes advantage of opportunities that fall into her lap she's not relationship material.  Individuals need to act -- if you have a goal it's on you to take the action necessary to reach it.  If the only reason she got an AA is because her welfare social worker told her it was either that or get a minimum wage job run.  If she started a degree completion program through her employer but never followed up on her own when budget cuts terminated the program run.

14.  If she has a history of substance abuse run!  Even an eating disorder counts.  If she can't control what she puts into her body how can she be trusted with anything.

15.  If you want a Norman Rockwell life you have to choose a woman with deeply ingrained middle class values (i.e. internally motivated, strong work ethic, truly values honesty, willing to delay gratification ...).  If her ghetto or trailer park background is just below the surface she's not relationship material.   ",2017-11-13 03:14:06
38,The red pill are a bunch of bigots who can't get laid.,1719,0,1719,2zp8n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2zp8n4/the_red_pill_are_a_bunch_of_bigots_who_cant_get/,490,1426889499.0,"They're all virgin neckbeards. Couldn't get laid to save their lives.

I consider it somewhat ironic on a meta level, that the people saying this don't themselves see the irony. 

Recently we were deemed the most bigoted subreddit on this site. And of course the usual insults began to fly. We are, as everybody knows, just a bunch of sexless, angry, nobodies. 

I'm hoping I've caught the attention of at least a few new people taking a peek to see what we're about. You're probably hoping to find evidence to support the popular opinion- that we should be chided or ignored. 

The reason we are here and the reason we don't care about the insults are one in the same: Because joining the red pill did not *start* the insults, instead the insults started the red pill.

The irony sorely lost on the masses is in the call for equality, anti-bigotry, and whatever other causes your average social justice warrior stands up for. The public has doubled down and taken up the very weapons they decry. Shame and scorn against those they disagree with. *Sexual shame* in retribution for *valuing sex*. Smooth.

They say that we're wrong in our assessments, and then revoke our manhoods by commenting on our inability to get sex.

But they've got the order of operations down wrong. 

I'm not going to deny that we have had trouble with sex. That is the common thread that brings us here. Using sexlessness to dismiss us is precisely the behavior that brought men here to begin with. We *were* sexless. Our views and perspectives, our so-called ""bigotry"" did not lead us to a sexless life so you can conveniently dismiss our views. Instead, our sexless lives lead us to adopt these views as a last ditch effort to reach sexual success. And most of us stayed here when we realized it was effective.

**But life isn't all about sex! You guys are obsessed!**

Right? 

I think it's pretty safe to say that most women don't really understand to what degree sex matters in the average man's life. He finds more than a physical release, he finds belonging and acceptance in sex. Sex for a man is knowing you are wanted. The fact is, for most of our lives, we've come to accept that we are not sexually desirable to most (or all) women. Our advances left us crushed and depressed, were treated as creepy or worse than murder. Our relationships left us broken or broke. Our marriages crumbled. If you listen to pop culture, and believe everybody finds their special somebody, then we must have been the outcasts.

The fact that commenting on our lack of sexual success is inherent in all public dismissal of us (virgin neckbeards) should help put this into perspective- even the feminists and social justice warriors of the world denouncing sex as that important have made our manhoods (and therefore rights to have or speak an opinion at all) entirely dependent on our access to sex. Why would being a virgin or a neckbeard matter, unless sex *truly does matter to our manhoods?* 

I don't really buy the rationale that it does matter to be a man. But I do recognize that sex will still be important to men nevertheless. And so here I support such a hypothesis, and behold, 102,000 men in two years have flocked. You can dismiss us, our views, and theories. But you cannot dismiss the common need and problem that brought us together.

I want to back up a little bit, and address the idea that we're social outcasts. 

Now, you'd think, every gender and every group has their outcasts. Looking back at highschool, there were always those fringe groups that didn't quite get along. Some banded together in their unpopularity and played dungeons and dragons or wore funny looking clothing. So what's the red pill? Just a group of pimply-faced nerds who never learned to talk to women?

That's the problem here- the reason for our corner of the internet. It affects more than just the pimply-faced nerds, more than the short guys, more than the fat, the skinny, or the ugly. 

The changes to inter-gender relations over the past 30 years have started to affect *all of us*.

You can see it in the declining marriage rates, in the studies that show dissatisfaction among both genders in relationships, the sky-high divorce rates, and the endless stories of custody battles and alimony cases. The school shootings and the male suicide rate, the gamer scandals, and presidential campaigns. The declining rate of male college graduates and the women who don't care. The single mothers, and the children who hate men.

We're not the sexless virgins. We're not the neckbeards.

We're fathers, firefighters, pilots, drivers, teachers, engineers, students, bankers, and entrepreneurs who are tall, skinny, fit, fat, good-looking, ugly, old, young, happy, angry, sad, depressed,  and everything in between.

And we've all been affected by the changing environment. 

And none of us found compassion, belonging, or empathy in the very system that gave us this shared experience.

Maybe we are bigots, maybe we hate women. Maybe we aren't, and maybe we don't.  It's entirely superfluous to the point of why we're here. Attacking these points does not dismiss our existence, nor does it address it.

It's up to you how you're going to deal with this information. ",2015-03-20 22:11:39
39,"College student Nikki Yovino, 19, sentenced to 3 years for falsely claiming sexual encounter was rape",1707,0,1707,99zxpf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/99zxpf/college_student_nikki_yovino_19_sentenced_to_3/,233,1535164345.0,"In 2016, Nikki Yovino had consensual sex with two football players in a bathroom at a party.  The next day, she claimed she was raped, allegedly to impress a prospective boyfriend.  The two students were suspended, lost their scholarships, and faced ostracism.  It later came to light that she fabricated the claims, and has now been tried and convicted of making a false report.  She was sentenced to 3 years, and will probably serve 6 months-1 year in jail then probation.

______

From the news story:

Nikki Yovino just doesn’t seem to get it.

The 19-year-old Long Island woman — who claimed she was raped by two Sacred Heart University football players, then admitted months later to police that she lied to impress a prospective boyfriend, then claimed on the witness stand she was forced to have sex without her consent. Until finally she pleaded guilty to criminal charges, admitting her deceit to a judge — stood handcuffed Thursday morning, rolling her eyes as one of the now former players poured out his heart in court.
“I just hope you spend the time reflecting on what you did,” Superior Court Judge William Holden told Yovino, sentencing her to three years, suspended after she serves one year in prison and followed by probation.

Yovino agreed to plead guilty to two counts of second-degree falsely reporting an incident and one count of interfering with police, all misdemeanors, as the case was about to go to trial. She has already served three months in prison and likely faces another three months before she is eligible for release.

“This was not an easy charging decision for the state,” Senior Assistant State’s Attorney Tatiana Messina told the judge. “But with the evidence we had against Miss Yovino, we do believe this disposition is both fair and appropriate. Many true victims of sexual assault are often disbelieved, but that is because of cases like this and the impact they have on public perceptions. Miss Yovino’s actions are a disservice to those true victims, in addition to the two young men whose lives were greatly affected, and that was not something that could have been ignored.”

Yovino’s mother, the only member of her family there to support her, was kicked out of the courtroom after her cellphone went off.

### Takeaway lessons

* Hookups at a party are risky behavior, for questionable reward
* An accusation of rape is easy to make and difficult to defend
* The tide is turning; women are being held accountable for false claims more and more
* The wheels of justice turn *slowly.*  The young mens' lives have been turned upside down for the last two years
* The justice system can work, but it takes proaction and determination by the accused.   If you don't do your due diligence, fail to follow up with prosecutors and lawyers, drop your efforts because of all the hassle, or accept a bullshit plea deal just to try to end it, then its not going to go as well for you or for other men in similar circumstances",2018-08-25 02:32:25
40,You're not her top option,1694,0,1694,8uvmk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8uvmk7/youre_not_her_top_option/,203,1530327038.0,"Are you sitting there right now, with your phone in your hand, your palms sweating, heart pumping, mind racing, about to make a post on AskTRP asking what you should text/say to a girl over social media or how to respond to something she sent you or said to you?

If you are ever having to ask yourself, or needing to ask others, ""What the hell should I text this girl/respond with"", or ""How long should I wait to respond to this text"" or anything that requires any thinking and planning in regards to texting her, chances are, you're not her top option. 

When you are her top option, **you'll know**. There will be no doubt or guessing. The level of investment and attention she will be giving you will be off the charts to the point where its almost creepy or clingy. She will respond immediately to your texts, initiate conversation all the time, and always be available. You won't worry if she will respond or not. Escalation attempts/logistic arrangements are cooperative and accepted. Since you are at the top of her mind, its almost impossible to lose. You are all she is thinking about. When her phone vibrates or makes noise, she picks it up hoping its you. 

#You don't have time to sit there and wonder what to text her, what to say, how long to respond, how to escalate, or any of that shit. Because either she will do all the work for you and take all the guesswork out of it, or she will positively respond to pretty much anything you send her way within reason. It's almost impossible to do wrong in her eyes. It's like some kind of super cheat code has been activated.  

When you aren't her top option, **you'll know**. You will feel like you are doing all the legwork. She will seem cold, standoffish or rationing her attention. She will take forever to respond to texts, if she responds at all. Her texts will be brief and to the point. You'll get wishy washy communication and answers. You send texts and such worrying she won't respond. Getting her to communicate with you will feel like you are trying to give her root canal. She won't respond to escalation attempts/logistics and ghost you or give you vague wishy washy answers, or worse, try to change the subject and act like she didn't even see it. It's because you aren't at the top of her mind, and therefore, not a priority for her. When her phone vibrates or makes a noise, she picks it up hoping its her top option, and its not, instead, its you, and she is disappointed. This leads to negative reinforcement in her mind(since she was disappointed it was you), and actually depreciates you in her eyes and makes it difficult for you to climb up the ladder and become her top option. 

#It's a night and day difference when you are and aren't a girl's top option. 

You are sitting there thinking what to say, how to respond, how long to wait, and all of that because the frame is already set. You're not her top option. You're trying to figure out how to be her top option, failing to realize you are only digging your hole deeper the harder you try. It's not something you can negotiate, its not something you can do simply by texting her more and more. 

When you aren't her top option, the best thing you can do is withdraw. I know it sucks, and it might feel like you are ending any momentum you may have had, but trust me. The more you communicate with her when you aren't her top option, the more pissed off she will get at you in her subconcious. She has a man in mind, and you aren't him. 

When you are her top option, its blatantly obvious, you won't have to ask. It's easy mode of easy mode. There are really only 3 things you can do to hurt yourself when you are her top option:

* Self depreciation. I.E. typical beta behavior. 

* Going full, 100% player. It's fine to go 90% player with her. But too much and she will not trust you.

*  Loss of Frame. 

Every single one of those 3 would be self inflicted if you are her top option. Beta behavior? Self inflicted. Going too much player? Self inflicted. Loss of frame? Since you're her top option, things are in your frame, so any loss of frame would be self inflicted. 

That's it. You can do no wrong in her eyes otherwise, so it doesn't really fucking matter what you say, when you reach out, how long you wait between texts, what you do. Chances are she will do the initiating and the talking and the communicating and even the logistics arranging so all you have to do is not be a beta autist try hard and its you're golden ticket. Don't fuck it up. Easy easy easy mode when you are her top option is to **say nothing at all** and let your actions do the talking. You literally can't screw up at that point. 

#BUT MALLARDCOVE! I'm not her top option right now, how do I become her top option!!!????

Like I said earlier. **WITHDRAW**. I repeat - when her phone vibrates, when it makes a ringtone, she picks it up, gets excited and gets a dopamine rush, hoping its her top option. Then she sees that its you(not her top option) and disappointment washes over her brain. She then begins to associate you with disappointment each time this happens(negative reinforcement), killing your value in her eyes. 

Withdraw, and game other women, try to find one who will actually appreciate you because you're her top option. Trust me. When you are her top option there is no stress or worry, its easy and care free. That sounds much more pleasant than stressing over some bitch who doesn't give a fuck about you. 

#BUT MALLARDCOVE, I don't want to withdraw. I want her.

Drop the scarcity mentality, kill your oneitis. find options, learn abundance. But I know most of you fucks won't listen to me, so I'll say this. Withdraw for 10-20 days, forget about her but keep her on the backburner, game other women, and try to send out ONE feeler text to see how she reacts. Chances are she's not into you, and you still aren't her top option, so you'll either get no response or a wishy washy one. If you do, put her back on the backburner, wait 10-20 days, forget about her, game other women, and do it again, but keep in mind there is no point in continuing this cycle. Because if you all of a sudden do become her top option, she will reach out to you. You won't have to go find her. 

The only reason I put this here is because I have had limited success(keyword: limited) with the backburner approach before, but that's because I literally forget about these women, don't care, and game other women. So when I reach out to the backburner women, I give no fucks either way and eventually give up and 100% forget about her after 1 or 2 attempts. The backburner method doesn't have a high success rate, but the success rate isn't 0, which can add up to several extra dates/lays over the long run. The problem is that you fucks have scarcity mentality/oneitis, so you will not understand the core principles behind the backburner method and how to actually do it the right way, and you're destined to fuck it up. The backburner method doesn't fucking work if she's your only option and the only girl you are pursuing. Because if you are a chef only preparing one dish, putting that dish on the backburner is fucking stupid and makes no sense. 

#BUT MALLARDCOVE, just because I am not her top option, doesn't mean she isn't into me, right?

When you aren't her top option, she absolutely isn't into you. Women get oneitis just like men. Yes, they have men on the backburner themselves and backups, but they are not into those guys until they are needed(invisible). 

The thing is, women are programmed to focus on one guy, because that's how women evolved. That's why oneitis in men is inherently a beta/feminine behavior, because men evolved to spread their seed across several females. 

Women don't give a fuck about you when you aren't her top option, and it will be perfectly clear. Even if she tries to string you along and make you an orbiter/LJBF/friendzone, she doesn't give a fuck about you outside of what's in it for her and what she can extract out of you. She might be attracted to you, but she isn't INTO you unless you are her top option.  

#BUT MALLARDCOVE! I just got her number, you see. You don't expect me to be her top option right away, right?

Obviously it may be a bit of a stretch to be a girl's top option right off the bat(if a girl is anywhere remotely attractive, she'll have at least a dozen of viable male options in her stable at any given moment). But there is only one way to find out. Hit her up. See how she responds. Like I said, you'll know. I've had girls be into me and be their top option right off the bat. It does happen. You might need to build a tad of rapport over 3-5 message exchanges, but it can happen if you are attractive enough with a strong enough frame. If she's not into you, everything I have written applies. Withdraw, game other women, put her on the backburner, and if you become a top option for her, she'll reach out.

41,The Five Triggers for Sexual Attraction,1698,0,1698,5zl7gq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5zl7gq/the_five_triggers_for_sexual_attraction/,97,1489631764.0,"How often do you hear women tell you the following?  

“I haven’t felt butterflies like that in years.” 

“We shouldn’t be left in a room alone together.”

“Wow, how do you do that to me?”

Master the triggers for sexual attraction outlined in this article, and beautiful women you’ve just met will make the above statements regularly. 

There are five elements to creating an irresistible sexual attraction: 1. Intent 2. Tension 3. Eye Contact 4. Mystery 5. Sexual conversation. Fortunately, there are simple, practical tricks you can learn that will allow you to master each of these elements with ease.

	                                   Intent

Intent can be such a murky concept. Although it might seem like you’ll have to fine-tune your chakras or meditate in a cave to master intent, it’s actually a concept grounded in human psychology. Put simply, intent is your expectation of what is going to happen in an interaction with a woman. 

Intent is mostly expressed in feelings. Humans evolved mirror neurons that allow us to feel what people we interact with are feeling. This allowed people to avoid dangerous situations, if someone had a bad intent, they could feel that something was off, and so they would exercise caution in that interaction. Similarly, if you are nervous, a woman will be able to feel that, and she will assume that you must be nervous for a reason, your intent will make her lose interest in you. Conversely, if you feel confidently attracted to her, she’s much more likely to feel the same for you.	
 	
So, if you expect a girl to like you, she’s more likely to become attracted to you. How do you learn to project a strong intent? No, you don’t need to align your chakras or meditate in a cave. You can build your intent through a technique that psychologists use to treat anxiety, conscious reinterpretation. 

Harvard scientists ran a study in which they caused participants to feel socially anxious by making them give a speech in front of an audience. The first group wasn’t given any special instructions, and unsurprisingly their levels of social anxiety were high and their performances suffered as a result. The second group was given a very simple exercise to practice. Whenever they felt nervous, they were to tell themselves, “I feel excited.” They were instructed to reinterpret anxiety as excitement. The audience scored the second group as performing significantly better, and participants in the second group also self-reported feeling more calm and confident. 

How do you use this to change your intent? If you are nervous talking to a girl, you can do exactly what participants in the study were instructed to do, tell yourself, “I am excited.” Over time, as you practice this, your anxiety will turn into excitement, and she will feel this excitement off of you, and therefore feel more positively towards you. 
	
But you can take this even further, when a girl makes you feel anxious, you could interpret that as nerves, but you could also interpret that as sexual attraction. In fact, the feelings people feel when they are nervous and when they are attracted to someone are almost identical: butterflies in the stomach, fast heartbeat, and even sweaty palms. If you feel that these symptoms are a bad thing, they will make you feel uncomfortable, if you feel that they are your body’s way of telling you that you should talk to someone, they will be positive. When you see a girl you like, and you feel the symptoms of attraction, tell yourself, “Damn, she’s attractive, I need to talk to her.” 
	
One of the largest psychology studies of all time found that the most powerful trigger for attraction is the feeling of being genuinely liked by someone else. When you learn to accurately reinterpret anxiety towards a girl as attraction for her, you will allow yourself to feel more attracted to her, and as a result, she will feel more attracted to you. This is the power of a strong intent.
	 
                               Sexual Tension

Negs, pushes, emotional spikes, are all techniques used to build sexual tension. Unfortunately, they are also the most misused techniques in the pickup community. I’ve floundered with these techniques many times myself, I would walk up to a girl I thought was particularly attractive, and I would start berating her with negs. I was overtly teasing her to raise my ‘perceived value’, and to make her feel a lack of validation. Suffice it to say, this didn’t build attraction, it just led to uncomfortable, and short, interactions.

Why? For any teasing technique to work, there’s an important nuance that must be understood. Before you tease, you and a woman must be in rapport for it to have a positive effect. If you and her aren’t on the same wavelength, aren’t vibing, than these techniques are meaningless. 
	
However, if a girl is connecting with you, and then you strip her of validation, it will build a powerful sexual tension. To get her validation back, she will start to chase you. There are many lines you can use to make a girl chase you, for example, if she says she’s from California, you can say, “I hate California.” If you were already in rapport with her, this will feel invalidating, it will make her wonder if you really like her. This creates a psychological vacuum effect, to ease her discomfort, she will start to chase you and earn your validation back. 

There are numerous effective techniques, the key is to only use these techniques after you’ve already built rapport with a girl. The power of this simple strategy will shock you. 

                                 Eye Contact

Eye contact can trigger attraction on its own. Famed evolutionary psychologist David Buss writes in his book, Why Women Have Sex, “In one study, forty-eight women and men came to a lab and were asked to stare into each other’s eyes while talking. The effect of mutual gaze proved powerful. Many reported that deep eye contact with an opposite-sex stranger created feelings of intense love. Another study had strangers first reveal intimate details of their lives to each other for half an hour, and then asked them to stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes— without breaking eye contact or making any conversation. Participants again reported deep attraction to their study partners. Two of these total strangers even ended up getting married!” 

Eye contact is powerful, but how do you improve it? Whenever you are in a location with women, improve your eye contact with this simple game. Whenever you see a woman, look at her eyes, if she doesn’t look at you, avert your gaze after 3 seconds, if she does look at you, hold eye contact until she looks away from you. 

Over time, this simple technique will lead you to make powerful eye contact effortlessly in all of your interactions with women. Your ability to create attraction will be significantly magnified. 

                                Mystery

Like intent, mystery can be a vague, hard-to-understand concept. In high school I learned that it was attractive to be mysterious, and I heard that to be mysterious meant not to talk much. So, to become mysterious, I just didn’t talk to girls. Maybe this did cause me to create an aura of mystery, but I was missing the point.
 
To be mysterious, you simply have to make a woman curious about you, you have to leave her with unanswered questions. Mystery is attractive because it shows that you have depth, and women get bored of the constant barrage of uninteresting, simple, guys that try to get in their pants. Show that you are different, offer her some mystery, and you will trigger attraction. 

How can you do this without learning complicated routines? Say one line that she won’t be able to get out of her head. Tell her something she doesn’t usually hear, something provocative, something that will make her wonder about you. 

My personal favorite line to accomplish this? 
	
“I bet you don’t meet a guy like me every day.”

This line has an insidious effect. It proves itself true, very few men would say something so cocky, and simply saying this line proves that you are different from other guys, because other guys don’t talk like that. 

This line creates mystery, because she will wonder exactly what it is that makes you different? She will want to know why you would say something like that, she will want to know why you have so much self-confidence. She’s going to want to solve this mystery, and the only way to do so, is to spend more time with you. 

                           Sexual Conversation

What happens when you think about sex? Assuming you don’t have some kind of dysfunction, you get aroused. If you talk about sex, you will make a woman more attracted to you because of a strange phenomenon called the misattribution of arousal. 
	In the famous bridge study, participants crossed a nerve-wracking swaying bridge with a 230 foot drop to the river below. On the other side, they were approached by an attractive female lab assistant and given a short survey. Afterwards, she gave them her phone number so they could call if they had any further questions. Half of the participants called the lab assistant after crossing the rickety bridge, and several even asked her on a date.

This is in contrast to the participants who crossed a safer, more stable bridge, none of whom asked the assistant on a date.

This is because, like I mentioned earlier, the symptoms of anxiety and attraction are very similar. Participants who crossed a dangerous, rickety bridge were brought into a state of heightened emotional arousal. They were still in this state when talking to the attractive lab assistant, and afterwards they decided to ask her on a date because they thought their anxiety from crossing the bridge was attraction to the lab assistant. 

Similarly, if you bring sexuality into a conversation, it won’t make a woman attracted to you directly, but thinking about sex will turn her on, and she will naturally associate her feelings of sexual arousal with the person she is interacting with, you.

How can you bring sex into a conversation without it being uncomfortable or awkward? Play the question game. The rules are simple, you each ask questions of each other, the more personal the better. Questions can’t be repeated, and if either of you are uncomfortable with a question, you can ask to have it replaced with another question. 

Tell her you want to play the game, explain the rules, and to start you can ask moderately sexual questions like, “What was your first kiss?” As the game progresses, ask progressively more sexual questions. Because it’s a game, nothing is off limits, and if you go too far, she can just pass to the next question. 

The question game will allow you to comfortably bring sex into your conversation, and as she thinks about sex, she will naturally associate those thoughts with the person she is talking to, namely, you. 

Conclusion

Integrate these five triggers for sexual attraction into your interactions with women and most women you meet will desire you. Women want to meet men who turn them on, but so few guys get it, so few men understand what really make a girl feel sexual attraction. These guys try to prove themselves with impressive jobs, nice cars, and big muscles. But women don’t want any of these things as much as they want a man who makes them feel good, use the techniques outlined in this article, and you can be confident in the fact that you will give women what they really want.

The Australian Government recently released a study done by world leading Professor Michael J. Hiscox (Professor of International Affairs in the Department of Government, Harvard University) about gender biases in Australian Government Employment.   


The purpose of the trial was to increase the amount of women in senior positions of the government by de-identifying applications for senior positions in the Australian Public Service. We all knew what was going to happen. Turns out, when the CV or Resume is de-indentified, more men are employed than women, and women are FAVOURED in employment over men when their gender appears on the CV. The Australian Government (which is full of cucks) has decided to stop the trial because it was not helping women have more representation in the senior positions of the Government work force. 


Excerpt from study:

""We found that the public servants engaged in positive (not negative) discrimination towards female and minority candidates:

* Participants were 2.9% more likely to shortlist female candidates and 3.2% less likely to shortlist male applicants when they were identifiable, compared with when they were de-identified.

* Minority males were 5.8% more likely to be shortlisted and minority females were 8.6% more likely to be shortlisted when identifiable compared to when applications were de-identified.

* The positive discrimination was strongest for Indigenous female candidates who were 22.2% more likely to be shortlisted when identifiable compared to when the applications were de-identified.""



Good luck trying to find this reported or discussed in the news anywhere. The SJW mass media and government has suppressed this study massively.

43,Saw TRP in Action at my Job; I Buy it Now,1659,0,1659,6xnyqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6xnyqh/saw_trp_in_action_at_my_job_i_buy_it_now/,375,1504406174.0,"Started browsing this sub a while back. I thought a lot of the theory was interesting, made mental notes, and was on the lookout for confirmation in daily life. I found it some three months ago.

I am not an ""alpha"". I'll be the first to admit that. I'm active, fit, successful, but when it comes to straight out pissing contests, I generally lose. ""Winning through sheer confidence and aggression"" has never been my MO and likely never will be. Indirect confrontation is where I tend to thrive.

I got promoted about a year ago to more or less running the inventory and data analysis for my employer's global operations. Essentially a stand-in for our VP of operations specifically when it comes to inventory management and analytics anywhere outside of our home office. That means Hong Kong, Germany, Oceania, and other smaller outfits' inventory programs answer to me. The other 40% of my job is doing what I've always done: Inventory analytics for my product category in our domestic market.

Everything was going really well. I brought Germany, Hong Kong, and the rest of our global inventory into order (it was a shit show, everything is fine now). But it was tough to make people see the value I created in the home office because they didn't ""see"" me doing it. Numbers can only say so much to people who don't work with numbers for a living. Then about four months ago I find out that our VP hired a new analyst to focus ""on e-tail"". Totally blindsided, didn't even know they were interviewing. What makes it more problematic is that a lot of the forecasting I do is for e-tail. So whoever comes in is at least partially going to be absorbing some responsibilities from me. Still, not the end of the world because I have a ton of shit to do and am working on transitioning to a more global role.

But then I actually meet the guy. Total fucking Chad. Tall, incredibly sexy, built, cool, collected. You name it. I am immediately threatened, but force myself to reserve judgment because I have a tendency to snap judge people. My coworker, another analyst, tells me she despised him the second she met him. I even cautioned her to wait to judge him because I've been the new guy before and I know it can suck.

He has not been there three weeks, doesn't even know how to navigate our ERP and forecasting system properly before he starts talking about how he's going to ""elevate"" the forecasting. Big fan of that word, ""elevate"". He starts going through my forecasts and changing them. For those of you who are not familiar with being an analyst, changing an analyst's forecasts is akin to ""fixing"" a table that another carpenter made. It's essentially you telling them you don't think they're good at their job. And if you do it, you had better be fucking right.

My coworker and I are perhaps the only two people at our company that understand statistics on a fundamental level. She and I looked at the forecast adjustments he had made on my items and, just by glancing at them, *immediately* knew this kid was a fucking idiot.

The problem was, he presented himself so well and was such an alpha etc. that everyone else loved him. The men were buddy buddy with him almost immediately (he was so good at talking about sportsball) and every woman in our department save my friend were throwing themselves at him. I thought these were rational people. NOPE. The second a hot guy shows up, they go weak in the knees and forget me immediately. My friend told me that he had tried to talk shit about me to her, not knowing that we were super tight (We get drinks like every weekend and recently became business partners in our side venture. I was at her grandson's christening.). So it was obvious that this son of a bitch was gunning for me. Which was unfortunate because he *was* pretty hot and fun to look at.

He talked about his kids and wife to anyone who would listen, but I didn't care. I knew I had to get rid of him even if it meant putting his kids in the bread lines. So I started using logic and my knowledge of statistics to explain in our meetings why his ideas were wrong. Big fucking mistake. He just interrupted me and made stupid jokes at my expense and everyone laughed at me (particularly the women) because they don't *understand* the statistics or the numbers. They're morons. They don't get when the numbers are explained to them. They need to *see* it. It didn't matter that I was 100% correct, right? He would just try to make me look like an ass and a nerd.

The only way to get rid of him was to let him fail spectacularly and publicly in a way that he couldn't blame on anybody else. So I stopped reviewing his forecasts, knowing that it would cause us to be out of stock for some of our largest customers. I put in vacation time for three weeks about three months in advance, knowing almost exactly to the day when we would be out of stock, because unlike him I'm actually good at what I do.

I went to France and had two and a half glorious weeks with a guy there whom I am very attracted to. We saw the sights around Marseilles. All the while knowing that the clock was ticking. And then, on a Thursday, it exploded.

We were out of stock on thirteen of our largest moving items. Customers were calling to complain. Shit was hitting the fan. Who changed the forecasts to be so low? Oh, it was Chad. No matter, we'll have the other analyst fix them. Oh, she's out sick with a sudden and inexplicable illness? (She was actually at Six Flags, I believe; I had given her a heads up the day before) I guess we'll have to call that nerd we laughed at back early on his vacation to fix Chad's mess. His ticket isn't scheduled for another four days? Fuck, I guess the company has to fly him back here at our own expense because he needs to be here *today*! There are only first class seats available on such short notice? That's pricey. *And* we need to pay him for his vacation time.

I came in like a bat out of Hell, made a huge show of having to stay late to ""fix this mess"". I didn't point any fingers. His name was all over the forecast adjustments, so I didn't have to. He meekly offered to help me at one point. I asked him ""Don't you think you've helped enough already?""

Before I went home at about 9PM that night, I sent the owner of the company an email detailing, in dollars and cents, how much this fuck-up had cost him. At the end of the next week, he was gone, *all* the while talking about his wife and kids. Wife and kids, wife and kids. You know who cared *now*? Fucking nobody, that's who. They smiled and wished him luck and got away from his desk as quickly as they could, the women included. Typical. Fits right in with women avoiding injured males. He was damaged goods now.

Not only was I still here, but I had been given a bonus for my efforts *plus* being compensated for my vacation time. Turns out you totally can put a price on another person, and in this case the price was a hair under two grand. So in a sense, I owe Chad a thank you because getting him fired helped me fund my retirement *slightly* sooner while keeping me in vodka and blow.

Chad taught me valuable lessons: Don't tolerate for a second someone moving in your turf. Don't trust people to be rational. And I taught Chad a very valuable lesson too: At the end of the day, money talks, you stupid cunt. Welcome to the jungle, I hope your wife and kids have to go on SNAP, fuck you and the used Camaro you rode in on.

I now absolutely buy TRP, hook, line, and sinker. I never thought all the people in this department were my friends, per se, but I thought they at least trusted my *judgment*. But no. The only person who saw value in what I did was the only other person who also did it for a living and was basically my best friend, so she shouldn't count. The second an ""alpha"" showed up, all bets were off and I was chopped liver. Great lessons all around.",2017-09-03 02:36:14

As I turn I’m greeted by the face an older woman. She’s standing right behind me on the step below, and notices me turn around; looks a bit puzzled about it. Of course it’s kind of a weird thing to do to turn around on an escalator, I don’t blame her, and I can’t just ignore her presence as if she’s not there, we’re standing uncomfortably face to face. Hey don’t blame me she broke the escalator etiquette of leaving one step in-between each person. We have those rules for a reason man.

Okay so she’s not that old, like middle age, but I’m young so she’s out my range for women I can comfortably hit on. I can tell that back in her time she must have been a real looker, wall hasn’t smashed her too hard yet, nice hair and makeup, but I can see the tiredness of a long office day in her eyes. It’s kind of awkward though and I’ll look like more of a sperg if I don’t say something.

> So I say “Hi”.
> 
> She’s very suspicious of me. Of course, I got that whole fuckboy thing going on.
> 
> “Hello” she says.
> 
> “You’re very pretty” I say. 
> 
> Her eyes light up, then her mouth follows, into a big, toothy smile. 
> 
> “Um, thank you” she stammers out, blushing. She seems very surprised yet pleased by this. Her face looks younger and softer.
> 
> “That’s all I wanted to say-bye”. 

> I walk up the remainder of the escalator. 

> She laughs hard and then says “bye” too. 

As I hop off I sneak a glance behind me and she’s still beaming like a happy child, smiling to herself. 

When I got home I had this tremendous sense of satisfaction with myself, a wellbeing that followed me into a pleasant dream and a happy morning. It felt great.

So I did it again.
_________________
It was an underground train, and a girl hopped on in what seemed to be a cosplay. Had a blue wig on and the pleated schoolgirl skirt and the zettai ryouki; had she been older I would have been all over that shit but actually probably not because I still have mad anxiety with hitting on girls on public transport… everyone’s watching and can hear everything!

But I remembered what happened the day before… what if I just… complimented her…. and didn’t hit on her explicitly?

The idea that I’m not actually after anything and there’s no possibility of rejection at the end because I’m not gonna request anything off her was absolutely freeing… so I spoke to her as the train stopped into the next station. 

> “Hey, I like your cosplay”
> 
> She blushes. “Um, thanks”
> 
> “Who’s it supposed to be?”

She told me an anime that I didn’t know, and that she was going to a photoshoot, stuttering the whole time. 

It’s cute when you can make girls malfunction like that.

I was going to say something else but then the train started moving again and the Jubilee line wails like the grinding gears and billowing winds of hell itself. So we waited, awkwardly, in silence, while people around snuck glances at us. 
We reach the next stop. 

> “Well, have fun at your photoshoot” I say, as I hop off. This stop was actually mine. 
> 
> “Thanks” she says back, looking kind of upset I was leaving.

Once again, easy peasy. I was kinda bummed I didn’t get her number but she was also a bit too young and that wasn’t the intention anyway. I just wanted to make her happy. I bet her photoshoot went much nicer and her smiles were much brighter in the pictures.

And it didn’t cost me anything. In fact, I probably got just as much out of it as she did.

Looking back, if I set out with the intention of actually closing on her, I know for a fact I would have hamstered myself into pussying out. “Not in front of all these people” I would have said. “She’ll think I’m creepy”, I would have said.

But this… this was practice…this was benign, no ulterior motives. And in fact I just proved to myself that it actually would have gone well and she wouldn’t have gone super bitch-mode and girls aren’t that mean and strangers aren’t that scary.

_________________
I remember whenever my ex-LTR would get hit on by Incels and pickup artists she would come home beaming and tell me about it immediately. We’d laugh about their cringey lines together but I could tell she loved it because it was the best compliment she received all day.

Women love compliments. They feeeeeeed off of them. They live for them. They want them all the time. 

But compliments from friends and family come in thick, and they can be disingenuous, or repetitive. Does she really look pretty in that dress or is her boyfriend just trying to get head later?

But a compliment from a stranger? That’s a real compliment. There can be no other reason for it except that it’s genuine. Getting hit on or stared at by random dudes is a huge life-giver to a lot of women… because it tells them that they are objectively attractive, attractive enough to meet the criteria of strangers on the outside world, attractive enough that a dude literally broke social convention just to tell her “that dress really suits you”.

It makes her day. Quite literally. It will bring a skip to her step and she’ll go to bed thinking about it, a small highlight of an otherwise monotonous life.

So why not do it? Why not bring some happiness into the life of a stranger, and yourself in the process? It feels good to make others feel good. 

And it’s good practice, especially for those of you who are still having trouble with cold approaching. Go cold approach a girl and tell her you like her shoes, or she’s just so pretty you had to say something, or “hey, sorry I can’t stop staring at you, you’re beautiful”… and then just leave. 

Over time, after the first few nervous failures, you’ll get used to just approaching random girls, and you’ll find out that a lot of them, more than you would expect, are very kind and take it very well. 

Eventually you can learn to extend these into actual conversations, and then a number, and then a date, and then a marathon fuck session. 

But it all starts with having the balls to compliment a stranger.
________________
So let’s go over the benefits:

**1) Kills Approach Anxiety**

Immunises you to talking to strangers. You get used it and realise it’s not that bad.

**2) You realise most women are kind**

Teaches you the majority of women respond positively to strangers speaking to them and aren’t rude about it. 

**3) You realise rejection isn’t that bad**

Some will be bitchy, but who cares, you weren’t trying to pick her up… and then you’ll be fine and you didn’t die after… hmm, maybe this rejection thing is kind of okay. Maybe some people are just rude or having a bad day and it reflects nothing on me… 

Plus then you get to reverse her once you leave and think like “ha, you were bitchy but I was actually just being nice how does that feel huh?” Good shit.
 
**4) Abundance mentality**

Do it once a day, or whenever you feel like it, and you’ll quickly realise there’s a huge amount of very pretty girls everywhere and maybe your one-itis isn’t the only beautiful woman to ever exist. 

**5) You did a good thing**

And most importantly, it spreads happiness and good intentions without asking for anything in return; yet you will reap the rewards in Karma, almost instantly.

So try it, for me, and yourself. Make her day.

I have been in the game or ""red-pilled"" for 8 years now.

I was a virgin going into college and read ""the game"" and a ebook about college game on the internet. Forget the name. 

Anyways I got laid here and there but struggled with women throughout college and was generally awkward and socially unaware. 

I think the turning point for me was about a year after college, since then I've slept with over 100 women some were gorgeous and some were complete dogs and I don't say that lightly. Had a few relationships along the way as well. 

Anyways, enough about me - here are some simple tips I think would help out a lot of you in there. 

1. Women are not inherently evil. It's not their fault.

They are fundamentally different than us. Their brain has a different chemistry, and it's not their fault. They are the more vulnerable sex, and their brains have evolved to maximize their ability to survive and reproduce. 

They will always look for a man who provides them with status, safety, and security, while secretly or overtly desiring the alpha male - I don't think I need to explain what an alpha male is on here. 

There will always be someone better looking, braver, manlier, more successful, wealthier, or better looking than you. Accept that if your wife or girlfriend encounters this man she will be extremely attracted and her instincts will scream at her to sleep with him. 

Once you accept this fact, and come to peace with it - you will have a much healthier appreciation for women and most importantly an inner peace. 

2. Every woman is different, Every woman is the same.

Don't treat a girl like a robot. They are human beings. They are extremely different in their interests, goals, passions, desires, idiosyncrasies, etc. 

However, much like we are all attracted to a beautiful face with perky tits, a tight ass, and a nice body (for the most part), just about every girl craves an alpha male, whether they admit it or not. 

From the moment you first lock eyes she is testing you. 

If you think you have her in the bag and let your guard down, she will notice, and will treat you accordingly. 

""The game"" is never over, it's always on. Women constantly test us to figure out who we really are, in order to differentiate the real you from the person you outwardly present yourself to be. 

Even after you have proven yourself to her, she will constantly ""test"" you to make sure you are still that guy, and haven't lost your edge. (This applies more to long-term relationships than one night stands)

3. Judge her by her actions, not her words

Do not hold a woman to the same level of honor as a man and do not expect her to keep her word. A woman lives and dies by her emotions. She may say ""I love you"" on Tuesday, and feel completely different on Saturday night, depending on your behavior and her emotional state. 

Take what she says with caution, many times she is simply trying to illicit a response or manipulating you into doing something that is favorable to her and detrimental to you. 

Women are masters of emotion. If you succumb or react to her getting angry, upset, or vindictive, she will subconsciously sense weakness and question your ability to provide for and protect her. Remember, this is not her fault, she is usually not consciously aware or trying to do this to you, it's merely instinct. 

4. Do not swim against the tide. 

Make things as easy as possible for yourself. It is true that there are exceptions to the rule, however why make success with women an uphill battle, sport, or egotistical endeavor?

If you are 5'4 you will be most successful with shorter women. 

If you are just starting out and don't have much experience, go for the cute girl taking shots with her friends at the edge of the bar instead of the supermodel sitting with her posse in bottle service. 

6's and 7's can often be a lot more fun to hang out with and sleep with than perfect 10's. In fact, they usually are. The hottest girls are often not worth the headache. 

Have good grooming, work out, dress nice, and take pride in your appearance. There is such a thing as trying too hard, and I think we all know what that looks like, don't be that guy. On the flipside, there are plenty of out of shape assholes who smell like whiskey and dress like shit - and still get laid, but the chances are if you are reading this you are probably not that guy. 

Try to drive a nice car, have a nice place and have a decent job - that doesn't mean you should flaunt it or use it as a bargaining chip. Honestly you should do that for yourself, but of course it improves your attractiveness.

5. Play the numbers game

The more girls you talk to and date the less you will be concerned about each individual reaction and the girl will absolutely pick up on it. 

Remember, our natural instinct is to sleep with as many girls as possible in order to create as many offspring as possible. If you are attempting to hide, apologize for, or suppress your natural feelings as a man she will sense that you are not a sexually fit man and that you will sacrifice your dignity and resources in order to date and have a chance to reproduce with her. Again subconscious and not her fault. 

When you are single, always keep a dialog with multiple women, and when in a relationship make sure to constantly talk to and surround yourself with attractive women. Never let a girl feel that she is your only option and that you are desperate to keep her...once she feels that she controls the relationship she will start treating you differently, attraction will fade, and she will leave you at the first opportunity.

6. Girls just want to have fun

Of course there are exceptions, but the average girl just wants to feel safe, be taken care of, and have fun. 

If you take dating too seriously or give the impression of actively focusing on your dating life, it will signal a lack of options and a sense of desperation. Take what comes to you, you don't need to sleep with every girl on the first date, you are allowed to be yourself, and not every girl is going to like you, whether you like it or not and no matter how good your game is. 

Just some practical advice I've gained over the years through successes, painful experiences, and plenty of trial and error. 

One last thing, no one's perfect. If you slip up don't freak out - girls realize that we all make mistakes and no one is perfect. They care more about who you are inside over the long run. They will look over a occasional breakdown or episode here or there if you are a quality guy. 

P.S. One more thing. You don't have to have a pornstar dick to please a woman. But learn how to do it right and drive her crazy. She will keep coming back for more. Unfortunately there is no substitution for practice. A steady girlfriend is not the worst thing ever.",2017-09-18 14:12:59

I'm not making too long a post about this, it's just a rant to get the word out asap. There's also a [good post](https://archive.is/pKEjR) from a couple years back when the law was only being proposed.

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/29/domestic-abuse-law-controlling-coercive-behaviour

Naturally the law is bullshit, that'll never be used against women, despite manipulation being their everything.""Honey you don't make enough money."" this kind of comment won't be considered and yet ""Honey, you're getting too fat."" Will be considered abuse, even though both comments could be said by either sex. You might thinking I'm crazy, but really, I was just watching women's TV, because I slept in late because of a cold, went and had my breakfast and lo and behold a DV ""victim"", complained about her husband of 8 years, literally it was him insulting her appearance and his general disapproval of her ""Getting dressed up and going out with the girls"", regardless of what he said, because honestly it sounds like something the feminist narrative write. Even then she just left, but now in hindsight it was DV.

Ultimately all this is down to feminism, money, globalism et cetera

I'm just gonna quit while I'm ahead and am not too angry. 

On a positive note, here is [Erin Pizzey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnUwxxijr3g), she created the first domestic violence shelter in the modern world, because she was concerned with DV itself, as opposed to man-hating feminism, it's a good video to watch and she's a genuinely lovely person.


**Lessons learned:** Brits need to think about expat, need to leave the west behind, if you're white go to a country that white worships, which is pretty much most of Asia.

**EDIT:** Here is the link to the video I watched this morning, [1:40](http://www.itv.com/thismorning/hot-topics/mental-abuse-coercive-control-the-hidden-side-of-domestic-violence) they ask her what was the pyschological abuse she suffered, that in her words was worse than the physical violence, the answer is he insulted her appearance, how she managed the children and the house, and going out with friends.

48,How To Be An Attractive Man - 4 Key Tips,1596,0,1596,88o247,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/88o247/how_to_be_an_attractive_man_4_key_tips/,175,1522582611.0,"###After hours of research, I had found what I thought to be the perfect pickup line. I walked up to a beautiful girl and said, “Hey, I thought you were cute, and I had to say hi.” She smiled, said thank you, and we talked for a couple minutes until she paused and said, “It was nice to meet you,” and walked away. I never saw her again.

I’ve read dozens of books teaching men how to attract women with lines, tactics, and tricks. But after 10 years in the game, thousands of approaches, and yes, a good number of “lays” – I’ve found that attracting women isn’t something you can force. In fact, the harder you try to get a woman to like you, the less attractive you will be to her.

When that girl from the above example rejected me, I could have blamed it on the line I used. But truthfully, no matter what I said, the result would have been the same. This is because attraction isn’t something you do, it’s something you are.

Of all the times I attracted a woman, not once did I attract her because of some technique I used. Every single time, I attracted her because of who I was.

There’s a saying, “The self is always shining through.” Basically, no matter how hard you try to “make a girl like you” using some tactic, it won’t work because using a technique to attract a woman is in itself a form of overcompensation.

We only use techniques because on some level we don’t believe we’re good enough by default, so we try to make up for our inadequacy with a line or a trick(1).

I can’t teach you how attract a specific girl using techniques, but I CAN teach you how to be an attractive man who naturally draws women in.

There’s no quick-fix. Becoming the most attractive version of yourself requires that you invest both time and effort in yourself. But the end result is easily worth it. Over-time - by following the 4 tips in this article - you will become exponentially more appealing to the opposite sex.

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 1:
##Develop your Self-Confidence

&nbsp;

It’s no secret that self-confidence is attractive, but what is it, really?

If asked, most people would say, “Self-confidence is belief in yourself.” And that’s true, but there’s a key component missing in that definition.

Self-confidence isn’t just belief in yourself, it’s the belief that everything will turn out okay when you attempt something.

Self-confidence doesn’t mean you expect every girl to like you, it simply means that you’re okay with the consequences of taking a risk, even if the girl doesn’t like you.

When we lack self-confidence with women, we think that rejection is the worst thing that could happen to us. That fear causes us to filter ourselves in conversation, to adopt defensive body language, and even to speak with a weaker vocal tonality.

Our inner lack of confidence causes us to behave less attractively. The more confident you become, the more attractive you will be - because you’ll stop getting in your own way.

How do you actually do that? Well, how do we become confident in anything? Take driving for example. We become confident drivers by giving our brains proof that when we take the wheel, disaster will not ensue.

Every time we drive - and we live to tell the tale - we become a little more confident in ourselves as a driver. The same applies to dating. Every time you take a social risk, and come out the other side unharmed, you will become a little bit more confident.

For example, the more women you approach, the lower the stakes will feel when you walk up to a girl, because you’ll become comfortable with the possibility of getting rejected.

What this means will vary from person to person. For many guys just starting their journey, the first step to developing self-confidence will just be getting out of the house, for others it will be something bolder.

As you develop your self-confidence, you will become more attractive to women. Fortunately, if you utilize tip 4, the process of confidence building will largely take place automatically.

The most important take-aways from this are that you can’t fake confidence, and that it will take time to develop – BUT your level of confidence is completely under your control and improving it will make you more attractive.

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 2:
##Develop Standards

&nbsp;

The more women you’re willing to reject, the more attractive to women you will become. This is counter-intuitive, but it’s true.

If there is one thing that turns women off more than anything, it’s neediness. A guy acts needy when he is so desperate to be with a girl that no matter what she does or says, he would still sleep with her.

Neediness is suffocating. It shows that you take getting with a girl way too seriously and that you see yourself as incapable of getting another girl of her caliber if you wanted to.

Most of the guys I’ve met who have trouble attracting women (and there are many) have a problem with neediness. They see girls as a means to an end. They will happily sleep with any girl because that makes them feel like they “won”.

Men with this mindset don’t meet women to connect with another human being, but to get a sense of accomplishment from sleeping with a girl.

These guys don’t have standards for themselves. They see a hot girl as a prize to be won, so they are desperate to get her. Her personality is irrelevant. Her values are irrelevant.

When you see women as mere sex-objects, it’s impossible to have a real human interaction with them. And, naturally, a man who sees a woman as a human being is much more likely to attract her than a man who sees her as the fleshy equivalent of a gold coin.

The best way to eliminate this neediness that derives from seeing attractive women as prizes is to develop standards. Instead of being the guy who will do anything to get with the hot girl, you want to be the guy who’s interested in the hot girl but hasn’t decided if he wants to sleep with her yet.

Just like confidence, this can’t be faked. Pretending that you have standards by disqualifying a girl or negging her won’t make her see you as a high-status guy. You have to develop actual standards.

A good place to start is to make a clear list of what you won’t accept in a woman you’re considering dating (in whatever capacity). For reference, here’s a few of the things I won’t accept in a woman:

-If a girl has any kind of drug addiction, I’m out.

-If she’s unhealthily narcissistic, I’m out

-If she has a negative mindset, I’m out.

-If she is uninteresting, I’m out.

When I’m interacting with a woman, I’m screening her for the above traits. She might be a perfect ten in appearance, but if she’s narcissistic and uninteresting, I’m not going to sleep with her. To do so would be selling myself short.

The only reason I would sleep with that girl is because it would give me a sense of ego-gratification. I’d be doing it, so I could tell my friends about, not because to do so would actually be enjoyable.

In my experience, at least, sex is better when you actually like the person. Physical attraction is important, too, sure. But I’ve been with extremely beautiful women in the past who I didn’t have any chemistry with - and it was crappy.

Writing a list of the things you won’t tolerate in a potential sexual partner and rejecting women who don’t meet those standards is a powerful strategy for becoming more attractive to women. (Btw, it’s also useful to write a list of the things you do want in a partner.)

When you’re interacting with a beautiful woman and you’re willing to reject her depending on what she does and says, the entire dynamic changes. Instead of acting like a guy who would do anything to get laid, you will act like a guy who has an abundance of options.

Your non-neediness will make you infinitely more attractive than all the desperate guys pining after her. But this starts with taking a moment to write out what you want (and don’t want) in a girl you’re considering having a sexual relationship with.

&nbsp;

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 3:
##Improve your Appearance

&nbsp;

Looks matter. The better looking you are, the higher percentage of women will make it easy for you to pick them up. At the same time, no matter how unattractive you are, some percentage of women will be attracted to you if are confident, non-needy, etc. (and that percentage is probably higher than you think).

There are two important misconceptions about looks that must be cleared up:

-Waiting to get in shape before meeting women is a silly idea.
-Your looks matter, but they don’t exist in a vacuum.

A lot of guys realize that looks matter, so they decide that once they’ve got their looks “handled” they’ll start approaching women. This is problematic because it can easily turn into a form of procrastination. Your appearance is something that you can constantly improve, but you’ll never reach a particular point where you’ve “made it”. Furthermore, improving your looks won’t make game easy. I’ve seen numerous good-looking guys fail at game. These guys expect their looks to do all the work for them, but truth is you still have to be very confident and assertive to succeed with women.

The vast majority of guys don’t have the confidence necessary to take a woman home, and that’s something you can only develop through practice. Thinking you look good helps, but it’s not magically going to make you comfortable with social risk taking –(if only it were that simple).

Improve your appearance while also improving your social skills. It’s not one or the other, it’s both. Focusing on your looks while neglecting to actually interact with women is a recipe for failure.

Social skills, confidence, and physical attractiveness are all important when it comes to dating, don’t sell yourself short by improving one and neglecting the others. To do so would be as silly as learning how to shoot in basketball, but not how to dribble or pass.

That said, you can make a staggering improvement in your appearance in the course of a single day. Get a high-end salon haircut. Buy some clothes that fit well and don’t make you look like you live in your mother’s basement. Simply dressing better and having a sense of style will make you more substantially more attractive. It’s not going to make up for a lack of confidence and experience, but it’s a good start. And really, 95% of guys in the seduction community have plenty of room to improve their style.

I’m no expert on fashion, but here are a couple resources you can look at to get started with:

http://masculine-style.com/rugged-refined-and-rakish/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiAubtXLnFs

Obviously, when it comes to improving your looks, style is only half the battle. There’s no reason not to be in good shape. If you’re not already working out regularly, the easiest way to start is to go to the gym with a friend of yours who’s already in good shape.

Having a gym buddy will help keep you accountable to working out even when you don’t feel motivated. Plus, if your friend is in good shape, they’ll be able to help provide you with guidance.

If you don’t have a friend who can help you, there’s an unlimited number of fitness guides you can download. Find someone you resonate with and trust and follow their plan. If you have trouble being consistent, get a trainer to hold you accountable and provide guidance.

&nbsp;

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 4:
##Treat Dating Like A Skill

&nbsp;

Whatever you want to accomplish in life, there are certain elements that are outside of your control. - If you want to be a doctor, a low IQ is a disadvantage that’s outside your control. - If you want to get rich, having a poor family is disadvantage that’s outside your control. - If you want to date beautiful women, factors like your height, race, etc. can be disadvantages that are outside your control.

Dating coaches who say factors like your race and height don’t matter are lying. Sure, they matter, but they’re out of your control: worrying about them is only going to hurt you.

When you tell yourself, “Girls don’t like Asians,” you’re going to see your interactions with women through that lens. If you walk up to a girl, and she rejects you, you’re going to say, “It’s because I’m Asian. If I were white that wouldn’t have happened.”

This narrative becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When you’re interacting with a woman, and you expect her not to like you, you’ll act different than if you expect her to like you. Your insecurities will show up in your behavior, and when she rejects you, you’ll think, “It’s because I’m Asian.” Then you’ll become even more insecure, women will like you even less, and so on.

You can’t change your race, but you can change many of the other factors that create sexual attraction. The guy who wants to get rich but has a poor family can work twice as hard as his competition, and within a few years he can get to a point where he’s making a six-figure income.

Similarly, a short Asian guy with a below average face can succeed with women IF he works twice as hard as his competition and focuses on the factors that are under his control. His level of self-confidence is under his control, his style and fitness are under his control, and his ability to take social risks is under his control.

Look, with the above example, I said that the guy with a poor family could make six-figures, I didn’t say he can become a billionaire. Being a billionaire probably requires a certain amount of luck, the right family, being born in right time and place, the right genetics, etc.

But anyone can make six-figures with enough time and effort. The same is true in dating. If you’re naturally a four on a looks scale, I can’t promise that you’ll be able to date Victoria’s Secret models, but you can still bat way out of your league and hook up with attractive girls.

By treating dating as a skillset, you can date higher quality women than you would otherwise. If you fixate on whether you can get “perfect tens” you’re just going to cause yourself frustration.

We have these fantasies, whether it’s to be a billionaire or to sleep with “10s”. These fantasies stifle us because they’re so far outside of our reality. Worry about pulling “10s” when you can already pull “9s” easily. Treat dating like a skillset by taking it one step at a time. Don’t spend much time learning how to build attraction when you still have crippling approach anxiety.

-I know a guy who’s great at getting women attracted to him, but he always chokes by leaving the interaction before anything sexual can happen. He would massively improve his results if he focused on leading interactions forward by inviting the girl to the dance floor, to another area, etc.

-I know another guy who is great at opening girls, but he’s so quiet they don’t pay attention to him. He would gain so much by working on his volume.

 -I know a third guy who is great at dating girls who aren’t particularly attractive. But he won’t even approach girls who he thinks are pretty. He’s unnecessarily limiting himself to only date women that are far worse looking than he is!

I could give countless examples like the above. No, these guys can’t change their race, but they can learn to lead interactions forward, to speak louder, or to approach more attractive women.

In dating, there countless factors that are under your control. Worrying about the things outside your control is silly when there are so many things you can proactively improve on.

Don’t think about your race, think about your confidence. Don’t think about your height, think about your inability to approach attractive women.

Treat dating as a skill, and you can improve your results dramatically. Treat it like something entirely based on your genetics, and you’ll just drown yourself in self-pity.

&nbsp;

###Skill Only Comes with Practice

&nbsp;

The other key to treating dating like a skill, is to practice. If you spent 5 hours a week reading about how to pass a basketball, but never went out and played the game, people would think you’re an idiot.

Yet it’s common for guys to spend dozens- if not hundreds - of hours learning about how to attract women, without going out into the world and practicing. Intellectual learning is only useful if you’re spending most of your time in the real world getting real feedback.

Imagining what a good basketball shot looks like is completely different from taking the actual shot. Similarly, imagining what a good approach looks like is completely different from doing the approach. Information is only helpful to provide some guidance, it can’t do the work for you. Only real practice can.

It’s a lot easier to read about picking up women than it is to actually do it. I know this as well as anyone. When I first learned about the seduction community, I spent over a year watching videos without doing a single approach. Was it helpful? No. If anything, my social skills got worse because I became so overanalytical. Learning how to attract women without practicing is just as absurd as trying to learn any other skill without practicing.

Treating dating like a skillset is difficult. It takes patience, time, and effort to do so. Here are some resources that can help you if you get stuck:

This books both give you a step-by-step strategy for going out, meeting women, and developing your pickup skillset:

##Conclusion: How To Be An Attractive Man

&nbsp;

There you have it, how to be an attractive man. Any of the four tips can change your life individually, but master all four and you won’t believe the successes you’ll have.

Reading is how to do this is the easy part, becoming more attractive to women is a long-term process. Remember, anyone who tells you it’s going to be easy - that you can use some “hack” to succeed with women – is more interested in making money than in helping you improve.

Changing your life is hard, but what’s the alternative? Approaching women can be painful, but not nearly as painful as it would be to settle for a woman you’re not happy with because “she was the best you could get” (which is what the majority of men end up doing).

Fortunately, most of the factors that make a man attractive to women are under your control. If you’re willing to treat dating like a skill, you can master it.

""I had always thought of woman as possessing those delicate qualities of mind and soul that made her in her respects far superior to man.
I had put her on a lofty pedestal, figuratively speaking, and ranked her in certain important attributes considerably higher than man.
I worshipped at the feet of the creature I had raised to this height, and, like every true worshiper, I felt myself unworthy of the object of my worship.

But all this was in the past. Now the soft voiced gentle woman of my reverent worship has all but vanished. In her place has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies on making herself as much as possible like man - in dress, voice, and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind.
The world has experience many tragedies, but to my mind the greatest tragedy of all is the present economic condition wherein women strive against men, and in many cases actually succeed in usurping their places in the professions and in industry.
This growing tendency of women to overshadow the masculine is a sign of a deteriorating civilization. 

Practically all the great achievements of man until now have been inspired by his love and devotion to woman. Man has aspired to great things because some woman believed in him, because he wished to command her admiration and respect. For these reasons he has fought for her and risked his life and his all for her time and time again.

Perhaps the male in society is useless. I am frank to admit that I don't know. If women are beginning to feel this way about it - and there is striking evidence at hand that they do - then we are entering upon the cruelest period of the world's history.

Our civilization will sink to a state like that which is found among the bees, ants, and other insects - a state wherein the male is ruthlessly killed off. In this matriarchal empire which will be established, the female rules. As the female predominates, the males are at her mercy. The male is considered important only as a factor in the general scheme of the continuity of life.

The tendency of women to push aside man, supplanting the old spirit of cooperation with him in all the affairs of life, is very disappointing to me.""",2017-08-24 00:32:24

I predominantly date women between the ages of 28-32 at this time in my life.

In the last 2 years I've had 3 different women claim I've impregnated them.


Oh and the twist. I got the sip at 28, 8 years ago and I've had 4 sterile checks since.

If you are at the top, they want you tied down.


1 admitted lying about being pregnant to see my reaction.

1 recieved my text explaining I was sterile and i've never been contacted again.

1 remained adamant I was the father, and 2 days ago I was cleared of parental responsibility through DNA test. (The child was not mine.)

Welcome to the real world gents.

53,The female dating strategy sub inadvertently proving redpill theory correct. Oh the irony.,1528,0,1528,f9buqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/f9buqh/the_female_dating_strategy_sub_inadvertently/,309,1582673141.0,"So I’ll be the first to admit that I get curious. Sometimes like to see the perspective of the other half  , and since FDS is basically the redpill “equivalent” (I use this term lightly, that sub is a shithole) of TRP,  I check it out from time to time. Lo and behold, they prove our point for us. 

Currently there’s a pinned thread telling women how to detect “Big dick energy”, meaning how to detect if a dude will be good in bed, which basically translates to “high smv dude”, there’s a list of signs to look for and things to avoid, and i’ll go through it point by point and translate it, showing how it proves RP theorem true. 


&gt; The men that I found were skilled in bed ALL had these key traits in common:

&gt;They were always pretty athletic indicating good energy and a desire to improve / maintain themselves (I know this might be negotiable for others- but this was my experience across the board). I could make out their physique before the top was off 

TRANSLATION- Hit the gym and get in shape motherfuckers, a fundemental principle of TRP.  Literally the first point listed is also the first thing instructed to noobs on asktrp. 

&gt;They had a quiet confidence- inspired curiosity/sexual prowess- not bending over backwards being corny and desperate or trying to neg me (they knew better than that, indicating they don't struggle with women, insecurity or suffer from a lack of options/rejection). Neither did they have something to PrOvE.

TRANSLATION- Abundance mentality and outcome independence, classic sidebar material. 

&gt;They had lively energetic characters- knew how to shmooze the room with little effort - a natural charisma. Tell it how it is kinda people- without being a condescending asshole overstepping the mark. Playful, light-hearted men....again indicating they're not some resentful bitter insecure depraved gormless incel that hasn't been laid in 6months. Even if they're more on the stoic side- they still have a good sense of humour/charisma shining through. There's a level-headed temperament to them. 

TRANSLATION- Cocky funny, natural banter kind of guy, stuff that men on here are constantly taught to be when interacting with a women whom you’re sexually interested in. Social adeptness too, another high smv trait. 

 &gt;They were witty and fast on the ball- they could ping my sarcasm back at me at the speed of light without any whiff of fear (This is a VERY big giveaway indicating intellect/sharpness and ability to learn fast). Basically they didn't resent my (often blunt) sharp sense of humour and borderline insults poking at them- instead they humoured it and bounced it back in good nature- again showing they don't have a fragile sense of masculinity, aren't insecure and are used to dealing with confident women. This of course made me wonder why they're NOT thrown off so easily or having some butt-hurt response- hmmmm curious! With disappointing men- there's always a hint of resentment behind that- like they think you're too cocky or they're just a little thrown off (THEY SMELL FEAR they may disappoint).

TRANSLATION- KNOW HOW TO IDENTIFY AND PASS A SHIT TEST. This one should really go without saying, its funny, you really couldn’t make this shit up. 

&gt;They were good at reading me fast and what I like. They'd sometimes finish my sentences or guess my reply, like 'I knew you were going to say that'. Or they'd suggest something I would be into and guess it correctly. Observant and intuitive, indicating they read body language well.

TRANSLATION- Social awareness, what more do I have to say? 

&gt;They weren't thirsty, or awkward- they took it at my pace and knew how to read signals and when to strike. They definitely will NOT escalate crude sex talk fast if you met them on an app- these men know you're gonna want to sniff them out first and can hold interesting conversation but they may drop a few compliments here &amp; there: they're not rookies going to scare you off or become borderline insulting. They know better than to do that. Plus they also want to sniff you out for chemistry. They were still respectful and waiting for me to give them the sign, that way they knew I wanted it. Respect is key here- competent men know not to force themselves where they're unwanted or harass you- they have enough confidence not to act desperate. Again- big sign he's experienced with women, respects boundaries and knows what they expect from him. respected in order to feel comfortable and trust him in the bedroom. 

TRANSLATION- Again, outcome independence is crucial pillar of solid game, as well as being able to read and respond to IOI’s. 


&gt;They were assertive but not in an overly brash belittling kind of way. They had a natural instinct to take charge. They did NOT need instructions to be told to do something. These men have a certain level of intelligence to pick up on that without you needing to indicate. They leap to action which has some kind of hot protective guardian vibe, like they can keep watch for you. INSTINCT is the key here. They sensed when I wanted something doing. Again this translates to the bedroom as they'll know what they're doing and be enthusiastic to do it. They aren't shy or hesitant and will communicate directly. There's no hassle or tension indicating things will run equally as smooth in the bedroom.

TRANSLATION- “We want a dominant masculine man to take charge and lead/escalate.” Here at the red pill we are instructed that as the MEN it is our duty to be the one in control of the interaction when dealing with women. 

&gt;The BIG one: they were not lazy 'chilled' 'laidback' 'I like taking the easy, familiar route' kind of characters. They had a zest for life which gave off the vibe they led a satisfying life which is attractive and not lacking in some dept. It indicated they like keeping up pace and variety- not letting their life get dull, monotonous or boring. They are passionate motivated people, usually have a decent career/ interests, like travelling and are pretty upbeat. They have interesting things to talk about, and some depth to them (someone with depth /eager to improve will do their homework on how to please women)

TRANSLATION- “We like men who have a strong sense of purpose and a desire to live a high value life to the fullest.”  TRP encourages us to find our mission in life and cultivate an interesting lifestyle and hobbies, live such a lifestyle and women will be a byproduct. 

I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if one of you motherfuckers was just pretending to be a woman and typing this up. Regardless, this goes to show that TRP is truth, straight from the horses mouth. Do with this what you will.",2020-02-25 23:25:41
54,“All Women Are Whores”,1521,0,1521,78ed3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/78ed3f/all_women_are_whores/,264,1508861703.0,"Read a post early that got me thinking. Guy wrote an angry rant saying how all women are whores. 

My first thought. If all women are whores for you. That must be a good thing right? So why the anger? 

...oh because they are not YOUR whores. If they were there would be no issue. 

Most of you who have internalized the sidebar understand that it’s just our turn. They can never be our whores. So the only reason that can upset you is because of the ego. 

But there’s more to this. The problem isn’t them being whores. Because in reality. They are not all whores (at least not as the post read.) They are just AWALT. 

The problem is YOU. You’re calling her a whore because she left you to go fuck someone else. That’s not the issue though. She did it for a reason and the reasons are usually one or more of the 3. 

1. Your value/status sucks. 
2. Your  frame sucks. 
3  Your Attitude/life sucks.

**Value**

If you are a top tier male most women are not going to do anything to fuck up and potentially lose you. When I date women they tip toe when making a questionable decision. They make sure before they do something it’s not going to piss me off. Why? Because most guys fucking suck. Honestly. It’s laughable how little the competition is. They’re all out of shape. They haven’t heard of the word game besides talking about halo and world of war craft. Frame doesn’t even make sense to them. They dress like shit , Orbiting is a hobby, and needy as fuck, my god these dudes are so fucking needy (I hear women constantly complain about it). So as long as you form your life around the principles in the sidebar (that you see fitting for your mission) you’re way ahead of the game. 

If these women are doing things to piss you off so easily it’s a good indication your value or status is shitty and you have work to do. Because I’m telling you. If you are in decent shape. Have a purpose in life. Maximize your attraction. And know game. MOST women have never experienced a guy like you. They usually don’t want to fuck that up especially if they have been in past relationships that were shit. That doesn’t mean they never will but again if you’re a man of value you will have no issue creating a boundary or stopping that shit dead in its tracks. 

They are never going to be the ones giving YOU an ultimatum. If your given an ultimatum. She’s subtly telling you. Your value is shit. Take it as a blessing and lesson learned. Say goodbye and get back to the drawing boards. (Aka working on yourself.)

**Frame**

Your frame sucks. You care too much. You’re overly invested. She knows. You know it. We know it. Everyone knows it. If you were to take full responsibility for everything in your life. You’d never have the nerve to call her a whore out of frustration because you realize she’s just a women being a woman and you’re the reason this behavior took place. 

Now I know someone’s going to say even the best of the best get cheated on sometimes. And yes it does happen but usually they are missing something. Or did something for it to happen. In the rare occasion she cheats on a high value man who has all his shit together. they aren’t wasting a fucking second crying, moaning, or ridiculing the women for it. They are already on to the next one. 

All women are like that. They all have women instinct. They can and may cheat. We are aware of it but we don’t need to live in paranoia because of it. If you have your shit together like I said above it’s unlikely she’s going to jump on the next better dick and fuck things up with you. Especially if she knows you’ll leave Or you have created firm boundaries. 

**Attitude/life**

If you’re going around calling women whores. It’s a good indication your attitude sucks. You’re like the girl who whines about her ex to the new dude she’s dating. The guy she’s cheating on you with or “whoring” herself with is usually fun as fuck. Carefree. Living life by his own rules. Showing her a time she’s never had before. 

I have alpha widowed almost every girl I have been with (I know this sounds concede . But I’d like to give some personal examples). This is because I am a fun mother fucker. I always try to live that way. I don’t like rules. I used to get into a lot of trouble. I was wild. I’ve matured over the years to keep myself out of trouble but I’m still wild at heart. 

I take the women I meet to shoot guns they will never get to touch again in their lives. I show up randomly at their house at 2 am to fuck their brains out. I call them tell them get ready we’re going to have some fun. I take them to abandon places to explore then fuck them in them. I fuck them in their cars. In parking lots. On roofs. In playgrounds. Hang cuff Them while fucking them. Where ever/however I can that no other guy would ever think of doing. 

I do shit that makes them nervous as fuck. All the while I stay calm and laugh. Sneak into places you shouldn’t be. Sneak into movies. Sneak into their rents house. Fuck her in the bathroom at the grocery store. The dressing room at the mall. You name it I’ve tried it. 

Now think about that. If you’re a guy doing all this shit. HOW in the fuck is she ever going to replace your crazy ass. She can try. But like I said if she’s been with some shitty guys she’s going to be blown the fuck away. Not even chad can get her to cheat. And if she does. I mean honestly at this point you won’t care. You’ll have an abundance mentality thats untouchable. 

The key is to always be having fun with a dgaf attitude towards anything that isn’t helping you get to where you  want to be. Get out of your comfort zone. Experience new shit and be happy you’re able too. Make your life as interesting as possible and you won’t have time to waste worrying about people who bring negativity into your life. 

Life’s too short to call women whores. Life’s too short to even care. You’re Attitude should be. Fun. Free. Fuck it! 

TL:DR women aren’t whores. Unless you’re the high value fun guy. Otherwise Women are just women. It’s YOU that sucks. Not her. Fix yourself.

55,Technical conference cancelled after the blind review process selects only male speakers,1509,0,1509,6fnv2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6fnv2f/technical_conference_cancelled_after_the_blind/,283,1496803871.0,"GitHub is a software hosting website which many programmers use, particularly in the free/open source communities. The company seems to have branched out into producing other products that programmers use. It's all very hip and trendy, far removed from the traditional socially awkward hacker programming in some basement.

Recently they put out a call for speakers for a technical conference about some programming framework that they've set up. After the blind review process, the speakers were selected and published. So far, so good.

Then one woman notices that all of the speakers are men. She posts about this on Twitter [1]. The conference organisers respond by cancelling the conference, stating that the speaker list ""does not reflect the standards to which we hold ourselves."" and that they are ""postponing this event until we can deliver a more diverse slate of speakers"" [2]. So those speakers who were selected based purely on their merits? Not enough vagina.

I'm a professional programmer and I can tell you that it takes a ""special"" kind of person to be a really good programmer. Borderline autistic is a good start. One requires the ability to focus on the task at hand which such strength for hours at a time. And, of course, it requires an extremely logical brain. You can probably guess that all of the best programmers that have ever been are men.

Of course, some exceptional women will also display these talents. But they are rare. And even when they do appear, they often cause drama in the communities they take part in. Sarah Sharp was a Linux kernel maintainer. But she couldn't handle the brutal way in which other maintainers often communicate with each other. In these communities respect is something that has to be earned and if you don't deserve it, you will be told straight in no uncertain terms. Anyway, she ended up publicly quitting.

The sad thing about all this is that it is the male developers who will suffer. Employers are incredibly eager to hire female programmers. This always creates more work for the competent ones. And now it's harder for men to speak at conferences. There are literally no barriers to becoming a programmer. You just need a computer, which virtually everyone in a developed country has access to, and discipline. Given the extremely low barriers to entry, you would think that there would be plenty of competent female programmers. Or maybe they just aren't good at it, or aren't interested enough to become good. Who knows...

56,So you’re a boring fuck: How to become interesting in 3 Easy Steps [Part 1],1509,0,1509,32gcqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/32gcqe/so_youre_a_boring_fuck_how_to_become_interesting/,280,1428969673.0,"While men and women are very different, one thing we have in common is that the majority of us are **terrible**. 90% of women are basic bitches whose lives revolve around Netflix, wine, shopping, and naps. But we often forget that 90% of men are fuckboys who have no vision beyond videogames, televised sports, smoking weed, and trying to keep their dicks slick. We fault women as boring and banal but too often neglect ourselves.

The kneejerk response is that we’re all unplugged individuals. We’re miles ahead of Joe Beta eating cheetohs on the couch. But the unfortunate truth is that TRP consists mainly of Reformed Betas, and chances are most of us spent high school and college locked in our rooms studying or playing video games; which in terms of cultivating individual character and force of personality is pretty fucking terrible. Without real life experience, too often these guys express themselves through pop-culture references and define themselves by the media they consume. They lack an original, self-actualized identity.

Almost every day I see newly unplugged guys wondering how they can become more interesting and make conversation. Most of TRP is pretty straightforward: lift, read, approach. There’s an endless amount of information on how to lift weights, along with a wealth of resources in the sidebar on RP theory and game. But what do you do if you have the chiseled body and iron frame, but nothing inside? ***Many guys here already have rich and fulfilling lives. This post is not for you.*** This is for all the newbies who hit /r/asktrp wondering how to make friends. 

**Hobbies, interests, and experiences**

These three things make up the foundation of who we are. Women might be judged solely on how they look, but men are judged on WHAT THEY DO. *What do you do? What do you like to do? What have you already done? What do you plan on doing?* Either directly or indirectly, people will ask you these questions and you must have satisfactory answers. If the answer to all these questions is Xbox and jerking off then you’re doing it wrong. 

**HOBBIES**

These are activities you do regularly with TANGIBLE results. “Playing videogames” is not a hobby. Neither is watching sports, drinking beers, or hanging out with your bros. There is nothing inherently wrong with these activities, but in the end you haven’t achieved anything substantial. We fault party girls for endlessly pursuing good times without contributing or developing anything. While lounging on the porch lacks the glamour and excitement of recreational drugs and club music, it’s ultimately just as frivolous. Hobbies are more analogous to skills, rooted in pragmatism with tangible benefits. **Women don't worry about this because they are all born with a vital skill: SEX**

It is imperative that you cultivate several hobbies and work on them regularly. That is, at least once a week -- preferably more often -- you dedicate time towards the pursuit of each hobby. How many people do you know that “play guitar” but haven’t touched one in months if not years? If they even still own one.
 
To develop a well-rounded personality, you must pursue at least one hobby from each of the three cardinal spheres: **The Physical, The Creative, and The Mental**.

**THE PHYSICAL**: These are activities that strengthen your body and increase your stamina. At least three times a week you should be engaging in a physical activity. The very minimum requirement is weightlifting, the quintessential “lift more” of TRP. But often that’s not enough. Every lame half-alpha out in the wild fucks around at the gym, and for top-tier guys a weightlifting regimen is all but mandatory. A true physical hobby goes beyond mere maintenance of your physique. These are activities like snowboarding, rock climbing, boxing, and cycling. Even conventional sports like basketball -- if you take it seriously. Pushing your body to its limits and developing your natural agility, power, and grace. We might not be chasing down mammoths any more but you can still be a hunter and warrior.
 
If it is your sole source of exercise then three times a week is mandatory. If it supplements weightlifting or calisthenics, then once a week is acceptable. It’s not just about strengthening your body, but adding another layer to your personality. “I’m hitting the slopes over break. I just ran a marathon last weekend. Let’s ball after work.” You will have a hardness and appeal to you that most people lack. 

**THE CREATIVE**: These are activities that result in tangible pieces of aesthetic work. Drawing, painting, music, sculpture, singing, and so on. Most people believe that artistic ability is innate, but really it’s a matter of practice and commitment. Just like lifting and game, there are myriad resources available for you to improve in the media of your choice. As with The Physical, creative hobbies need to be practiced at least three times a week. 

That isn’t to say that multiple times a week you need to painstakingly hew Greco-Roman deities from living marble. Just as there are light and heavy workouts, there are smaller and larger sessions. For example, I’m a painter. I dedicate a single day during the week in which I go to the studio, turn my phone off, and spend a few hours painting. The rest of the week I just work in my sketchbook: drawing, sketching, and generally brainstorming. Likewise, maybe you only go to a voice coach once a week, but the rest of the time you practice your scales at home. Not every session is monumental, but you consistently make progress. If you can commit to those three weekly sessions, you’ll be surprised at how quickly you improve and how proficient you become. If you spend money on private lessons or take a class at the local college you’ll progress even faster, with the bonus of meeting young liberal females ;)

You don’t need to be a Renaissance artist to satisfy this hobby. Creative writing and poetry are equally excellent. Woodworking is rustic and timeless. Photography and graphic design are also viable options that are more modern and accessible, although significant effort is required to elevate yourself above the many amateurs.

**THE MENTAL**: Another word for this sphere would be The Technical or The Intellectual. The Physical will strengthen your body and The Creative will refine your aesthetic, but you need to challenge your mind in order to complete the trinity. There are overlaps between Mental hobbies and Interests (which I will mention shortly), but remember that the defining aspect of a hobby is that it provides tangible benefit. While reading about history and playing chess are certainly intellectual pursuits, ultimately you don’t achieve much besides knowing more about history and getting better at chess.

Mental hobbies are things such as coding, mechanics, and foreign languages. They can be financial pursuits such as real estate or managing a business. On a more Machiavellian level, it can even include human psychology and manipulation. They all require intelligence, study, and practice, but are useful and applicable. You can build your own website or design a new app. Save hundreds of dollars maintaining your own vehicle. TRP often recommends travel; consider how much more autonomous you will be and how much richer your experience when you have multiple means of communication at your disposal. Out of the three spheres, Mental hobbies most directly translate into utility and profit. 

***

These categories are not set in stone. There is plenty of overlap between the spheres. Dance blends the physical and the creative. Cooking and baking blend the creative and mental. Martial arts combine the mental and physical. **Even something as mundane as gardening contains elements from all three areas**. The key is to become a well-rounded individual who can contribute in multiple ways. 

**INTERESTS**

Interests and hobbies are often confused. While there are similarities, the main difference is that interests are pursued on their own merit. You engage in them solely because of their appeal to you. Hobbies are constrained through their practical application, but interests are far more open ended. However, most interests have zero practicality; you need a different mindset when you pursue interests versus hobbies.

The ""point"" of having diverse interests is allowing you to contribute to conversations. That’s it. Yes you can pull the sitcom routine and try to memorize various trivia on a subject so you can fake expertise, but your conversations will be far more natural, organic, and fulfilling if you have real knowledge of whatever topic you are discussing. *To be an interesting person you need to discuss interesting things; to discuss interesting things you need to have knowledge on interesting things.*

What do you do for fun? What interests or excites you? Answering these questions is crucial to determining what you want to pursue. Nature and the outdoors. Punk rock. Floral arrangement. Archaeology. Tarot readings. Classic literature. Tropical fish. Horror movies. Modern art. Taxidermy. Deep house. American history. Board games. Tantric philosophy. Magic tricks. Rock collecting. German expressionism. Astronomy. Hog futures. Interior design. **Your options are endless**. This is such a simple and basic concept but many people lack the basic desire to broaden their horizons. Ask your plates about *any* of these topics and watch their eyes glaze over. 

Take initiative and pursue your interests actively. You can’t passively sit through life waiting for opportunities to explore. Just like anything else on TRP, read, learn, and spend time on them.  If you don’t know where to begin, don’t forget that any of the hobbies mentioned in the previous section are automatic interests. They naturally lend themselves to other areas of knowledge. If you’re a cyclist, then you already know about cycling. You can discuss different bikes, routes, and maintenance, but it’s so easy to expand from cycling into environmental impact, public transit, kinesiology, health benefits, city planning, triathlons, and mechanics.

However, not all interests are created equal. Videogames get a lot of shit on TRP, but videogames are a legitimate interest. You can spend time and money on them, you can discuss them, and they bring enjoyment to your life. But when men on TRP talk shit about videogames, it comes from a place of truth. For practical purposes, **NO** women want to hear you talk about videogames. **None of them. Ever**. What you do on your own time is your business. If they help you unwind, God bless. But understand that certain things have a negative connotation that you may want to distance yourself from. If your primary goal is sexual strategy, it is imperative you keep that in mind. Regardless of how lame or sexy your interests are, they should all contribute to your overall frame of reference. Think of “water cooler talk”. 
Even if videogames aren’t hot, you can still connect with people who play them. 

The key here is to not separate and categorize hobbies and interests, but to pursue them in concert and combine them in interesting ways. For example, if your physical hobby is rock climbing and one of your interests is nature and the outdoors, then every month you go camping with all your gear and climb during the day while sleeping under the stars at night. Doing that is much more interesting than simply going to an indoor climbing gym and walking through the woods behind your house. You create something greater than the sum of its individual parts. These kinds of combinations lead into the third aspect of personality.

**EXPERIENCES**

It's very easy to fall into a routine of work-gym-eat-sleep-repeat. You sustain yourself – even stay healthy - but are you really living? Even if you pursue all the hobbies and interests mentioned earlier, you could still spend your entire life in a 10-mile bubble. You need to go out and experience LIFE. 9 times out of 10, if a newbie isn’t making any progress it’s because he’s spending too much time reading and not enough time doing.

Climb a mountain. Tag a watertower. Trip on acid in the desert under a full moon. Party in Ibiza. Get in a fight. Sneak backstage at a concert. Go skydiving. Date a sugar mama. Volunteer at the shelter. Backpack across Asia. Wrestle a large animal. Go to Gay Pride. Learn to backflip. Spend a night on the streets. Take two dates to the same party. Run with the bulls. Hike the Pacific Crest Trail. Go streaking. 

Note that some of these activities are HORRENDOUSLY stupid. But that’s the great thing about experiences, they are EXPERIENCE. And even the bad ones make you a stronger, more interesting person. Internalize the good. Learn from the bad. This is part of the reason why girls love bikers, criminals, gangsters, and dealers. They’re doing stuff. They’re exciting. They’re dangerous. I can hear the girls getting wet from here. Even if in the grand scheme of things these guys are in a shitty position, **girls would rather have fun in the dirt than stay clean and bored on the couch**. Girls would rather share an Alpha than own a Beta.

Again, this is all obvious shit. But if you never venture out of your comfort zone, you will never grow and develop as a human being.  However, it’s not about running around like a headless chicken trying to do as much wacky shit as possible. Yes, in the grand scheme you can travel all around the world collecting notches and accolades, but in the mundane, day-to-day aspect you also need to maintain an active social life. One of the more common questions I see from new subscribers is how to meet girls once they graduate college. *These guys have trouble because they don’t make an effort*. You can be The Most Interesting Man in the World, but you still need to put yourself out there.

Many men enter ""accidental monk mode"". I've been guilty of it myself. You read the literature, you hit the gym, get your career on track, and focus on your hobbies. But since a social life isn't spoon fed to you like it was in high school or college you never go out unless someone drags you. Sometimes it's because your social network is in shambles, sometimes it's because porn and videogames are convenient and available. Before you know it a month goes by and you're in a dry spell.

If you want a social life you have to WORK for it. Guys complain about never meeting girls, but if they were going to house parties, concerts, doing co-ed athletics, hitting the bars, perfecting their online game, and just generally expanding their social circle, you'd hear a lot less complaining. But that's hard. It's a lot easier to make excuses. **One of the core tenets of TRP is that you as a man are not entitled to anything**. That includes having a good time.

The next post will discuss developing a sense of humor, becoming more charismatic, and being mindful of the company you keep.

57,Cheap Sunglasses,1505,0,1505,cs3i2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/cs3i2d/cheap_sunglasses/,199,1566175159.0,"I used to only buy expensive sunglasses. Oakleys, Ray Bans, Maui Jims etc. 

I would buy one pair at a time, and every. single. time. something bad would happen to them. 

One pair broke. One pair was stolen. One pair got sat on. One pair got scratched up.

Every time I would get angry as I felt the financial impact of my poor decisions, fuck ups and shitty luck. Sometimes a pair had been discontinued and I would never see them again.

I loved and lost pair after pair. The brutal cycle seemed infinite.

Then one day, when I had lost my latest pair, I was at a festival and someone handed me a cheap pair of promotional sunglasses. 

Suddenly I saw the world through brand new lenses.

I took the new shades home. Wore them in my car. Tossed them across the room with reckless abandon. I scratched them, and didn’t care. This was great!

I did not care. Not caring was nice. I fell in love with not caring.

Then one day I wore them out to party. I had a blast. I was relaxed with nothing to worry about. 

I woke up the next morning and my glasses were gone. Oh well... wait... what is that??

That horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach came back. I had grown attached to this pair just like the old.

I thought I had found the solution to rid myself of this pain and anxiety. What could I do? 

MY sunglasses I loved so much were gone. I could fix this.

So I went online and found myself another cheap pair of wayfarers and all was good in the universe - or so I thought.

Then the first time I went out drinking, I felt a concern to protect my sunglasses. Why wouldn’t this feeling go away???

Somebody would pick them up off the counter and put them on, I would get angry and protective. But these were cheap sunglasses, what gives? I thought I didn’t care. 

One time someone put them on and broke them. I was irrationally mad. 

Then it hit me. I should buy multiple pairs! That way if anything happens to one pair, I would always have a backup.

I bought multiple pairs of the same style and things got a little bit better.

This was years ago. Over time I have become a collector cheap sunglasses. Every time I see a pair I like, I make a small investment and pick them up. I toss them around, sit on them, throw them on the ground and break them if I feel so inclined.

One day I wear wayfarers, one day it’s aviators, one day it’s something a little more sporty. It’s always different, always interesting, and always low stress. 

I have so many pairs I gladly give them out to my friends. It ain’t no fun, if the homies can’t have none.

58,The 5 stages of becoming a redpill Alpha,1492,0,1492,7ze8ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7ze8ua/the_5_stages_of_becoming_a_redpill_alpha/,270,1519327832.0,"I.                     **Newbie stage: what is this aggressive fantasy shit?**

The average newcomer is probably a young man, out of shape, n-count below 5, addicted to porn and ready to jump through hoops and into a relationship for the first sweet chubby girl who will suck his dick. We’ve all been like this.


Newbie starts lurking at the sub and at first is disgusted by the *women-bashing* that goes against his core values. The language is for sure very direct and vulgar, and the stories about how these hot college girls were competing to suck the cock of this older guy are really hard to believe.. “What a bunch of fake-macho assholes, they’re probably all virgins and this is fantasy world”, he thinks. Yet something rings true in these stories and for whatever reason, he keeps coming back to the sub.


**Lesson learned at this stage:** what brought you to TheRedPill is obviously you natural craving for pussy, but also humility. It’s hard to admit that a lot of things you have been taught are wrong, and that you actually don’t know shit. Humility is necessary for growth, without humility you wouldn’t have found TRP. Keep this in mind for the future, when you stop being humble you stop growing.


**Risk**: the risk at this stage is to hold on for dear life to your bluepill mindset and to your ego, and reject the redpill without actually taking the time to dig in a little.




**

 

II.                   **The truth sinks in like a dark cloud**


You’ve tried to resist the Truth, because it’s ugly and cold, and it doesn’t sit well with you. But the Truth doesn’t care about your feelings, it just is. Sure, in the upcoming weeks you will apply redpill principles and will be amazed to see them work so well, but you already know it’s the Truth even before you have had the chance to test it: Briffault’s law, the Hamster, female love vs male love, it just hits you in the face and you can’t escape it.


Let’s be fair, this is all VERY depressing. You enter the anger phase. Fuck this society and these lies. Fuck women, I hate them! What’s the point of living this masquerade? You recall all the instances when you thought a woman was actually caring about you, when she was in fact using you. You cringe at the recent memories of bluepill you acting like a doormat.


**Lesson learned at this stage:** Life in itself is no fairy tale. Swallowing the pill and learning the truth doesn’t make you happier, actually it’s the opposite at first, it makes you sadder. 


**Risk**: The risk is to give in to this desperate state, and say “fuck everything, I’ll just stay home and wank to porn and play video games”. You blame your thirst for pussy, and declare you don’t need women. Problem is, it’s not really about pussy in the end. Blue pill society has made you believe that it’s ok to be weak and the lowest version of yourself.  But now TRP teaches you that women won’t get wet for that, rightfully so. If you don’t want to improve and be the best you can be, just admit it and don’t lie to yourself by saying it’s about not wanting pussy. No, it’s about not wanting to grow. Looking at you, the angry half of MGTOW.


**
 

III.                 **Ooh so now women want me? I fucking hate them. And those amogging alphas too**


A few weeks in, you’ve hit the gym and the first gains are showing fast. Thank god for this boost of confidence, because the rest is much slower: it takes time to internalize everything. You try to act Alpha but you only end up looking like a dick, because it comes from a place of anger rather than confidence.  You start spouting some redpill truths that no one wants to hear in a social setting.


But at least you have developed some self-respect and you’d rather lose the girl than act like a doormat. And just like that, you start having some success, albeit limited at first. More important, your eyes are now open and you’re impressed to see how women manipulate and can be manipulated, how superficial they are, how much they fake and lie, etc. The more it works, the more you get pussy, the more you start to hate women for loving the new you more than the old you.


You get average girls with no problem, but your confidence is shattered the minute a true Alpha Chad appears. Suddenly you cease to exist in women’s eyes, he’s so much cooler than you, effortlessly. You feel amogged and you respond by being aggressive against this dude who steals your thunder, and you look like a douche. But as long as Chad isn’t around, you’re doing fine. 


**Lesson learned at this stage:** Be careful what you wished for. You wanted the secret code to have unlimited pussy? Well now that you have it, it doesn’t seem so fun anymore. Understanding nature deprives you of mystery and fantasy.


**Risk**: You start hating what you crave the most. The risk is to not snap out of this, and become a lying sociopath who relishes using and hurting other people. Also, your friends are really not okay with you improving and disturbing the social balance that was set in your group. They make fun of you trying to improve and, if you listen to them, you’ll be back to smoking weed and playing video games at home every night.

 
**


IV.                **You get pussy, he gets pussy, everyone gets pussy!!  And now you’re a social object**


A couple of years after swallowing the pill, if you’ve been dedicated to improving, everything becomes natural. You have risen to the top of your social circles. You have social power now, and you understand that this is the currency women live for. Girls, but also guys, bug you constantly and insist just to spend time with you. You must learn how to say ‘no’, to average girls coming straight at you, to beta friends who guilt you into spending another Friday with them, to family members, colleagues, etc. Your social life is boosted and your social media start to be filled with new events and faces. One good thing is that after hating women and their nature, you learn to appreciate them again, but this time for what they really are: bubbly, beautiful creatures that only live in the present and remind us to enjoy every minute of our lives.


Also, you fuck. A LOT. Constantly. Your n-count rises up by dozens in a few months. At parties, good-looking girls come at you and actually compete with one another for your attention. You have multiple plates, you don’t care about dropping some because there are always new women that you are vetting just for the privilege to become part of the rotation. More scaringly, most of your beta friends’ girlfriends have made a move to fuck you. You have, ultimately, the power. And so, the moral responsibility is now your burden, as well as the task to unbetafy your friends.


**Lesson learned at this stage:** Everybody you know, in your expanding social circle, wants a piece of you. Even if they can’t fuck you, they want to be seen with you, to show you off, just to increase their social value. You start to understand how hot girls, who get a thousand times more attention, become jaded and bitchy. It’s hard to have to reject people constantly while maintaining a good-hearted spirit.


**Risk**: You are now the king of your own little kingdom, you fuck 6s and 7s constantly with no effort, they just come knocking at your door. Your friends -and their girlfriends-  revere you. The risk is to enjoy this too much, be satisfied and stop improving. Soon enough you end up marrying a good looking 6 and get fat while watching football with the same beta friends you had. Still better than your past self, but you could do so much more.. This point is actually where I think a lot of redpillers get stuck. They stop improving the minute all their needs are met.

 
**


V.                  **Pizza is awesome, but in the end it’s just pizza. Let’s look for more important things**


It’s been a few years now, and you’ve grown into a full-blown alpha. You look much better than you ever did. Not only is your physical frame solid, but also knowing the Truth has molded your brain in a different way, and as mind and body align, you start to have a different stare, a different voice that comes from within, a confident demeanor, a calm and solid posture. People say you’ve changed, but they can’t really pinpoint why. This is why: you own 100% of your shit, you’re basically unshameable. If you get wasted at a bar you’ll still hit on the hottest girl, and will get her to come home, and if you go soft the hot girl will actually be turned on by how much you don’t care about losing her. You’ve had threesomes, sex with gorgeous girls 15 years younger, blowjobs from girls you met in an elevator. You don’t lie because you don’t need to lie anymore. You can tell a girl that you just fucked another girl two hours ago in the same sheets, it doesn’t matter, if she leaves there are so many in line. You realize the stories you read on The Red Pill when you were a newbie were all true, as the same crazy things happen to you, and more.


At this point, pussy is in free access. It’s like pizza. You love it, everybody loves pizza, even bad pizza is still pizza. A few years ago you would have eaten pizza every day if you had the chance, but now you realize it’s just a cool thing you can get whenever you want. You start to enjoy other things than women, like finding and dedicating yourself to your mission, the real friends you have, etc.  


**Lesson learned at this stage:** Now when another Alpha enters the room, you’re actually genuinely happy. What you thought was amogging a few years ago, is actually him testing you to see if you’re solid. Now you stand your ground and banter back, and both guys are delighted to meet another real man in an ocean of male and female betas. Also, neither of you cares about who gets the hottest girl because you have so many chicks lined up, and that’s how you know you’re both Chads. And when you end up turning one of your beta friends into an alpha, there is no better feeling than this.


**Risk**: In all your masculine glory, you have applied your skills and efforts to something (getting pussy), and have mastered this art. See how amazing that feels, to be on top of that mountain? But there are way bigger mountains around,  things more worthy of your masculine energy than pussy. Don’t get stuck on such a trivial thing, find your mission and focus on it.",2018-02-22 19:30:32

Put simply you've been lied to, and odds are you've been subjected to a [Poisoning the Well logical fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/140/Poisoning-the-Well) and a poorly crafted [Straw Man Fallacy](http://www.logicalfallacies.info/ambiguity/straw-man/). 

My personal thinking is that the creators of the CNN report that lead you here are guilty of plain old fashioned [Yellow Journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism). They tried to create a hit piece on us, and the manosphere in general, and have failed spectacularly. Besides, why would CNN care about little old us? What useful purpose could they have for targeting us? We're just a subreddit like the message boards of old. 

The truth is that our message resonates with millions of men and women because we cut the crap and speak plainly about dating, relationships, and the forces at play in our so called ""battle of the sexes"". Sometimes this ruffles  feathers, but our tone doesn't make our message untrue. Notice they always attack the tone and never the message itself. If they did they'd be putting a spotlight on how fraudulent the blue pill really is, and that would threaten the status quo. We can't have none of that, no sir!

This isn't the first time this has happened pointing to TRP and holding it up as something it's not. Now in all fairness we do have ""anger phase"" posts now and then, but they're not indicative of the sub as a whole.

Here is the full story as a reminder: http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/04/n-y-prenup-battle-winner-destroyed-family-with-affair-cousin-says/

This woman meets a successful millionaire who's built his own fortune through his life's own hard work and investments in real estate.

She wants to marry, being a smart guy he naturally is wary that she could be after his money.  She doesn't want to sign a prenup, but he says there is no way they are getting married with out one, so she reluctantly agrees.

Well, come several kids later, she hits the wall and wants a divorce.  She claims the prenup is the reason for their marriage falling apart, even though she never was forced into it. She could have always refused the marriage and refused the prenup.  But those were his conditions and she accepted it.

Well it turns out she was full of shit.  She was cheating on her husband with her cousin's husband.  When her cousin comes out against her with this, she has no option but to admit to it.  But she still insists her affair wasn't the reason for the marriage falling apart, oh no, she still insists it was the pre-nup.

Here's the real kicker:

She tells the judge that her husband had promised her he would get rid of the prenup after they had children.  That's what she says, that he made an oral agreement with her.  She has no proof of this promise or this oral agreement, its just his word against hers.

Well the judge believes her, and throws out the prenup, and now she is entitled to half his money, even after she cheated on him, even after he thought he was safe by signing a prenup.

Remember guys, not even a prenuptial agreement can protect you.  Marriage can and will destroy you, there is absolutely no point.

Be careful in even entering a de facto marriage before you live.  In some countries, being in a LTR with someone where you move in together and live together for some time as de factos can still grant the ex-partner your assets should you break up.

61,Stuff has Changed,1473,0,1473,8n6z8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8n6z8h/stuff_has_changed/,295,1527698448.0,"I remember getting into a lot of this back in 2008 or so. In those days there was just The Mystery Method, and a handful of other books on the topic. I used the information, and yes I got laid. My success wasn't immense, but it was enough for me.

Chad wasn't even a thing (that I can remember). It was just alpha and beta. The focus was just pickup. I don't think Rollo had even written his book yet (not sure). 

Now there's SJWS, The Purple Pill Debate, Incels (wtf), neo masculinity, and a lot of feminists up in arms about all this stuff. I kind of miss how it was back then. It was just guys talking about how to pick up women, and all the mandatory self improvement that come out of that.

Anyway, here's a little advice from a guy that's been around the block. Hopefully this won't sound too redundant:

1. Incels are just guys that haven't even begun to start trying. They are lost. The people talking about them have some weird agenda. Just ignore them.
2. Women will never ever admit to hypergamy. Don't waste your time. Just be rational and navigate.
3. Exercise is important.
4. Before obsessing about getting laid, ask yourself, do you care that much? Most guys are programmed to think that if they aren't getting laid they are losers or something. You're not a loser.
5. FATE is what I never see talked about much in this community. Some people are fated not to have too many relationships, and not because they are loser omegas or betas. Some people were born more for other things. Maybe they go off to war. Maybe they live in the woods. Maybe they strive before success gives them what they want. This is normal. Enjoy striving. Get a sense of your own fate. It will help.
6. There's nothing wrong with learning better social skills to pickup women. Holding a frame, learning to joke in a conversation etc are all important. The people that think this is bad are lost. Women that get offended even when a man politely flirts with them are BITCHES. They qualify themselves out when they react. Don't forget that. 
7. As you get older you'll be able to tell when a women is into you within a minute of talking to them. This isn't rocket science. Pay attention to subtext. SUBTEXT.
8. Women have to carry a baby for nine months. That's why this all seems like so much work. If you don't like it, strive or get to know your bisexual side.
9. Porn will fuck you up. It's just too advanced now for our ape brains to deal with. Jerk off without it.
10. This isn't a community just for conservatives or liberals. It transcends those boundaries.

And finally one last super important observation. I used to look at all my failures and blame myself. If only I had done X. Or if only I had done Y. What I didn't do was give myself enough credit. Maybe I ran a DLV spike because deep down inside I didn't like her. Maybe my failures weren't failures because I didn't stand up for what I actually needed. QUALIFYING is very important. You can't qualify what's right for you, if you can't stand up for yourself.

Ask yourself if you actually give that much of a shit. Ask yourself what you NEED not what you WANT, and remember getting in touch with your needs can take years!

YOU CAN'T FAIL IF YOU KNOW SHE'S NOT RIGHT FOR YOU. Talk to thirty women... how many are actually a match? Maybe one? Those other twenty nine aren't failures, and yes that applies to just getting laid too. Who the hell wants to fuck someone they aren't actually into? You see? Your needs matter a lot. Don't ignore them. Get to know them.

The End


p.s. No not everyone can master the day game method of picking up a total stranger off the sidewalk. Socially engineer what WORKS FOR YOU. The gym, a club, house parties, workplace, church, NA meetings, dating sites, etc are all valid ways to meet someone.

62,"An AWALT Classic - Girl breaks up with her bf for living too frugally only to find out he's actually loaded, a year later the story's changed to her breaking up with him for ""lying by omission"".",1469,0,1469,6l6bpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6l6bpm/an_awalt_classic_girl_breaks_up_with_her_bf_for/,404,1499193427.0,"Oh boy, buckle up fellas. Older folks on TRP might remember the original story of the girl who dumped her boyfriend for living frugally only to later find out that he was rich af and simply chose to live that way. As soon as she breaks up with him he goes no contact and gets on with his life and she cannot figure out why. She then finds out he was secretly rich and was *choosing* not to spend money on her and gets even more confused. Part one takes place in 2014.

**Part one - original**

> *TL;DR - My boyfriend kept his wealth a secret from me throughout our entire relationship. I ended the relationship on the pretext that he wasn't money/career motivated, he didn't say anything to the contrary. *

> I [F26] have been dating Will [M27] for most of 2014; I met him on New Years Eve, we exchanged numbers, scheduled a coffee date and have been seeing each other ever since. He's tall and shy, with long thick hair like Eddie Vedder. He lives in an older house by himself and drives a 1997 Toyota. He dresses very casually - I don't think he even owns a collared shirt - and all his clothes are minimum 1-2 years old. For income, he told me he ""ran a few websites"" and picked up piece-work as a 'session guitarist'. He is also very frugal. He never took me out for fancy dinners or anything. In the beginning it was always coffee dates, walks, hikes, etc. If we go out, he insists on 'pre-drinking' and refuses to buy drinks at a bar. Most nights he was content staying in, watching Netflix and playing his guitar.

> I never outright asked how much money he made, but given his lifestyle, clothes, furnishings, etc. plus the fact that he rarely worked, I assumed it wasn't much. I would lightly prod him with questions about the future, if he had any career goals - he would say that he ""saw me in his future"", but also he was ""happy the way things were"".

> I have Facebook and am on it every day, usually when work is slow. Lately my newsfeed has been filled with my peers getting married, buying houses, having babies, and other various accolades. I can't help but feel jealous by this; it seems like everyone but me is making significant gains in their lives and relationships. Three weeks ago, after seeing a girl I knew from high school buy her 3rd property with her husband, it felt like my relationship with Will was juvenile and had no future.

> The next time I was over at Will's (after he served me potato soup for dinner and was torrenting a documentary for us to watch later) I ended the relationship. I was perfectly honest about everything - he was a great guy, I loved him and his personality, but I felt he lacked career/life ambition and we wanted different things for the future. He sat and listened to everything, seemingly unmoved by it. When I finished talking, he said ""fine by me"" and asked me to leave. I went to hug him on my way out, instead he just guided me out the door and slammed it shut behind him.

> With prior boyfriends, we'd still talk or text a bit after we'd be broken up. Sometimes we'd even still hook up. I dunno, I've just never had a 'bad break-up' and always try to remain on good terms. I haven't heard a fucking word from Will, even after texting him multiple times and calling him once.

> I saw two of Wills friends at the gym today. I went over and made small talk, asked how he was, etc. I tried to explain myself, saying he was a great guy but our views on money and the future didn't seem to mesh. To this, one friend chuckled to himself and walked away. I asked the other friend WTF that's about it, and he says ""Yeah, we heard. The thing is, Will's loaded. He inherited his grandpas land which is leased to oil and gas companies. I've seen the quarterly checks he gets and they're more than my yearly salary. Good luck getting him to spend it, though. He has a 'if it aint broke, dont fix it' type mentality. Just look at that piece of shit he drives!""

> This has completely baffled and upset me. I dated him for 10 months when I thought he was penniless, proof I'm not a fucking gold-digger. I am a 26 year old woman who needs to be pragmatic, I can't just indefinitely date someone with the future being so uncertain. He could've said something, ANYTHING during our break up when I was explaining my doubts about our relationship. Instead he said nothing, and now he refuses to talk to me. It makes absolutely no sense.

>I just feel so low right now. If a man with disposable income meets a woman he likes, doesn't he want to treat her? He said he ""saw me in his future"", why didn't he care enough to share these things with me? He could have easily kept our relationship alive by being forthcoming. Someone please help me make sense of this situation.

Her lack of self awareness is astounding! I love how she just cannot seem to figure out why he's not talking to her after she broke up with him, why he told her to leave and didn't want to hug her goodbye after she essentially told him he wasn't good enough for her to stay in a relationship with. She just seems genuinely baffled - him accepting the break up and moving on is now a 'bad break-up'! 

**Part 2 - the update**

And here's where it gets glorious. A year later and she no longer broke up with him because of his frugality but because ""he had been dishonest about some things... [and she] couldn't come to terms with his lying by omission. It seemed he threw [their] relationship away over nothing.""

> In 2014 I went through a pretty bad break-up. I met Will at a NYE party hosted by a friend-of-a-friend and we dated for 10ish months. I loved him - it was probably the best relationship I'd had on a 'personal connection' level - but he had been dishonest about some things (not infidelity - 'life' things) and it led to us breaking up. I couldn't come to terms with his lying by omission - it seemed like he threw away our relationship over nothing.

>I was pretty unhappy for a while, not gonna lie. Went on a few dates, had a few Tinder flings, but nothing serious. Around summer 2015 is when things started to turn around and I felt I was in a good place. Happy with my job, happy with my body, happy with my social circle - just all-around happy and patiently waiting for Mr. Right to come along.

>My friends and I were invited to the same NYE party this year, hosted by the same person. I knew there was a chance my ex would be there, but I didn't care - I was over him. Seeing him and being cordial shouldn't have been a problem. He was pretty icy when the relationship ended, so even if he was there, I didn't expect him to say all that much to me.

>So my girls and I are there early, having a few cocktails and everything is going great... then Will walks through the door. He saw me, smiled, walked directly over and gave me a big hug. With his arms wrapped around me, smelling his cologne... I just melted. In that moment, whatever bad feelings I had about our relationship were completely gone. I just genuinely missed him.

>I got through 15 minutes of small talk with him, my heart racing the entire time. He remembered all these little details about me, my friends and my family - I couldn't believe it. When I told him about my job, my new apartment, etc. he seemed happy for me. When the conversation ended, he gave me another quick hug and then left toward the kitchen.

>My friends could tell that seeing him had affected me. They took me to a more private area of the house to talk it out; they reminded me to not get ahead of myself, he's still the same guy who lied to you, etc.

>When we went to rejoin the party, he was on his phone giving directions to someone. After a minute of eavesdropping it became clear that he was talking to his girlfriend. Fuck.

>I should've left then and there, but I didn't want it to seem like him having a new girlfriend affected me. Like I hadn't gotten on with my fucking life after 14 months apart. And so I stayed.

>She arrived about 10 minutes later and Will introduced her to everyone. She seemed nice enough, but seeing them together made me sick to my stomach. I swear she was being all touchy-feely with him just to spite me. I did my best to avoid them throughout the night. I found out through a friend that they'd been dating for 2 or 3 months. The party ended, I got into a car with my friends and just started sobbing uncontrollably. They tried to comfort me but I was too far gone. They dropped me off and I cried for while longer alone in my apartment.

>This was supposed to be a fun weekend with my girls, we had all sorts of stuff planned, but I ended up staying home by myself last night. No one questioned it, they all knew. I must've wrote 100 different texts to Will last night but didn't end up sending a single one. I'm going to stay in tonight as well.

>I want him back so bad, I just don't know what to do :(

I can't decide if my favourite part is her sobbing uncontrollably or how much of a boss Will is. I'm certain he's on here but if he's not he should be. Wherever you are Will TRP salutes you buddy.

New link because redditlog is kill

It's amazing how, if you read her post, she completely flips the script and blames him for not telling her anything. Even though she left him because he ""lacked career/life ambition"", it's his fault for not revealing his wealth.

Some gems:

>I have Facebook and am on it every day, usually when work is slow. 

Work is slow every day? I wonder what this woman does for a living? Probably HR or some other liberal arts degree related job.

>Lately my newsfeed has been filled with my peers getting married, buying houses, having babies, and other various accolades. I can't help but feel jealous by this; it seems like everyone but me is making significant gains in their lives and relationships. 

*Accolades.* *Gains.* It's almost as if she's viewing this as a videogame and wants the high score.

>Three weeks ago, after seeing a girl I knew from high school buy her 3rd property with her husband, it felt like my relationship with Will was juvenile and had no future.

Oh, the joys of social media. Apparently because all her friends are doing it, she decided she had to do it too! Apparently her boyfriend should be judged against her friends' boyfriends / husbands! Could you imagine how that would go over if it was the other way around. I can imagine some Jizzabel cat lady now:

""But honey, Jack's girlfriend blows him every morning."" HOW DARE THIS SHITLORD COMPARE HER TO ANOTHER WOMAN? WOMAN ARE NOT JUST INTERCHANGABLE SEX OBJECTS...

>after he served me potato soup for dinner and was torrenting a documentary for us to watch later

She says that to make him sound cheap, but if the dude can cook, has money, and knows how to save it instead of throwing it away and living in a perpetual cycle of credit card debt like so many Americans.

>When I finished talking, he said ""fine by me"" and asked me to leave. I went to hug him on my way out, instead he just guided me out the door and slammed it shut behind him.

>I haven't heard a fucking word from Will, even after texting him multiple times and calling him once. 

Dude realizes she's not the one for him, makes a clean break. Respect to him.

>To this, one friend chuckled to himself and walked away. I asked the other friend WTF

Sounds like Will's dealt a few gold diggers in his time.

>If a man with disposable income meets a woman he likes, doesn't he want to treat her?

And that is an example of how widespread BP mentality has become in our world. We are to be seen as nothing more than walking wallets.

64,Beware of Beta Bait,1451,0,1451,89cqze,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/89cqze/beware_of_beta_bait/,236,1522783904.0,"**Define**: *Ingenuine female acts towards a man designed to entice him with pleasure, have him chase her out of fear of losing her, compel him to console and protect her from danger and bad feelz, or have him give into her demands to test his value or garner validation or sympathy.* When fallen for, their egos are inflated, and the tingles are reduced. 

-

Below are examples of each one listed, the motivation behind them, and how to respond. 

-

----------------------
----------------------

-

**1)** HER sending sexually suggestive pictures

* **Example A**: Kid on askTRP received sexy pics from some girl. OP took this as a sign of a guaranteed lay and proceeded to tell her how hot it was and what he wanted to do to her. Girl loses interest. He's left confused.

-

The purpose of the girl sending a naughty pic in the the askTRP kid's situation was to see if he'd drool over her. She was dangling pussy on a stick to see if he'd try to pounce on it immediately. He did, thus demonstrating low value via thirst. **Women want you to escalate while showing sexual restraint**. By not going for the kill, she perceives you as not desperate because you have other options and this is nothing special. Male sexuality is based almost entirely on physique while female sexuality focuses on refusal to give them short-term validation in response to their power grabbing moves and other *abstract* traits that *indirectly* insinuate signs of past sexual success, not your looks or body (especially hot girls).

-

Before the phones became 'smart phones', when they were flip-phones with a pull-out antennae, press buttons, a low resolution camera, and a very primitive email app, if it had apps at all, this would be a different story. When texting was invented, Myspace was in its infancy, Youtube just came out, and Napster and Limewire were cool, a naughty pic would be a sure sign of DTF. But now historical internet porn is common Instagram photos of everyday girls. They post pictures of them dressed and posed in a manner only hookers were known for in the not so far past. **Suggestive pics don't mean shit anymore. That pic she sent wasn't spontaneous out of lust for you, it was one carefully crafted long ago she had saved on her phone and is probably somewhere on the internet already and was sent to several guys in the past**.

-

Men send suggestive pics (i.e. [dick pics](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=krHKxPzl2-A)) in hopes of invoking a woman's arousal enough to want to fuck with low effort. Women send suggestive images to acquire validation and test your value. She has little concern, if at all, for sex, although intrigued. Far from the finish line. 

-

 * **Example B**: Friend of mine matched with a girl on Tinder and began to exchange messages. Tinder girl starts playing games. Friend says bye and unmatches her. Tinder girl later follows him on Snapchat. She sends him a sexy pic. Friend sends one back. She's send another in addition with a ""you gotta earn it"" -like line. Friend laughs and says no thanks. Girl throws a tantrum. 

-

In this case, the girl tried to use her pussy to get my friend to jump through hoops in hopes of sex that was likely never to come to boost her ego. When that didn't work, she went into frame recovery mode. She sent that first pic hoping she would get my friend to do what the askTRP kid in the Example A did, smother her in validation. My friend's response pic wasn't good enough, she wants an overt display to feel a sense of power. So she sends another thinking she can reel him in with the same games she played during the Tinder convo. My friend sees what's up and just ghosts her. If my friend did what the askTRP kid did, she would immediately withdraw and cease contact with him ==> *""teehee, I win. Bye""*. It's all just a game to her. Validation is sex to women. Sex is secondary, often times a 'last resort' way of acquiring the validation they failed to get in the beginning. 

-

edit: **What to Do**: When you recieve one of these pics, give her a small compliment, but nothing more. ""That's hot."", ""bad girl"", anything that suggests slight interest or is sexual. Even tell her you'd like to see her in a specific color or whatever, but don't drool. Keep it short and sweet and wait at least a few minutes before responding to it. The game isn't over yet.

- 

**TL;DR** pics ain't shit. Anything not face to face doesn't matter. [You say yousa freak, you gon' prove it or nah?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUj0otkJEBo)

-

-------------------

-

**2)** HER talking about other guys hitting on her

-

* **Example A**: An ex-girlfriend and I were doing the long distance relationship thing during college. I got a text one evening stating that she had guys ask her out but refused them saying she had a boyfriend. Me: *""Good.""* She then replied with *""I just wanted to you to know that you could trust me.""*

-

Sounds so nice right? She's letting you know you can trust her! If you believe that, you're clueless. **She didn't send this text to alleviate my anxieties, but to INSTILL them in me. It's dread game disguised as noble intention** (plausible deniability), a favorite weapon among ALL women's psychological warchests. Not AWALT, *all women DO that*. She wanted to see me get jealous and worried by blowing up her phone. She wished to see the power she had over me.

-

The best way to respond is ""okay"" or ""I trust you"". That's it. She will likely attempt to instigate drama by bringing it up again and again, attempting to 'reassure you of her loyalty'. Don't fall for it. She may even try to peg the blame on you for not being worried enough. Don't give this a second thought. Drama is for women. **When you wrestle with pigs you both get dirty and the pigs like it**. 

-

I've heard this tactic take many forms like a guy tried to kiss her or touched her butt or men from her sexual past or whatever. Same shit. 

-

 * **Example B**: Same girl told me that she hung with a 'friend' the other day while driving somewhere. Me: ""okay"". Didn't give it any attention. I noticed her looking uncomfortable...... While sitting on her couch later that day, she wanted to confess that it was an ex-boyfriend, but assured me I had nothing to worry about. I ignored it, but the direct acknowledgement of it started to bother me. Come Christmas Eve night, I told her we should 'talk' about it. Long story short, I cried like a faggot with her on her porch bench, telling each other we'll be together forever and trust one another. Christmas Day, family and I were opening presents. My father noticed I was down. I told him what happened. He gave me some tips on how to handle it. Felt better, applied the tips, and it worked in the future. 

-

She told me this instill dread in me. She insisted on telling me because she wanted to be punished for her bad behavior. Women had a deep seated need to observe you setting boundaries. What do you do if a woman decides to do 1-on-1 meetups with ex-boyfriend or other dudes? **Answer**: When a woman indirectly mentions other men, ignore it. When she 'confesses', punish her indirectly by withdrawing attention with no explanation or a bullshit one. Women don't communicate directly. [What to do when your girl wants to hang out with another guy 1-on-1? ==> Demote to plate or dump immediately](http://archive.is/I0G8l)...

-

-------------------

-

**3)** A girl threatening to leave your presence

-

I was at a bar once. At a table near an exit was a trio. A couple and the girl's friend. The conversation between the couple slowly escalated into an argument and the girl began to creep backwards towards the door while talking to the boyfriend. She slung her last insult and announced, ""I'm leaving!"", then stomped out of the building. The boyfriend soon followed her and started calling out to her to resolved the issue. Don't know what happened next, but not relevant.

-

**Patrice O'Neal**: *""What will you do when she takes the pussy hostage and puts a gun to it's head?""*

-

When a girl starts walking away from you, don't chase. When she announces the infamous, *""I'm leaving""*, she's really saying *""I, the beholder of the pussy and my vaginal affections are exiting!""* She's saying, *""Chase me so I feel validated about the power I hold over you!""* That's exactly what it this scenic act was about: ego, power, and validation.

-

If you try to get her not to leave, you fluff her ego and decrease the tingles. Let her stomp off like a child and blow off some steam. It's hard when she's an LTR and you have put in emotional investment, but that's when it matters the most.  Understand that women need these moments of emotional spikes to feel alive. She NEEDS them for her own good. 

-

""Go kick rocks, bitch"" should be your attitude. If she's being ridiculous, be the first to withdraw by telling her to go away if she wants to continue acting the way she is. Big chance she doesn't, because the point of her leaving was to compel you to grovel and have the situation in her [frame](https://archive.fo/QCnET). She can't frame her exit this way if you initiate it. That would be a defeat. Doesn't matter if you were her ride, that's her problem. She can call an Uber or a friend or parent or some beta chump sitting around. Doesn't even matter if she exits the car (bonus points if you stop on the side and kick her out, not accepting pseudo last minute apologies). Don't be like Kelso was with Jackie in [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXRSVvsOg8g). And never initiate contact! Don't keep an eye on her, especially if she starts talking to another guy (she's just doing it to make you jealous and fluff her ego). 

-

I guarantee if you don't chase her or contact her, she'll do one of these things:

 * **A)** Come straight back. You called her bluff.

 * **B)** Say sorry (especially if you told her to leave)

In case A, remain dismissive and show no affection. No apology (especially if didn't do anything wrong you pussy). In case B, if you have deemed this event as a reconcilable offense, make her wait before you respond. Don't discuss the matter in any detail or try to explain your side of the story in an attempt to garner sympathy (she doesn't care about you, she cares about the validation). In either case, you must make her work to return to your good graces, else she won't respect it. 

-

 * **C)** She'll taunt you some more by shifting the blame on you. She'll consider your indifference to her absence as evidence of the 'crime' of not 'caring about the relationship', and attempt to get you to accept liability.

-

This is psy-ops. Don't fall for it. Even if you were somewhat in the wrong, NEVER accept a woman's frame. *EVER*. 

-

>**My Story**: I remember a night with an old girlfriend where she did something to piss me off at the mall. I instantly became cold towards her and we left. Didn't speak to her in the car. She started looking to me for signs of validation in the corner of my eye with puppy dog eyes, a slight frown, and a submissive posture.  Didn't speak to her in the car. I had to get something from the store, didn't speak to her in the store much. We were in separate aisles. By then I had cooled down and we ran into each other in another aisle. I just slowly walked toward her without saying anything and hugged her. Then we walked out the store without me saying anything or showing affection. When we got in the car, she apologized and had some tears. I just put my hand on her leg and said, *""shhhh""*. The conversation eventually turned a little humorous and we kissed. It was the most passionate kiss I ever received from her. She was more kind and affectionate than usual for the next couple days. That was our first 'conflict'. Not exactly as described earlier, but close enough.

-

Make-up sex is often the best sex. At the end of an emotional roller coaster, is wet pussy. The the cycle of drama brings catharsis. This is where *""treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen""* comes from. This is why girls 'stay with' (continue to have sex with) boyfriends that treat them badly. 

-

----------------

-

**4)** A girl threatening or implying the end of the relationship

-
**Read**: [By the time you have 'the talk', she's already packed and planned her exit](https://archive.fo/lKkgP)

-

---------------

-

**5)** Overt communication

-

Women are not like men, they communicate their intentions covertly. When a woman blatantly discusses her intentions or sexual topics, it's a trap or a shit test.

-  She puts up impenetrable LMR. You get frustrated and go cold and do something else. Then she says, ""are you mad because I wouldn't have sex with you?""

-

There are other examples I can't quite put my finger on, but I think you get the idea. Explicitly stating the unspoken dynamic is not what women do. 

-

edit: **What to do**: Ignore and pretend it never happened. ""No it's fine, I'm not gonna pressure into doing anything you don't wanna do."" Play it cool. Just lay down. Some convo. Then say what you need to say to exit or have her leave in a non-butthurt manner. Nothing you can do. Never mention previous ASD. Just sounds butthurt, spirals down a path of no tingles, and activates more ASD. Never remind a woman why she denied sex to you. 

-

------------

-

**6)** Claims she is in some kind of danger

-

**Example**: An ex-gf of mine was at the mall ~40 mins away. She sent a text ""I think these guys are following me"". I then instantly gave her advice on how to handle it and to call me if she needs help. Revenge fantasies flowed through my mind, what I would do to guys who'd try to hurt her. She then instantly said, ""no it's okay. but thanks. It's nothing I can't handle."" 

-

This was pre-meditated. She just wanted her ego boosted by seeing me willing to come to her rescue. There could have been no men at all, she just made it up. The details of her story aren't important, just the outcome. 

-

How to handle it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_ueWyMpLhE (00:40s is the most relevant part)

-

 * There was a post here about this very video and a girl's reaction to it a long time ago. If you could find it, post the link in the comments section. 

-

---------------

-

**7)** Pseudo displays of sexual receptivity (attention whoring)

-

* **Example:** I was at the bar section of a venue. Down by the pool tables were two girls (early 20's). They had this hot-slut look. High boots and uggs. Skinny jeans wrapped around their big posteriors and up on the hips. Mid-section exposed below shirt. Makeup. Earrings. Rings. Necklace. Can't really explain the 'slut look'. They walked towards one particular table. One girl leans back, using the table as support.The other in front of her. They begin grinding on each other aggressively with considerable space from everyone else. They tried to make it look like they were 'just having girl fun, woooohooooo!'. At the end of this erotic display, they returned to the group they came with like nothing happened. They spoke loudly. They flirted with nobody their entire stay, not even the guys with them. 

-

Attention whoring, that's all that was. All they wanted was for men to stare at them. [That validation alone satisfied them](http://archive.is/GspuI). If you were to try to hit on them, you'd fail. They continuously pranced from one side of the bar to the other as a duo. Always quick on the move, flighty, and loud with each other as if trying to have their presence known. At one of their brief stops that just so happen to be in my vicinity, I over heard a conversation with them. One of the sluts was talking about the relief and delight she felt hearing that her baby daddy was going to be released from prison in a few months. Supposedly, he was incarcerated for shooting somebody. 

-

I've only known one guy who can keep these types of girl's attention (the guy mention in 'No. 1, Example B').  He has mastered the art of loud clown game at bars that draws the attention whores to him. He will dress provocatively via peacocking, will ante up the girls high energy, and become the center of attention instead of the hot women, basically the guy version of what the girls were doing, but better than them. He gets off on the whole bar scene, loves it for the sake of it, women or no women. It's his element like a fish in water. It comes off natural. They can only get attention because of their pussy, he gets it because they think he's the fun guy, thus is worth more. These women can't beat an attention competitor, so they try to join him, or rather attach themselves to him. 

-

These women's display of attention seeking acts (dance, loud talk, and walking all over the place) create an illusion of immediate receptiveness. False. This is a chump trap. The barrier to entry is quite high. If you're not Mr. Baby Daddy People Shooter or my friend Mr Clown Game Master, you're not getting any action. Promise.  

-

Don’t be fooled, [you still need game to bang sluts](http://archive.is/jU0Rd)

-

-------------------

-

**8)** 'Rapport Bombing'

Women are selfish. Women will take a perfectly good conversation and intentionally sabotage it for feelz. If you follow her down this path, you'll get no lady-hole. Anticipate it so you're not caught off guard. Not *""whoa, wtf""*, but *""oh boy, here we go. How can I maneuver around this back to sexy-time?""*

-

 * **Example A**: I was at a college hitting on some milf going back to school. The vibe was happy, conversation was going good until she decided to talk about how her husband passed away... and talked about it for several sentences though I tried to change the subject. It wasn't appropriate based on the topics of discussion. 

-

* **Example B**: Claims to have been raped, abused, or molested in the past (especially when 'unprovoked'). 

-

Real rape and molesting victims usually feel great shame, often times not even sharing it with the family. If that really happened to her, do you think that would come up as a casual part of a conversation with some guy she doesn't know well? Especially in a causal manner? Never. This is some *#MeToo bullshit. All rape allegations should be assumed false until proven otherwise. Women have abused this too much. If she never filed a police report, don't take it seriously. 

-

**What to do**: For both of these examples, always pause for a second. ""Hmmm."" and maybe a ""that sucks"", then gradually change the subject. Never let something emotionally negative from a woman phase you. Often times it's bullshit or is insignificant. But do keep in mind women like to get the feelz running for feelz-sake. It's not a bug, it's a feature. It's a woman thing. No way around that. 

-

 * Side Note: If a girl starts talking about boring shit, remember getting up and walking away without warning is a viable option. Don't let women waste your time. Don't be a [time-ho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9QOQNcpuiA). 

 * Side Note 2: Opie and Anthony w/ Patrice O'Neal (only ones with Patrice), [CultofBlackPhillip](https://www.youtube.com/user/CultOfBlackPhillip/videos) (Patrice O'Neal), [Beige Phillip Show](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheBeigePhillip/videos) (Dante Nero, award winning male stripper)... Just listen to them on youtube. To you newbs, these two are TRP legendary.

65,Here's how to fuck one girl/week from swipe apps in 2018 with little time investment,1441,0,1441,7mbfl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7mbfl0/heres_how_to_fuck_one_girlweek_from_swipe_apps_in/,403,1514362259.0,"*Originally posted on [my blog](https://pancakemouse.wordpress.com/2017/12/26/how-to-fuck-one-girl-a-week-from-swipe-apps-with-little-time-investment).*

---

The new year is almost upon us, and that means online fucking apps (I refuse to call them online dating apps) will be in full force, filled with lonely women who just realized they were alone for the holidays. Blackdragon, the expert on this stuff, [notes that he gets 3x the results in January from apps as any other time of the year](http://www.blackdragonblog.com/2017/10/16/12-months-relate-dating-relationships/).

If you want to take advantage of this, here's what you should do:

**Prerequisites**

Fulfill at least half of the below requirements, roughly in order of importance:

* 5+/10 face (the most important factor; if you are below a 5/10 facially you should move to another country or try daygame)
* 5+/10 body
* White
* 5'9"" or over
* Decent style (e.g. new, well-fitted clothes, hair and facial grooming)
* Under age 35
* Live in a city of more than 150,000 people

If you are lacking in one or more of these factors, improve the controllables (e.g. lift, lose body fat, buy new clothes, get a haircut, move, etc.) and once you're ready, implement the below.

**Photos**

Assemble four to six photos of yourself of the below archetypes. These photos must not be selfies, and ideally should be taken with a DSLR by someone that knows what they're doing.

If you don't have these photos, talk to your photographer friend, or hire a photographer from Craigslist/Instagram. If you don't want to go this route, buy a cheap DSLR and a 50mm 1.8 lens from Craigslist, buy the cheapest tripod you can find on Amazon, buy a DSLR remote, and take the photos yourself.

The first bullet is required, you can pick and choose from the rest:

* Upper-body shot of just you. Ideally taken with a DSLR with you in focus with a blurred, interesting background, wearing nicely-styled clothes (a suit if you're over 25, a button-down or something else nice if you're under 25).
* You with a dog or some other sort of animal. Only do this if you actually like animals.
* You with a group of friends. You should be as tall or taller and as attractive or more attractive than every friend in the photo. All of your friends must be decently attractive and not low-status (i.e. if this photo was taken at an anime convention, you're toast).
* You doing [insert hobby here]. Snowboarding, DJing, skydiving, climbing, playing a high-status sport (sorry, Magic: The Gathering doesn't count).
* You in an exotic location.
* You doing something that indicates you're a leader of men. Holding a microphone, giving a speech, standing on stage, etc.
* A candid, shirtless photo (e.g. playing sports, on a beach). If you cannot bench your bodyweight and/or squat/deadlift 1.75x your bodyweight AND are less than 18% bodyfat, skip this. If you don't have a candid shirtless photo, a non-candid is OK, but you'll get worse results.

Once you have the photos, pick out 10-12 that you think are good and send them to three girls you've hooked up with in the past to get their advice on which to use. Close female friends are a decent secondary options. [Photofeeler ](https://www.photofeeler.com/)is a distant third.

**App Setup and Swiping**

*General App Setup*

1. Create a fake Gmail account.
2. Use the fake Gmail account to create a fake Facebook account with a photo of a male model and your real first and last name (you don't have to use your last name if you're not using Hinge). If you're 28-35 and want to fuck 18-22 year olds, put your age as 27. This has the added advantage of giving you a 50% discount on Tinder Plus, as we'll see later.
3. Go to a random page in the Philippines and add 500 random Filipinos until you have 100 Facebook friends. This is needed to bypass Facebook account verification for Tinder.

*Tinder*

1. Download Tinder and sign up with your fake email address.
2. Tap ""Get Tinder Plus"" and purchase Plus. If you're under 28, this should cost $9.95 a month. If you're 28 or over, this will set you back $19.95 a month.
3. Upload the photos you picked out in the photos section. Leave Smart Photos on.
4. Write a short, positive, non-needy bio that demonstrates higher value, e.g. ""Dog whisperer. World traveler, last three trips were to Bali, Australia, and New Zealand. Avid cook, I guarantee my bacon risotto is better than yours.""
5. Link your Instagram only if you have over 1000 followers and/or you have interesting photos that show a high-value lifestyle (e.g. travel, parties, friends).
6. Go to settings and set your distance range to the furthest range you think a girl would be willing to travel to meet you. [Use the Gmaps Radius tool to figure out what the radius of your surrounding area is](http://obeattie.github.io/gmaps-radius/?lat=-34.622441&lng=-58.423342&z=13&u=mi&r=10).
7. Set your age range to 18 at the low end and whatever the age of the oldest woman you'd have sex with is at the high end.
8. Go to [www.tind3r.com](http://www.tind3r.com) and set up the Chrome extension so you can swipe and message from your computer.
9. Start swiping with Tind3r. Your minimum for a right swipe would be a girl you'd have sex with if they were to come directly to your house with no monetary investment from you. [Do not swipe right on every girl, it brutalizes your private Tinder ""Elo score""](https://www.fastcompany.com/3054871/whats-your-tinder-score-inside-the-apps-internal-ranking-system).
10. Don't read bios or look at closely at photos or Instagrams. You should spend less than a second looking at each profile's photos before determining how to swipe. I can swipe about 75 girls a minute accurately with Tind3r and double that using my phone. This means, assuming 5000 girls are in your area, you should only need to waste about ten minutes a day swiping. 
11. Every day, use your 5 superlikes on girls you think are *just* out of your range. E.g. if you generally fuck 5s and 6s, use superlikes on 6.5s and the odd 7.
12. Swipe only during idle time, i.e. when you're on public transportation or on the toilet.
13. On Sunday between 8 and 10 AM, use your one free monthly Boost, which will put your profile at the top of every girl's stack in your area for 30 minutes. You don't have to swipe during this Boost, it doesn't have any effect on the matches you'll get.

*Bumble*

1. Download Bumble and sign up with your fake email address.
2. Upload the same photos and use the same bio as you did on Tinder. If you linked your Instagram on Tinder, mention it in your bio.
3. Use the same distance and age settings that you did on Tinder.
4. For Bumble, you're going to autoswipe. First, download [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/) on your computer. Edit AutoHotKey.ahk and paste the following in: https://pastebin.com/4XiZHpNd
5. Download [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/), an Android emulator. Run through the setup.
6. Download Bumble on your BlueStacks instance. Log in with your fake email address.
7. In the bottom right, click on the icon of the keyboard and map ""r"" to ""Swipe Up"" and ""g"" to Swipe Right.
8. While on the swipe screen, hit F7. Let the autoswiper run until you run out of profiles to swipe on (you won't be able to use your computer while you do this, so use a different computer or run it overnight).

*Hinge*

1. Download Hinge and sign in with your fake email address.
2. Use the same photos you did with Tinder, but remove any shirtless photos if they're not candid.
3. If you're under 5'10"", add an inch to your height.
4. If you have a medium to high-status job, list it.
5. If you went to college, list it.
6. Answer three of the questions in a witty, intellectual way. Use good grammar and proofread for spelling.
7. Start viewing profiles. Never like any of the photos of the girls, but rather their questions directly (shows interest in their ""mind"" rather than their appearance).
8. Don't waste your time leaving a comment with your like unless you have something interesting to say (e.g. if she says she wants to go to Ecuador on her bucket list, mention that you just got back from there).

*Coffee Meets Bagel*

1. Download Coffee Meets Bagel and sign in with your fake email address.
2. Use the same photos you did with Hinge.
3. Follow the same Hinge guidelines about height, job and education.
4. Use the same questions you answered for Hinge but warp the answers to fit Coffee Meets Bagel's scheme for ""I am..."", ""I like..."" and ""I appreciate when my date...""
5. Go to suggested and like all the Bagels you'd have sex with.
6. Go to discovery and like girls until you run out of beans.
7. Repeat this process every day at noon (when your bagels have been replenished).

*Happn*

1. Download Happn and sign in with your fake email address.
2. Use the same photos and bio you did with Tinder. If you linked your Instagram to Tinder, link it here as well.
3. If you never leave your house, sign out of Happn on your phone and sign into Happn on BlueStacks. Use the BlueStacks location feature to change your location to where hot girls live/work/hang out. Change your location once a day.

**App Messaging**

If you're playing this right, matches should be rolling in on all of your apps. You're going to use the exact same openers and messaging format for every app.

1. Open a girl with a non-needy, *unique *opener (I'm not going to post examples here, because if I do they'll start getting used and not be unique anymore). The opener should ideally assume something about her and end in a question mark, but doesn't have to.
2. Gauge her response, and write back, using less text than her. If she hasn't asked you a question (what I call the *hook point*), provide some information, like a DHV about yourself, and ask her another question.
3. If she's asking you questions back, you have a green light. Respond something like ""That sounds cool, we should grab a drink. I'm free [x] or [y] day, let me know what works for you."" Based on her response, tell her where and when to meet you.
4. If she's not asking you questions back, you have a yellow light. Keep DHVing and teasing her for a few more lines until you get her to invest. If she's not investing but still responding, hit her with the date pitch after a maximum of five messages from each of you.
5. If she's being combative, you have a red light. Stay non-reactive and playful. Keep DHVing and teasing her until you have a yellow or a green light, at which point you should pitch the date.

Other tips:

* Ignore any rules about waiting a certain amount of time to text back. The minute you match with a girl, you are already fighting a losing battle against her attention. Reply back as soon as possible and keep her engaged.
* If a girl stops responding, wait 2-3 days (at *least*) and hit her back with a funny respawn text teasing her for disappearing. I'm not going to post mine, but if she's riding a horse in her profile, here's a mediocre example: "", did you fall off your horse and die? Let me know where I should send flowers."" Do this twice, and wait 2-3 days between each message. If she doesn't respond, leave her and work another girl.
* Burn every lead to the ground. You should be messaging and scheduling dates with *every* girl you match with in order to cultivate abundance.

If you want examples, I recommend the breakdowns on [Playing with Fire](https://www.playingfire.com/category/lay-reports/). He's the only guy I know that provides full screenshots of all his messages from opener to sex (keep in mind, however, that he is above average looks and runs shirtless photo + explicit bio game. If you're average, you can't expect these results, but his messaging is good).

**Weekly Routine**

The above will cover you for the first week. After that, you'll notice that your matches are going to fall off. This is because Tinder and Bumble give newbies an early boost to get their profiles shown to more people. So every Sunday night, here's what you're going to do:

1. Create a *new* fake Gmail account and Facebook event, and add 100 friends again.
2. Go into your Bumble and Tinder accounts associated with your old fake email and hide the profiles to the public. This will make it so you can still chat with your old matches, but won't have two profiles up at once.
3. Create new Bumble and Tinder accounts. Follow the exact same methods as you did last week regarding using your Tinder Boost and autoswiping on Bumble, but tweak your photos/bio using feedback from the last week.

It should take less than an hour to do this each week, but you'll get 50% more matches, not only with the newbie boost, but also because you'll be shown to different girls each week due to the random nature of Tinder.

**Results**

Number of matches per week is going to completely depend on physical attractiveness and quality of profile, as well as your sexual market value in your city compared to the male competition on the apps.

Here are my average weekly results as an average-looking guy in San Francisco, the hardest city in the United States for average guys:

* 52 matches (30 from Tinder, 7 messages from Bumble, 13 from Hinge, 1 from CoffeeMeetsBagel, 1 from Happn)
* 36 matches worth opening (rest were errant swipes or I had buyers remorse)
* 17 matches reply
* 5 matches schedule a date
* 2 matches actually show up to the date (the rest flake or logistics don't work)

Two dates a week is on the low end for cultivating abundance, so if you're getting worse results than this, something is wrong. You need to improve your sexual market value, photos, openers, or messaging.

It's impossible to provide generic troubleshooting steps because every guy will have different problems, but if you post a comment here or PM me on reddit, I'm happy to help.

Finally, you'll notice I didn't provide any information for what to actually do on a date. That's because this has been written about extensively by other guys. I recommend [Blackdragon](http://www.blackdragonblog.com/) or [JMULV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF4WvgHQtcypvg5fPTog-Yg) for more on that.

The interesting details is that both Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan used language and terminology that we use here! 

I had suspected for a long time that both Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson have deep knowledge of gender/sexual interactions from a Red Pill view. Red Pill theory convinced me a few months ago, but hearing a Harvard educated psychologist talk about it was refreshing. Kinda makes you wonder how many of these academics have deep insight that they never share due to political corretcness.


Anyways - They start talking about Red Pill theory around 1:32:00. They start talking about “enforced monogamy”, rejection, incels, alfa bucks/beta bucks, sexual marketplace place on college campuses and then dwell into other Red Pill theory.

Because—if you put this quote into practice—any character trait you wish to possess is within your reach. 

The great psychologist, William James, said, **“If you want a quality, first act as if you already had it.”**

Your self beliefs have a huge effect on your thoughts and actions. However, your actions also have a huge effect on your self beliefs.

Therefore—by drastically changing our actions—you can drastically change your beliefs.

**“The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can change the outer aspects of their lives, by changing the inner attitudes of their minds.”** - William James

That is to say—to be confident—you must start acting and thinking like a confident person.

To be productive, you must start acting and thinking like a go-getter. 

When your actions and thoughts align with how you want to see yourself, you will begin to believe you are that person. Your subconscious mind will automatically assume that since you are behaving a certain way, you must be that type of person.

**""As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives.""** - Henry David Thoreau

>> Not at all. My wife took our baby when she dyed her hair blue and fell in with a crowd of regs feminists that work with her at Starbucks. She moved back in with her mom, stopped working, and hit me up for child support. They set my CS at the highest earnings I've ever made in my life - a single month during my time owning a janitorial business - , pre tax, 40%. So, that one single month (I had got a contract to clean up a demolished building that paid $4000), I made $6000. Luckily, in Texas, there's a cap at a little over $1000 a month. Problem is, I make $600 every two weeks.

>> I didn't cheat. I didn't flake. I was supportive, loving, and if I might say so, a good husband. She cheated on me while pregnant with our child, took off while I was at work, no notice, and filed a restraining order which I later found out all lawyers MUST advise their clients of, because it means a MUCH higher rate of achieving custody. That shows up on my background check.

>> I'm genuinely going to kill myself soon, because I have about two months of savings left with which I can pay my CS, and after that, for each payment missed, it's a court date, with a 180 day jail sentence. Why did all of this happen? So she could find herself. Because she's a strong independent waman who don't need no man. <--- that sentence would have never, ever come out of me before she left.

>> That's not the half of it, either. I won't bore you with details, but just a few highlights are:

>> Legal Aid place said their free help for poor people was ""more for women"".

>> The state provides free attorneys for women but not men in custody and CS cases.

>> 95% of all custody cases are awarded to women in my state.

>> This one's the worst of them all, to me: After all of this, I am, in most of society's eyes, a deadbeat dad.

>> No, this one's the worst: They arbitrated CS from out of state for my wife, so she didn't even have to show up to the court date, but they won't do that for custody. I still haven't even seen my daughter. I learned her name (went from a classic ""Julia"" to ""Aaliahya""..) when the policewoman served me CS papers and treated me like I was trash.

>> My wife, unemployed, living with mom, gets nothing but help and positivity and support. I'm a monster.

>> So, that's the story of how I die, apparently.

>> EDIT: wwell fuck I'm sitting here crying for the first time in.. I don't know.. I can't begin to tell you guys all how much this means to me. I've been living with this huge knot in my chest for close to 2 years and haven't told a soul because I was sure they'd call me weak or not a man or whatever I thought. Just thank you. Thank you thank you thank you, all of you, so much. I promise this to each and every one of you guys: I will document this all. I will make a video detailing all of this, and I'll try to get in contact with some of the people which some of you guys have told me would be interested in the story. I'll plea my case in court before I commit to anything, and like one guy said, maybe jail isn't that bad. 

Still wanna get married? 

Still wanna bet ""your life and everything in it"" on the turn of a card in order to win ""she gets a ring and a princess party, and you keep the relationship you have now""?

69,Swedens Liberal Youth Party suggests men should be able to denounce fatherhood for as long as women can have an abortion,1420,0,1420,48wx66,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/48wx66/swedens_liberal_youth_party_suggests_men_should/,287,1457118841.0,"**Link to article:** http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article22380686.ab

(I think the newspaper is protecting its article against search-enginges so google refuses to translate it for me, translate it manually if you're really interested)

**Summary:** So youth-part of the Liberals suggests men should have the same option to opt out of a pregnancy as a woman

**Body:** The idea is that men should be able to reject parenthood up untill the 18th week (for as long as women can have an abortion without special circumstances). 

Note that this is most likely mostly to get attention as the same party suggested that necrophilia and incest should be legalized a few weeks back. Still the motion put the ""equality"" principle to a test and shines some light on the fact that men have next to no power when it comes to deciding if they want to become a parent or not (wrap it up boys and dont let anyone close to your condoms).

He also points out that this would obviously be an irreversible decision, so you wouldnt be able to change your mind once your kid is successful.

To me this is a very sound and logical idea and the fact that it plays into the ""gender-equality"" ideal makes it even harder for feminist to try to denounce it. Im obviously not naive enough to believe they wont try.

So what's your opinion, do you believe it could work?

Would less women go through with their unexpected pregnancies if they knew they couldnt use their babies as pay-checks?

71,Frame for Dummies. What it is and ways to build (and keep) it.,1411,0,1411,7vz5y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7vz5y8/frame_for_dummies_what_it_is_and_ways_to_build/,238,1518064323.0,"""Frame is everything. Always be aware of the subconscious balance of whose frame in which you are operating. Always control the Frame, but resist giving the impression that you are."" - Rollo Tomassi, Iron Rule #1

Frame can't really be faked. And if you do fake it, it won't take long before women will poke holes in it. That's what they are meant to do.

Luckily, frame is directly related to your own personal value and belief system. So it doesn't actually take that much to alter. Even a low SMV man with a strong frame *can* work like magic on women (think of convicts and junkie musicians)

Here are the most important points to internalize and actually change your attitude to believe. If you truly make these points real in your mind, gaming will get easy for you.

1. You're better than her. (In every way except maybe taking care of a child)

2. She's there for YOUR entertainment. (Treat her like a servant and ask her to do favors for you)

3. She stopped maturing at 18. (Treat/tease her like a child.)

4. She's a nasty dirty cumguzzling whore for **the right guy.** ALL girls are very sexual. (Don't fear sexual implication, you're a man, it's natural and masculine)

5. You're more willing to walk away than her. Women need to feel that you do not need them. (Outcome Independence. This one is key. DO NOT be more invested than her.)

6. There's NOTHING that she can do to make you emotional and reactive. (Women should be literally incapable of getting under your skin. Nothing phases you. You've seen it all before and it's laughable when they try their mindfuck games)

7. Its her loss if you're hard rejected. You were simply trying to share some of your awesomeness with the world instead of being a selfish asshole and hogging it all to yourself. (Never forget that when you approach, you're OFFERING value to a girl, not LEECHING it. You're doing them a favor.)

8. Recognize knowledge of improvement. (No matter what happens, you're improving your approach and results in the future. Always. There's no such thing as going backwards in skill on approaches)

9. Failure is fun and embrace it (you should approach 9's and 10's to get shut down and learn the difference of their tests to get better).

10. You take/work for what you want. (See hot girl. Want to put dick in. Take steps to see if that's an option to get the desired result you want)

11. Walk and act like you have two french 10's that lick caviar off your balls as soon as you walk through the door every fucking day. (Ignore her beauty, you're used to smokeshows already. They're just girls..)

12. Sex is on your mind and your actions reflect it. (You should be undressing her with your eyes, spanking her/grabbing her ass every chance you get, escalating often, and whispering dirty things you want to do to her in her ear, grabbing her thigh when you're driving, etc. Be the fun sex guy. Leave ""Billy Beta"" in the fucking past)

13. You're the leader. (She follows you. YOU make the decisions, you call the shots, you design the plans. She's just along for the ride.)

14. Her moral recklessness and emotional rollercoaster riding is adorable to you. You've read briffault's law and you know WHAT they are, (not necessarily WHO they are.) You enjoy their fragility and savageness in the same breath.

15. Confidence and boldness is your default. (Walk like Brad Pitt, talk like George Cloony, fuck like Tyler Durden, and lift like Dwayne Johnson)

She's also one of the first to publicly accuse Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct.

This weekend, [The New York Times broke the story](http://archive.is/tB82x) that in 2013, Argento gave alcohol to a 17 year old actor and had sex with him.  The age of consent in California is 18.

The actor originally asked for $3.5 million, based on his income before the incident and its effect on his career.   According to documents sent to the Times via encrypted email, Ms. Argento, who is divorced and has two children, was both a mentor and a mother figure to Mr. Bennett, and the two were intermittently in contact as he grew up. “Jimmy’s impression of this situation was that a mother-son relationship had blossomed from their experience on set together”

---------------------

This development mirrors my own experience with the court system in California.  While women enjoy many advantages in society, including often getting a pass for behaviors that would land a man a nearly guaranteed prison sentence; if you do your due diligence and follow procedures to the letter, the justice system works well for men against women who have wronged them, too.

It serves as a good reminder of a few things;

-if you dont use a throwaway, i would consider it. These lunatics are the kind of people who will doxx you.

-don't talk about TRP outside of TRP. Regular people are not going to respond well to words such as ""hypergamy"" and ""alphas"". Nobody these days has any critical thinking skills. Everyone is emotionally incontinent and is likely to just call you a misogynist rather than listen to what you have to say.

-almost every other sub will give you flak for even mentioning TRP.

-if you want to talk about TRP concepts to a buddy then make sure he can be trusted. Don't talk about TRP to blue pilled betas.

-if you are still on the side bar material, DO NOT mention that you go on TRP to anyone, nor go spouting off about how you understand women.

-censorship becomes more and more likely each day. Speak the truth and stand up for it. In the UK this week, we had some head police officer (in a region badly affected by child rape gangs) say on radio and Twitter that police resources are being used to follow up NON CRIMINAL incidences of ""offensive"" speech.

A short story over business to business relations. If you are an entrepreneur or working towards being self employed, you need to read this post.

_______________________________________________

#Body

Let's say I had two friends, Tim and Kevin that both started separate businesses. Kevin goes and finds a single customer that will generate $1,000,000 in sales for the year. Tim goes out and find 20 customers, but each customer only generates about $50,000 dollars a year in sales.

Well let’s say I was Kevin's one customer.

 I call Kevin up and say, *”Sup bro, I got an order for you, i’ll send in the Purchase order for $100,000.”* Kevin’s ecstatic, holy shit he’s never seen so much money before in his life. He just started this business and is so excited that he landed such a lucrative contract. He spent the last 4 years going through college to get his business degree, he got married to a lovely girl, they had a kid so she decides to be a stay at home mom at least till he’s old enough for school. He’s been slaving away in corporate America for the past 8 years to pay for college and save up enough to finally start his own business. He’s got this shit on lock. He’s got the work ethic to make this deal happen and he’s going to crush it.

He takes out a mortgage on his home to front the startup loan from the bank. He heads out and buys all the materials needed to complete the job. It end up costing him $60,000 grand to complete the job, 40k isn’t a bad profile margin. From the moment he buys his material from his vendors, he has 30 days to pay them back. That’s the default pay period when business to business transaction happen, usually called Net 30.

Kevin thinks he might be able to get a bit more money out of the work though. He contacts me and tells me he underestimated the quote and it’s going to be an extra 30k to complete. Kevin assumes I’ll understand as this is his first time and I’ve been mentoring him through his whole upstart.  I let him know that’s fine and we renew the purchase order for $130,000.

Now he’s going to make 70k profit! He doesn’t waste any time. From day 1 of him picking up materials he is off putting in the time, labor, sweat and tears to get this done. He’s going to make a killing. 

Kevin and I meet at a trade show last year through mutual interest and I saw the passion in his eyes to get shit done. I knew he had the hustle, he just need a push in the right direction and some incentive to get started. In this case, $1 million in sales a year is what I offered him.

Let's talk about me a little. I’m in my 50’s, been the president of a division of a billion dollar a year corporation for about 10 years now. Our division alone put out $230 million a year in sales. Our parent company that owns us reaches 1.6 billion a year. Kevin’s 1 million dollar account doesn’t even merit a second glance in the accounting office.

Back to Kevin. He finishes up his work. Spent all his material and the job is done. At 25 days since his first material purchase, he still has just under a week to pay back his vendor at the Net 30. Not to worry, vendors know the game, sometimes it takes a bit to get the money before the last tier supplier get’s his check. He learned all this in business school.

He calls up the main office and gives my secratary the news. *”Great Mr Redwood is on vacation in the rockies for the week! When he gets back I’ll have him check out the work and you’ll be seeing the check in the mail within a few business days.”* Kevin’s ecstatic, his first big deal. He’s about to bank 70k profit in a month.

Week goes by and nothing. He calls but doesn’t reach me. The secretary tells him that I’ll be back by tomorrow to inspect the work first hand. Great, he’s had to dig into his savings a bit to pacify the vendor till the check comes in. No worries though, Kevin and I became good friends during this last year and he still has money back in the bank.

Two weeks go by and nothing, He can’t reach me as i never gave him my private cell. He calls the main office, secretary tells him that I checked it out, work was awesome and the check is in the mail. Great, he had to spend some more savings on some emergency medical issue with his kid but now he’s about to bank 70k. He’s dreaming about what this job will be like at the end of the year. The vacation he’s going to be able to treat his family too. Hell, imagine what this will be like in 2 or 3 years. Kevin is literally on cloud 9. The past 8 years has brought him to this moment.

3 weeks, nothing. He’s starting to worry. He’s out almost 60 days and his vendor is starting to send notices. He calls but nothing.

4 weeks past Net 30. same run around.

5 weeks out. still no check.

6 weeks, same.

7 weeks, same.

8, same.

9 weeks. Kevin files for bankruptcy. His vendors take him to court for the money he owes. All his assets, house, everything, seized by the banks. His wife can’t stand him. How could she marry such a loser. How could this have happened? Hell, this is illegal right?

It is absolutely, one hundred percent, positively illegal to do what i just did to Kevin. But good luck trying to take my $230 million dollar a year company to court while you are in the middle of filing for bankruptcy and have no other income source, Kevin. 

__________________________________________________________________

If you think this story is bullshit or this would never happen in modern day America, I can be assured that you’ve never ran a business longer than a few years. Or, you at least have the privilege of not working in my line of work. I’m 25, I’ve been doing what i do for 10 years, I’ve seen it happen twice. My father has seen it happen more time than he can count and so have many others that I have been mentored by. 

My father sat me down one day after he got a call from a company and he said, *""Clint, one day you are going to get a call from a customer or new company. They are going to offer you more money than you've ever seen before in your life. It will be like holding a winning lottery ticket in your hand. All the shit you can do with that amount of money will flash before you. It might be equal to or even dwarf our entire sales for the year. Everything in you will tell you to take that deal.*

*Don't ever take that deal.""*

A large corporation with tons of power goes out and finds some chump that’s eager and driven, they offer him a deal he can’t refuse, only to burn him, not pay, and there is shit he can do about it. They hold such an immense amount of power and influence over you that you can not possibly take them to court. They will drown you in legal bullshit and it will cost you more than you can imagine. 

Now, that 100k, that’s nothing. That’s like a week of sales for most small business. As in 5-50 employee sized businesses. I use 100k because to most ordinary people, that’s a lot of money. Oh, and that extra 30k Kevin thought he was getting out of me. Ha, whatever Kevin wants to hear is what Kevin will hear. I’m Kevin’s #1 sycophant, I’m the *”Yes”* man. 

In business, the more charming and the more enthusiastic a person is, the more you should be skeptical of them. It’s sometimes hard to identify a con man vs just some guy that’s really passionate/charismatic, that takes time and experience. But a good businessman weighs his options and never makes split decisions. A con man will tell you everything you want to hear without a second thought. If you want to know if you are getting conned, present them a serious issue that needs to be discussed, in this case a 30k quoting mistake. if it’s answered in a minute or less, you’ve got problems. 

Conmen talk from an emotionally drive narrative not logic. They will play off your vibes and how you react, not through logic or planned out thoughts. They will have a basic plan for the con, as in me offering a million for enticing Kevin. But their delivery is always rooted in emotional manipulation and getting you to shut down your logical thought process. If you feel emotion, happiness, sadness, anything when making a business deal. Stop, don't make a decision, calm yourself, leave if need be, hell take a week off if you have to. You must be grounded and level when you make giant decisions. Meditate if need be.

The company I saw get burned, they bought 1 million dollars in equipment and material to get a job from a very, VERY reputable corporation. You are probably imagining some slimball president of some shady corporation that could be morally and ethically relatable to Skynet if it was ran by Saul Goodman from Breaking Bad. 

You’d be dead wrong. 

This company that burnt them was a company every single one of you knows of. Hell, half of you probably own an appliance by them. I’ll just repeat that again though if it didn’t set in though. They spent $1,000,000 and didn’t get a dime, filed for bankruptcy a few months later. By a company that pretty much all of you know and trust to make good products.

Oh, and that company that got burnt for 1 million? Ya, that wasn’t some dude like Kevin. That was a company that was in business since the 80’s.


*“So what went wrong? Fuck, this is hella illegal!”* Doesn’t matter what is legal or illegal, it’s what you can get away with. You think laws stop people from doing things? Fuck no, we break laws all the time, the only thing that stops people fucking one another over is if they can get away with it or not.

Bullpill advice would be, take them to court, try to get your money out of them. It will be alright. We believe in you and we are here for you.*(random people on the internet that he probably tried to consolidate with or advice some friend gave him)*.

I’ll tell you right now that advice is worth less than the air and calories it took to say it. here’s the redpill advice. Kevin, you fucked up. You let your emotions and the alluring of dollar signs sway your decision making skills. You saw $1,000,000 written out and said, *”Holy shit, One million dollars, sign me up.”* You let emotion, lust and greed trump logic and planning. You saw a big shinny number, from a company you know and love, that everyone knows and loves, that’s been around forever and you took that as merit for them to be a trustworthy client. Instead of sitting down and looking ahead of what they could do to you if you accept their deal. You thought you were playing blackjack when they were playing chess. You made one move and thought you won the game and didn’t think anything past that. You broke the #1 golden rule of business.

#Never have all your eggs in one basket

Let's take a look back at Tim. I bet you forgot about Tim. In the amount of time Kevin went from 25k in the bank and owning a home to being homeless, Tim cleared 5 orders of 20k each, cost him 15k in materials each, resulting in 25k profit and 100K sales for the month. Good job Tim.

Why? because none of Tim’s customers have power over him. If I tried to pull the shit that I pulled on Kevin, Tim can fall back onto his other accounts to support his business and life style, and have the money to take me to court in the process. 

Tim, can’t be fucked with, because Tim has abundance.

#Lessons learned

This is just one rule of business that I’ve learned through the years being mentored by some truly alpha men. I never correlated it with abundance mentality till TRP though. But it is the #1 rule of business and it’s one they constantly drill into my head. The shit these men have shared with me and taught me is invaluable and stuff you can’t find in textbooks. It’s only learned through experience. Textbooks will teach you what to do if everyone plays by the rules. It won’t teach you a damn thing when it comes to playing the game with people that break the rules.

There is a lot of benefits to the golden rule than foreseeing getting fucked over. For instance it’s not always some dickbag trying to fuck you. Maybe one of your customers goes out of business just due to the economy. Trust me, they won’t tell you they are going under, a lot of times you won’t even know, their purchase orders will just stop coming in or they just go radio silent. If they were 25% of your business, you’ve got problems. You may not go under but you will be laying employees off or taking a pay cut yourself.

At our company we tried to make sure none of our customers gets above 10% of our sales for the year. 5-7% is the sweet zone. If you can manage that, no customer can fuck with you. you should track these number religiously, because trust me, your customers know how much money they pay you a year. And they will use that number to throw their weight around. If you don’t know your % then you don’t know what kind of negotiating power you have. Basic Sun Tzu teachings, *”Know yourself and know your enemy.”*

If rule # 1 is never have all your eggs in one basket, then #2 is never let your customer know how many baskets you have or how big their basket is*(also a Sun Tzu teaching)*. Customers will straight up ask you sometimes, *”How much of our work is your business.”* If they are above 10%, your answer to that question is always, *”I have no idea off the top of my head, I’d have to speak with my accountant on that.”*. They can’t use what they don’t know against you. If it’s below 10%, you tell them exactly what their % is so they know they can’t fuck with you. 

Basic misdirection and power play.

If a customer is over 25% of your business, you should be sweating bullets every day, you should be losing sleep and pulling your fucking hair out. You should not be eating till you secure another account and drop that 25% to 10%. At my company we have dynamic employees, we don’t have dedicated sales reps as sometimes sales are not what we need. When customers hit 15-20%, sales reps head out the door looking for new work or we contact current customers for more work to level the playing field. Growing horizontally is always better than vertically. This is also why consumer goods are great to get into, then you literally have thousands of customers that don’t even equate to 0.1% of your sales. No one owns you and no one can bully you.

If a customer knows they are 35%+ of your work, I don't give a shit who's name is on the sign out front. I don't care who or how many people own shares of your company. If a company is 35%+ of your total work, they now own your business. They just may or may not know it yet. This the most important thing I can ever teach you about business. You become a slave to your customer the moment you are not in a position of Fuck You.

76,"Hamster pushed for divorce, then became jealous when ex-husband got in shape and found a younger, prettier SO",1389,0,1389,8e4vth,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8e4vth/hamster_pushed_for_divorce_then_became_jealous/,250,1524448286.0,"Reading relationships subreddit can bring some good TRP examples IRL.

[Here's the thread](http://archive.is/Fdi6w).

Characters in the story: the hamster (32F), her ex-husband (33M) and his new girlfriend (26F).


Husband focused on career, while wife stayed at home caring for his son. She had no hobbies nor friends, was overweight and became less attractive as she hit the wall, and being home alone, she was feeling lonely (probably cheated on her husband occasionally) while husband was working his ass off to provide for family.

The husband stayed faithful, yet to her that wasn't perfect, she wanted him to leave his job(?) to spend more time with her, yet had the husband did so, she'd have left him after a while because he'd no longer be providing her and their kid with quality life, and would have turned into a loser just like she is.

Instead of appreciating the quality life and supporting husband in his career, she gave him drama and **initiated** the divorce.

Hooked the husband on child support (she wouldn't mention facts like this, because that's not good for her self-image) was banging random dudes she'd have found online (very easy for a woman to get laid and get that instant gratification from attention/sex), then after realizing she lost a man with very high SMV, and there are slim chances of getting another one now, she regretted her decision and wants him back.


But unfortunately for her, the husband moved on, found himself a pretty, fit 26 y/o girl with a positive attitude.

Had the husband became miserable and turned into a loser alcoholic, she wouldn't have wanted him back, and rationalized her decision to divorce him as ""right"".

Remember, women will rationalize whatever they want so long as it benefits them.

In this case, she became the victim of her own stupidity. If you're at a point in life, when your SO gives you shit/or your wife divorces you, with little care to your ""feelings"". Just remember, that the best revenge is to get more successful than you currently are, get higher SMV, nothing grinds hamster wheels harder than seeing the man they dumped becoming a better person in the future.

It’s Saturday night, we’re celebrating a friends birthday party, I’m with my boys, older brother and his friends having a great time by the bar, holding court and trading war stories. 

Then:

“ Fuck!! these fat bitches! The nerve! Why is she looking at me.“... 


“ Is she really trying to get with me? who does she think I am?” 

Proclaimed one of my brothers friends, A red pill man by many standards, 28YO in shape, working in finance with a six figure salary and a small real estate portfolio on the side. 

As we looked over to the source of his contempt, we observed a scene primarily reserved for the National Geographic. A herd of what couldn’t only be described as post wall or on the verge of it, very slutty dressed hippopotamuses.

After a few minutes of furious laughter at his frustration and her attempts to open my friend. it settled in on me. This expression, as comedic as it was, actually had a lot of symbolism to it - other than the fact that fat women are not attracted to fat men - ironically 

If as a human being, I cannot even do the bare minimum to take care of my body, why should anyone be attracted to me ? what have I done to attract that beautiful girl who works out everyday and plans her meals ? 

See, he was frustrated because he has worked hard to improve himself, to shape himself into the masculine man and being approached by a woman who could not even control what she put into her mouth, thinking that she was worthy of him, was taken as an insult. 

As women are insulted by the advances of beta males, so are men ( * who know what they deserve ) by fat women 

Society has taught us to “ accept people as they are” and to be “ just be yourself “. This as I have come to learn from this community, is self destructive at best. 

Lesson: Work hard and know what you deserve, and if anyone offers you less, don’t be afraid to tell them to fuck off ",2018-03-26 01:40:53
78,Dirty Sheets,1381,0,1381,3axfye,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3axfye/dirty_sheets/,371,1435160009.0,"**TL;DR:** Some people can never get enough.

I spent a wonderful three day weekend with my girlfriend of five months.  We've been monogamous since March.  I'm in my early 40s, divorced dad.  She is a 33 year old career girl, no kids, never married. We're both attractive, physically fit, and have very high sex drives.  

We spent most the weekend at my place.  We had sex three times on Friday, four on Saturday, and twice more on Sunday. She orgasms quickly and repeatedly.  She comes so often that one orgasm will blur into the next.  Impossible to count how many times I got her off.

The weather was perfect. In between lovemaking, we ate great meals, watched some Netflix, spent our afternoons laying by the pool, and nights soaking in the hot tub.  It was an amazingly relaxing weekend that we both needed.  She had a great time.  Sunday evening, she snuggled up close.  ""This weekend has been so perfect, I don't want it to end!""  But we both had to work in the morning, so eventually she had to head home.

All day Monday, she sent me text after text.  Sweet and sexual.  Very flirtatious.  ""When will I see you again?""  I replied that I had to get caught up on stuff, but I might be able to stop by for a short visit tomorrow after work.  ""Perfect! I need more of you!""

I spent Monday night doing housework and other chores.  I had an empty fridge, dirty dishes and laundry from the weekend.  She texted me steadily throughout the night.  Same all day Tuesday. ""I can't wait to see you!"" 

I left the office and arrived at her house right as she was pulling in the drive.  She walked over and greeted me with a passionate kiss on the sidewalk.  We went inside.

We talked for a few minutes and I fixed us a couple drinks. She excused herself to use the restroom.  I needed to pee too.  Rather than wait for her, I chose to use the toilet in the master bath upstairs.  I carried the drinks to her bedroom.  I had limited time, and we'd be heading there soon anyway.  I walk by her bed and immediately notice a dried cum stain in the center of the sheets.

What the fuck?

I haven't been here in a week.

Holy shit.

I go take a piss. Thoughts are racing through my head.  What should I do?  Should I call her out?  Demand an explanation? Or just quietly leave? One thing is certain: I'm done with her.  She cheated.  It is over.

When I come out, she's pulling the sheets off the bed.  Very nonchalantly, she says, ""The cat was on the bed, let me change the sheets.  She's shedding like crazy.""

Equally emotionless, I comment that with the warmer weather, she needs to brush the cat more often.  I help her put on the new sheets, and we immediately start having sex.  Afterwards she snuggles up to me.

She purrs in my ear.  ""You've been fucking me so much, I've been raw for days.""  She claims she has been unable to focus at work, thinking of me so often.

I give her a squeeze, then remind her I need to take off.  We dress and she walks me out.  One last kiss in the door and I drive away.

She texts me later that night.  I do not reply.

The next day, she texts me: ""Good morning, sexy!""  A few more texts follow, roughly one per hour.  I don't answer any of them.  Around lunchtime she asks, ""Is everything OK?""  I tell her we'll talk after work.

I call her up.  She asks if I'm upset.  I calmly respond, ""Of course.  You slept with some other guy.""  She denies it.  I tell her I saw the sheet.  She goes quiet, then tries to claim it was me, from the previous week.  I tell her to stop lying.

I maintained an emotionless and calm tone throughout the entire conversation.  I'll spare you the drawn out trickle truth.  It took 10 minutes to get the full story.  There wasn't much to it:

After our long weekend of sex, while texting me all day and night Monday, she had also messaged a friend to buy $20 worth of weed.  They smoked a bowl and had sex.  The end.

I've met this guy.  Hell, I've bought weed from him too.  He's the stereotypical loser pothead.  Nice enough guy, but he's pudgy, and has no ambition. An out of shape nobody with a dead-end job.  But she was horny and he was there.  Her pussy was raw and swollen.  She wanted dick. He had dick.

""I don't even like him!"" she protested.  ""It didn't mean anything.  I wanted you, but you weren't there!""

I told her we were done.  She was a free woman and could do what she liked, but I wasn't going to see her again.  She cried and begged forgiveness.  I calmly said good night and hung up.

She called me back, I didn't answer.  She texted me, begging to talk.  I blocked her number.  Removed her from Facebook.  Deleted her from my phone.  Two days later, a mutual friend (more hers than mine) asked what happened.  I simply told her we parted amicably.  We had moved on.

It's been two weeks now with no further contact.  There's very little overlap in our social circles.  We're both career-minded professionals.  I don't expect any stupidity.

Some of you may be wondering why I chose to fuck her that final time.  Mere minutes after removing the cum stained sheet from a bed where she had fucked some other guy maybe 20 hours prior. Why didn't I lose my shit and call her a whore? Don't I have any masculine pride? Sure.  But I just didn't care.  In the time it took me to take a piss, I had already written her off.  This was one final bang with an ex.  She just didn't know she was my ""ex"" yet.

**Lessons learned:** Nothing I didn't already know.  Pure TRP fundamentals.

Good sex is not enough to make a woman faithful.  They have free and unlimited access to dick.  If she wants it, she can get it. She was horny for me, but I wasn't there.  

I gave her commitment and emotional validation as well.  It still wasn't enough.  She's an older woman (33) with many past sexual partners.  While she may have loved the way I made her feel, sexually and emotionally, both have far less value with experienced woman.  The more partners a woman has had, the weaker the pair bonding.  Even my best was not enough to maintain her loyalty.

Did you notice the unspoken implication? It was my fault she cheated.  She wanted me, but I wasn't there.  Clearly, I screwed up by not being available to bang her a fourth day in a row... ;)  It is never their fault.

When you break up with a girl, do it calmly and without emotion.  Don't make a scene. Don't give her drama as a parting gift.  They crave that emotional climax. A big finale. Don't sacrifice your frame/dignity just so she can have her closure.

Know what you want.  I was not in love.  I was never looking for a LTR.  I don't have time to spin plates, so I prefer short-term relationships.  All I ever wanted was 6 months of companionship and good sex.  I'm not going to cry because I only got 5. She was my spring fling, nothing more. Spring is over and she is gone.  Time to find her replacement.

Some women hit the Wall softly. Even at 33, she's still fit and attractive.  She'll find another guy.  Probably quicker than I'll find the next girl.  Doesn't matter, it isn't a competition.  Maybe she'll land a BB husband.  Or maybe she'll end up alone with her cat.  I don't care either way.  This is the way of the world.  No point getting upset.  It is what it is.",2015-06-24 15:33:29
79,"No, Plastics Are Not Lowering Your Testosterone Levels - Real Science Explained Inside",1370,0,1370,6yt1ak,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6yt1ak/no_plastics_are_not_lowering_your_testosterone/,236,1504880189.0,"**This post is in response to another community member's post that essentially amounts to fear mongering over the use of plastics. The fact that almost no one in the comments, including multiple ECs, questioned the validity of the linked literature is worrying, and illustrates the need for a quick run-down of scientific skepticism.**

First off, let me say that bringing up topics like estrogen-mimicking plasticizers is completely valid and important. However, stating that ""plastics are the tobacco of the 21st century"" without a wealth of credible primary literature is absurd and akin to stating that ""water is a chemical in weed-killer so it must be bad for you"". 

**Why you should trust my judgement:** I am a molecular biologist and immunologist who is active in the academic sphere and have expertise in *in vitro* cellular assays. This is a fancy way of saying that I grow lots of cells in plastic dishes and then look at them in different ways, and it's how most of these studies are conducted. Also, it's my job to evaluate academic literature.

**Ok let's do this I'll try to make it as entertaining as possible.**

____________________________________________________________________
**Polymer Chemistry - also known as REEEEEEEEEEEEE**

As mentioned in the original article, some specific types of plastic polymer are embedded with *plasticizers* - essentially molecules added to the polymer matrix to change the physical properties of the material. Now most plastics are really just long carbon chains arranged horizontally with some interlinking vertical bonds, kind of like a the lines on a sheet of paper. Plasticizers insert themselves in the spaces between the lines and push them apart, making the material more flexible. 

Knowing that there are many types of plastic and many ways of making each type you might ask - ""well what kind of plastics should I watch out for? Am I really being dosed by 'big tampon' with endocrine disruptors until I get a period so they can make even more money?"" Well big tampon may be trying, but substances recognized as harmful by the primary literature are really only commonly found in the following materials:

1. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
2. Nitrile (like the rubber gloves your doctor wears for your weekly prostate exam)
3. Polyesters (this is more of a class of plastics)

Now keep in mind that polymer chemistry is really a black magic in itself and nothing is as simple as, ""yes this water bottle will give you bitch tits"" or ""no this prostate stimulator will not - unless you stick it in your mouth"". So instead of going through a list of plastics, of which there are many, and their production methods let's just get to refuting the literature linked in the OP. If you're *dying* to talk physical chem you can contact me and we can both pretend like we know what's going on after reading wikipedia.
___________________________________________________________________
**Das Swedish Study**
-
The first claim the article makes is that a Swedish study (n=200) found a correlation between maternal phthalate levels and ""anogenital distance"" - that's the distance from the anus to the genitals (commonly referred to as the scrote or undercarriage) after 20 months of life. 

First of all, you have to go on a wild goose chase to even understand why anogenital distance was used. It's actually a method of measuring reproductive toxicity as the trait is under androgen-receptor control. *However*, this method is really only used in animal studies and is not commonly applied to humans. Secondly, looking at Table 5 as presented in the study, the researchers present a model of confidence intervals that are not even close to significant. Not only that, but the article provides no evidence that (1) the pthalates in the maternal urine samples measured were from incidental ingestion of plasticizers or that (2) the correlation between maternal pthalate levels and scrote length has anything to do with the correlation between you drinking water out of a microwaved bottle and your dick shrinking up into an infinitesimally dense and small point, birthing a black hole. 

**This study is completely irrelevant to the original posters point.**

**Study #2: The Mysterious Case of Shitty Workers' Rights in China**
-

Luckily I didn't even have to waste my time reading deciphering jargon and ugly figures this time around because this isn't even a research paper. It's a huffington post article **that literally says half way down the page, ""This data should not raise alarm bells for men who don’t work in chemical factories"".**

The study the article sites was looking at levels of free testosterone in men who worked in a plastic factory in China- now this may be news to some of you guys but working in a Chinese plastic factory with no OSHA to save you is quite a bit different than drinking from a water bottle. And don't worry, we will get to the water bottle data soon enough.

**Study #3: Estrogen-dependent proliferation of MCF7 Cells, or, 18 bottles of bitch tits on the wall**
-

This study is the closest thing linked to actually being somewhat valid. In this study an assay is carried out where MCF7 cells are essentially treated with tap water where the solids in it have been concentrated way down from 1.5L to a few mL. For those who don't like commie units that means whatever is in that water is 1500x more concentrated than in your tap water. 

Anyway, so to 1500 MCF7 cells is added all the different water ""extracts"" (this is a highly simplified explanation) and a week or so later they look at the proliferation of the cells. What the hell, you may be asking? Why would you even measure the proliferation of these cells in response to water? Well, as it turns out, MCF7 is an immortal breast cancer cell line that expresses high levels of estrogen receptors and proliferates in response to activation of those receptors. Now if you scroll down to the results you can see that **WOAH**, the relative proliferation increased almost 80% when the evil dire-aids bottled water was used (but only sometimes when DMSO or dimethylsulfoxide is used as a solvent, which could very well be significant because DMSO makes anything dissolved in it pass through cellular membranes)! Big tampon strikes again boys. **But wait... Lets think about this for a second.**

This is an assay carried out in a cell culture dish on a cancerous immortal cell line. Now I have a lot of experience with cancerous cell lines, I work with them every day, and I can tell you that these aren't normal cells. Cancerous cell lines are the kind of thing that you can look at the wrong way and they start dividing- it's literally cancer my dudes. Not only that, but the estrogenic activity is only even significant when DMSO is included (although highly diluted), and the water is ""concentrated"" (look up solid phase extraction if you want in-detail info on this process it's actually fascinating) in a specific way! 

Even if we put all of these potential flaws of methodology aside we can see in the results section that the relative estrogenic activity is equal to that of 1-12 **picrograms (pg) per liter.** For reference, a picogram is 1x10^-12 grams. Putting this in perspective, a liter of water from Tampon-Corp has a truly devestating mass of 0.0000000018% the mass of a single grain of fucking sand. Guys. Oh, and that relative increase in proliferation was all that with just 1500 cells (avg. human has upwards of 15 trillion, or 15x10^12 cells or 10 factors of 10 more).

___________________________________________________________________
**Conclusions**

Now, my dudes. I understand that not everybody can be or wants to be a scientist. If you don't have first-hand experience working with cells and these kinds of methodologies, there would be no possible way to even read through some of these articles (the first one in particular is grueling as hell). **However**, we all have a responsibility to think critically about what we're reading instead of jumping to the conclusion that the government wants to cuck you. Think about it, if plastics were a government conspiracy like some of you apparently think, why would they use them on their own fucking armed forces?!

Next time you read something that tells you you're going to get dire-vagina-period-out-your-dickhole, use the following process to assess the evidence:

1. Look at the model organism in the study. How close is it to human? In scale? Genetically? Is it cancerous? In these cases, rodent models would have been far superior to established cancer cell lines in my opinion.

2. Read the results section first, the introduction second, and the methods last. Look at the figures, do they look right? Are they clear?

3. Where is this info coming from? HuffPo? Or is it a legitimate scientific journal. Is it in all Chinese?

4. Make sure that anyone who disagrees with your uninformed opinions is called a shill, as this argument has been passed down through the ages.

Anyways, my dudes, you're not going to grow bitch tits because you drink out of a water bottle. Is it possible there could be picogram levels of estrogen-mimicking molecules in your water? Yup. But guess what, there's probably about 100x more cockroach jizz in everything you eat, because a picrogram is literally such a small amount that I can't even describe it without scientific notation. So sack up and read the primary literature so you don't look like a dumb ass.

Thanks for reading. Mistakes in this article are a result of late-night writing.

**UPDATE:** Many community members have been asking me to provide scientific context to related issues such as steroid use and aluminum in deodorant. 

I'm happy to see this kind of curiosity but can't address all of the questions. I've decided to make a series of posts where I will review the literature on a specific topic from both sides in plain speak, as well as demonstrate how to assess the literature without having to have 3 degrees. A huge problem with academia is the jargon that locks the public out of the discussion, and the shoddy quality science ""reporting"" that makes it to the public. Let's do something about that.

You can vote for the first topic we will address together, or select other and send me a private message with your suggestion.

Thank you all and I look forward to continued learning within this unique community.

80,"Domineering, Manipulative Female Coworker was Trying to Edge me Out by Flirting and Ingratiating with Boss. I Capitalized on Boss's Horniness to Get Rid of Her",1364,0,1364,7v58i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7v58i0/domineering_manipulative_female_coworker_was/,197,1517754876.0,"The sub-department I now oversee and my department as a whole are sausage fests. One of my direct reports has been taking advantage of this (even before I came into this role) to basically create a Smurfette effect. She was the second draft pick for the position I got moved into and only lost by a hair. Keep in mind that this is after I saved the company from a coworker's substantial fuckup and demonstrated competence. Meanwhile she's mediocre at her job at best. Crazy to see how far titties can get you. We'll call this woman Susan.

Needless to say she resents the fuck out of me. Thinks my job should be hers and even mentioned such to a former coworker and close friend of mine. Loose lips sink ships, right? She turned up her flirtatiousness ever since, specifically targeting my superior (who is on the executive management team). He's been falling for it hook, line, and sinker. He regards flirting with attractive females as a privilege of rank from what I can tell and, at one point, even had a ""talking to"" with me (doubtless prompted by this bitch) about her feelings and to be nice and blah blah blah.

Naturally, I decided about ten seconds into this conversation that her name should be taken off my phone directory and put onto an unemployment check.

I fabricated a line of analytical reasoning as to why a problem that had existed in the inventory systems of a foreign office (we'll say the German office) had to be addressed now. Someone would have to go to ""Germany"" for about three months (give or take) to fix it. My presence was required here to finish rolling out something that was mid-implementation. So Susan was the only option. Boss man was visibly upset. This was his spank tank material after all. Susan was thrilled. She ""Always loves to travel!""

Unfortunately for Susan, the work waiting for her in ""Germany"" was some of the shittiest, most grueling work in existence. And there was no way to avoid it without it being obvious that she had shirked. So she had to do it. That's irrelevant, but it helped me get through those months knowing that she was miserable.

As soon as she left, I set about finding ""temporary"" help as a replacement. This had been discussed as part of the plan. I quickly found a more than suitable candidate. She was perfect. She was younger than Susan. She was meek and compliant whereas Susan had been boisterous and dominant. She was humble. Most importantly, she was Asian. We will call her Hijun. I told her that the job was temp-to-perm. In a way this was dishonest. But, ultimately, it *was* truthful!

My boss, I knew for a fact, had a thing for Asians. He took to Hijun immediately. Like cancer takes to a prostate. And it just so happened that she was a very, *very* diligent employee as well. Her metrics were far better than Susan's ever were. I took note to mention her success publicly and praise her multiple times.

Fast forward three months and I call Hijun over after making sure Bossman is in his office (which is well within earshot). I tell her, quietly, that the three month period of her employment is ending because the person she replaced is due to come back from ""Germany"" in a week or two (Susan's project ran late because obviously it did). She doesn't understand. I said temp-to-perm, didn't I? Fortunately, I've nailed the ""earnest and surprised"" look. She begins to cry and I offer her a tissue.

On cue, bossman comes over and asks what's going on.

""Well, as you know, Susan is coming back and will be able to resume her duties... So...""

""Oh, right."" I can tell now that Susan had honestly slipped his mind after three months. He seems genuinely torn.

""Unfortunately, it seems there may have been some sort of... language barrier or miscommunication? Hijun was under the impression this would be permanent.""

""Oh, Jeese. That stinks."" Hamster spinning. ""But didn't you say that her numbers have been really good?""

I nod. Hijun is not crying but is still clearly distraught and sniffling. ""That's true. All of her metrics have been stellar. But unfortunately there's not enough work here for two positions.""

""Yeah... there must be something we can do, though.""

He wants an excuse at this point. I have one.

""Well, aren't they still looking to fill that position in accounts payable? Susan had a minor in accounting.""

This position has been filled and vacant on and off for years. Because the manager is an idiot who doesn't know what she wants. This position is a metaphorical toilet with the flushing power of Niagara falls that can dispose of even the largest pieces of human refuse. Namely, Susan. What's more, it is in an entirely different department. But big dick bossman can get her placed there if he wants.

""Hey! That's right!"" Ignores me, immediately turns to Hijun and begins to comfort her. ""Don't worry, Hijun. We've got it. You'll stay on and become permanent in this role and Susan will take a *different* role in the company. Okay?""

She's obviously still broken up a bit, but hopeful. She nods. His white knighting over, he turns back to me to deal with the reality of the decision he's just made. ""Is she still up, you think?""

""Well, it should be 3:40 in 'Germany' now. Do you want me to ask her if this is okay?""

""I'll tell her."" Bossman exits stage left. I let Hijun regain her composure, apologized for the confusion, and made sure to have her made permanent before Susan was back on the same continent. Susan is currently battling the atomic water pressure of the Accounts Payable toilet, Hijun is performing better than ever (she still thanks me sometimes), and bossman can jack off to this nice girl who is not qualified for and has no interest in my position.",2018-02-04 14:34:36
81,The 13 Dont's of Gaming,1360,0,1360,8ajkgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8ajkgy/the_13_donts_of_gaming/,212,1523150731.0,"*Edit: Added a few more details under each relevant point so it's as beginner friendly and coherent as possible. Essentially in any interaction concerning sexual intimacy, you should aim for a ""it just happened"" sort of thing, this works best by far*

This is my first ever post as a way of giving back to the community and reporting what I've learned and found what works best. You can check your strengths and weaknesses and know what to improve/how to cater your game, an example is I need to be less of a douchebag and not fail every comfort test that goes my way. This is my first and potentially only post on the sub so hopefully it provides valuable insight despite it being obvious and whatnot

*  **Never Shit Where You Eat**

Definition: Never sleep with a coworker/someone closely associated with your work. I believe girls in the same apartment are fine so long as you watch your back and stay safe, someone in one of your university classes too so long as you approach cautiously. Fellow gym members is a risk, only ever approach the ones that give you strong and plenty IOIs, don't approach the girls that don't. Ever. Basically don't sleep with someone you work often with/around or gym girls that focus on their own thing and don't want to be bothered

This one should be engraved into your mind. It's never worth it, don't fucking do it. It's strongly advised against for good reason. Mixing pleasure and business is not a good idea since she may cause drama or try and fuck you over on your job. Too many risks for the payoff to ever be worth it

* **Never Try Hard**

Definition of trying hard: Sexually escalating and trying it by moving too fast, attempting in short intervals and giving attention regularly. It's cool and all to be direct although if you just make it sex-based she won't cave. Trying hard at first is well paired up with getting yourself into a true ""don't give a fuck"" mood later on, they find that so so sexy, though it's very hard to get put into that mood. Only ever happened to me three times and no clue what caused it

From a post I read before and from what I've seen, girls love it when you look like you live your life with or without them and you can live with them not putting out for you. I've been on both ends  with the same girl, where she told me she started losing interest since I was ""trying too hard"" to me then just genuinely not giving a fuck and it worked out perfectly for me. ""Flow like water"", don't let a woman be a dam you go out of your way to find and push over

* **Never Ever Be Needy**

Anyone who's spent a minute on this sub knows this is one of the cornerstones of the sexual strategy aspect of RP. It's not fun for anyone and a complete turn off. Women desire a man who does his own thing and who countless other women desire and talk about. If you do get needy occupy yourself, you're a grown ass man you got shit to do instead of gazing at the stars wondering ""What could have been"" or picking flowers while muttering ""She loves me, she loves me not"". If any of you kill yourselves over a girl I will personally travel to the afterlife, pull your ass back into the realm of the living and knock some fucking sense into you. Oneitis is a debilitating condition that throws anyone off their game. You need to *shut that shit down*, even if it's a slight ""she's not like other girls"". This also has to do with my point on never settling. More on that later

* **Never Get Jealous**

Girls always try and rattle up suspicion or jealousy/envy in a man to keep them on their dog leash. It's one of their stupid covert games, don't fall for it. You shouldn't ever care. In a high school class my (BP) friend told me ""Man I just heard the girls talking about how they send pics of guys in our class to guys in their contacts list to make them jealous"". I just laughed at him while they were around us and said ""You have so much to learn"". Ended up getting spammed by texts from a girl trying to get my attention which they noticed and started eyefucking me ever since. Poetic

* **Never Lose Your Cool**

Frame. Frame frame frame. Breathe frame, be frame, live frame. This is perhaps the most potent and powerful tool in your arsenal. If a guy wants to get into a fight, as Sun Tzu said, ""The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting."". Don't ever get mad at a girl or anyone, you look like a childish idiot and she dries up like the Sahara desert. Fun fact, every girl I know who's boyfriend did something along the lines of ""She has a man now"" broke up after a week max. It shows insecurity and women can gauge insecurity like sharks can smell blood in the water

* **Never Be Too Much of A Dick**

I really wish I listened and reflected more when I read about comfort tests on here. You need to be able to identify and relate a girl's emotions to game her at your maximum potential. Sure some are going to go for you since you're a complete douchebag though those girls are the less sought after. Charm is the right amount of comedy, mystery, interest and teasing. Do too much of a god thing and it creates an imbalance, in this case teasing. You need to give her an emotional roller coaster of ups and downs, but do too many downs and the ride shuts down

* **Never Be An Emotional Tampon**

Girls always have options no matter what for ""nice"" listeners. You can hear her out from time to time although set boundaries to know what you're about. If any of you have a hard time remaining distant think of it this way: if you won't be her emotional tampon someone else will. And she sure as fuck won't be banging the emotional tampon

* **Never Take Things Personally**

Girls are more scared of rejection than guys, it's why they rarely approach and none can game. It's one small meaningless interaction that could result in you knocking boots or a confidence boost exercise. If she bails, just understand what her nature is and it's not you, it's her. This is including and not limited to; flaking, playing games, shit testing. Not taking things personally also helps with the abundance mentality and DGAF attitude

* **Never Be Afraid of Taking Risks**

Also great life advice for success. Similar to previous point however I know damn well I don't want to live with any regrets in life so I'll take the harmless risk of approaching and seeing how it goes. Best case scenario: Plate or whatever you're looking for
Worse case scenario: Rejection. Despite this you still get out of your comfort zone, ergo improving nonetheless

* **Never Be Interrogative**

What I mean by this is you don't want to ask questions such as ""Want to meet up at this park at a time?"" or ""What's your favourite 11th century artpiece"". Questions are fine and such but don't overdo it. However, **you should never ever ask, you must always command (this does not include sex). Setting logistics especially**. Standard of her ""where are we eating"" or ""I'm free Friday"" is you replying with ""I know this great Chinese place. I'll pick you up at 8"" or ""Let's do a park walk at 6PM Friday"" respectively. I found that using my ending cold approach line to ""Let's exchange numbers, I'll take yours"" works perfectly as it's friendly, a suggestion into a leading command and makes you look like you know what you're doing. I highly suggest implementing it if you have not already

* **Never Betray Your Senses**

If you're seeing red flags galore or feel like you're in the house from Poltergeist, abandon ship. If you sense somethings off or you shouldn't push then don't. Trust your gut. You'll know the difference between butterflies in your stomach to ""some kind of fuckery is going on here"". This point also includes the voice inside your head like ""Don't text her again man, it's only been a day"". Last point is a good example of betraying your senses

* **Never Settle**

""When you settle you get what you settled for"" -A guy who's name I forgot. You need to keep up your standards since mentality makes all the difference and once you start caving in to the occasional Miss McDonalds or Mrs. Human Potato Head since you've been having a ""dry spell"" then numerous problems will arise. Don't do it, only fuck who you believe you should be fucking (while also having major self confidence to uphold high standards). It's principles, it's self discipline and self control. It's right

* **Never Game, Let Alone Fuck a Bipolar Girl**

If you want to open Pandora's box on your dick, be my guest. Just remember the phrase ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter"" when she's starting to flip shit and is a hair strand away from accusing you of abusing her

Symptoms to spot one are listed and not limited to; mood swings, threatening to chop your dick off, screaming and shouting, having the crazy eyes, maniacal laughter 

*With all that being said, the world is your oyster. Go get 'em Tiger. Good luck and enjoy*",2018-04-08 01:25:31
82,Stoicism 101: A Primer on How to Be,1360,0,1360,3a2bl4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3a2bl4/stoicism_101_a_primer_on_how_to_be/,147,1434506289.0,"**Summary**
---

Stoicism
---

Stoicism is an ancient Greek school of philosophy founded at Athens by Zeno of Citium. The school taught that virtue, the highest good, is based on knowledge, and that the wise live in harmony with the divine Reason (also identified with Fate and Providence) that governs nature, and are indifferent to the vicissitudes of fortune and to pleasure and pain.

That's the textbook definition.  But it's more functional to get to the *how.*  

Doing is the best way to learn.

---

Stoicism keeps the following beliefs:^**
---
* If you are unhappy, it is your fault.
* Everything is temporary
* We are social beings with a social duty
* Hedonism is not the path to happiness
* Fame & Fortune are overrated
* A philosophy of life must be lived
* Do not long for an ideal situation
* Maximize positive emotions and minimize negative emotions

Strategies
---
* Rephrase goals so that they are entirely within your control
* Have nothing you are not prepared to lose
* Live simply
* Negative visualization
* Exercise self-denial
* Resist materialism
* Accept what cannot be changed
* Refuse to consider yourself the victim
* Practice misfortune
* Live in accordance with human nature

---

**Stoicism 101**
---

If you are unhappy, it is your fault
---
You and only you can make you happy.  Other people and other things cannot *make* you happy, but you can find happiness through their medium.  Wood does not make one happy, but cutting, sanding, and assembling wood into a piece of art or furniture can bring happiness *through the actions you take with it.*  Your girl may not make you happy, but being a leading force in your life, and by virtue hers, you can find happiness *through the actions you take with her.*

Inversely, you cannot, and should not expect to, make others happy.  It is their responsibility to find happiness *through the actions they take with you.*

Everything is temporary
---
Life, relationships, your car, *your relationships with women,* are all temporary.  Entering into the idea that *I have a girlfriend* is an easy way of saying, *I don't have to try to do better because I locked down my girl*  This is laziness and sloth.  Nothing is forever, but the longevity of things and relationships, and people can be extended through positive actions and regular maintenance and improvement.

We are social beings with a social duty
---
You are a social creature, and as such, you crave the interactions with other social creatures.  You have friends, a girl or two, maybe children.  These people comprise the network of which you have a *social duty.*  You also have a social duty to those you work with, and your town, and your state, nation, and the world.  Everything you do should be for the betterment of your circles of social duty.  Social duty can lead to gaining AMOG status in a group.

Hedonism is not the path to happiness
---
Hedonism, a defining trait of the *me generation*, is the constant search for self-indulgence.  Hedonism thrives on instant gratification and makes one dependent on the false idea that *other things* and *other people* can and should make them happy.  Hedonism is being a spoiled child; hedonism is looking to lose weight without the effort; hedonism is wanting girls to fuck you without trying to be someone she *actually wants to fuck.*  Hedonism is probably the main counter-point to *Stoicism.*

Fame & Fortune are Overrated
---
Fame and Fortune tie into hedonism; with these things, the ability, and temptation to have more and get more becomes overwhelming.  Fame brings a false happiness because it depends on *other people.*  Since only you can make yourself happy, the requirement of other people fame has nulls this ideal.  Fortune is the more useful of the two, by itself.  If the fortune you've accumulated is the result of fame (considering that everything is temporary, and the poor effects of hedonism) then consider that you haven't a fortune, but instead an amount of wealth that should be used to consider the future, your social duty to your family and community, and as a buffer to the temporary nature of everything.

A Philosophy of Life Must be Lived
---
Red Pill is not a philosophy; it is a *praxeology*; a science of human actions.  Red Pill incorporates many concepts known through evolutionary biology, sociological and psychological studies of macor and micro groups, and some philosophies, mainly *Stoicism.*  Stoicism is not something you are able to wade into, as with all philosophies, it must be lived to be understood.  You can't know it unless you experience it, you cant' learn unless you do it.

Do Not Long For an Ideal Situation
---
This plays into the old axiom of, ""*The grass is greener on the other side.*""  To be clear, it's the idea of thinking, ""*my life sucks, girls won't fuck me.*""  Wishing and talking about it does not make it so.  Doing, makes it so  If your grass is dead and dying, standing outside and talking about how it needs to be watered doesn't actually make the ground wet.  Instead, remember that ""*The grass is greener where you water it*,"" and then go out and water the grass.  Don't *imagine* a better life... make yourself to better to provide a better environment for your relationships to improve.

Maximize Positive Emotions and Minimize Negative Emotions
---
Negative emotions (anger, hate, resentment, etc.) are contraindicated when trying to make something better.  Resenting your girl for whatever reason won't make her change her behavior, and it will kill your mood, and by extension, hers.  Instead, know that: *If you are unhappy, it is your fault* and that you *Should not long for an ideal situation.*  Be happy with what you have, happy that you know how to improve it, and happy that you know you *can* improve it.  Maintaining a positive, optimistic outlook on what is happening allows you to see the possibilities that are hidden by negative thinking.  If one is resolved to not getting rescued, he will not find much use in starting a fire.

---

Now let's examine how we can bring these beliefs to fruition through practice.

Rephrase Goals So That They are Entirely Within Your Control
---
Let's pretend you want to run a 5K race.  You don't know how to run well, and by extension, you don't know how to train.  You get out and run, haphazardly, whenever, and however.  Race day comes and you turn in a paltry time of 26 minutes.  You resolve to be faster so you say, ""I will be faster next time.""

This is garbage thinking.  There is only an immeasurable ""faster"" and an immeasurable ""next time.""  That's anything over your previous time from 1 second or more for a length of time from no until *whenever.*  Use SMART goals:

* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Realistic
* Time-limited

A SMART goal version of this example: ""I will run a sub-25-minute 5K time in 12 weeks at the next scheduled race.""  

Apply these types of goals to everything, for Red Pillers, the best is to start with the gym: I will lose weight... I will lift x amount of lbs, and turn them into SMART goals.  Once you have SMART goals, you have a time frame within you can apply a schedule and plan.

Have Nothing You Are Not Prepared to Lose &amp;amp;amp; Resist Materialism
---
As Tyler Durden said, ""You are not your fuckin' khakis.""

Your car, your house, you clothes.  These are things, material and simple.  They are the product of your time, effort, and ability -the things you *cannot* live without.  

If your car, house, and all your belongings burned to the ground tomorrow, you would still have the tools to bring those things back in some form.  Your work allowed you the ability to pay for insurance to get new things when everything burns.  Your work is the combination of your time, effort, and ability.  These three things are the basis for all other material things you own.  These are innate to you.  Your house is not.

Live Simply
---
Living simply, or with *austerity,* allows you to appreciate the things you have.  This does not mean live *cheaply*... or even *frugally.*  One can own quality while living simply.  Simple living leads to an uncluttered environment which extends to an uncluttered life.  Your living space is a manifestation of your mind and your mind can be influenced by that living space.  A simple living space has limited distractions.

Negative Visualization
---
Imagine a scenario where your house has burned down.  Your family has no place to live, sleep, eat, etc.  What do you do?  Negative Visualization allows you to plan for the unexpected, or at least plan for the knowable problems that may arise.  Your house is gone.  Can you get a new one?  If so, how?  This is a good chance to exercise SMART goals.  Figure out a problem that hasn't happened, and then plan for that contingency.  This will give you a level of control over your life you didn't previously have.  For Red Pillers, we do this as part of the process of *swallowing* what would happen if I never had sex again?  How would I live?  What would I do?  How would I apply myself in a productive manner?*  Negative visualization leads to an *abundance mentality.*

Exercise Self-Denial &amp;amp;amp; Practice Misfortune
---
Exercising self-denial is the physical manifestation of *negative visualization.*  Live, temporarily, in a way that deprives you of something you *think* you depend on.  Some Red Pillers, while unplugging do this with sex; we call it ""monk mode.""  We distance ourselves from the thing we thought we needed and from the people we thought we needed it from.  In this, we find that we survive just fine and that we now have the energy to devote to *maximizing positive emotions* and working to *make ourselves* happy.  One of the classic ways men practice self-denial is through camping; we commune with nature, with very little (the bare basics in most cases,) and if you do it backpack-style, you limit yourself even further by way of what you carry and that you make yourself distant from society's technological boon, *the car.*

Accept What Cannot be Changed
---
You cannot change the way others are any more than you can change the rotation of the Earth or the expansion of the universe.  In remembering that *your happiness is made only by you* you recognize quickly that attempting to change others is an exercise in futility.  Instead, change yourself, as that is *all* that can be changed.

Refuse to Consider Yourself the Victim
---
You are not the victim.  Inasmuch as you cannot change others to your whim, you need to accept that they cannot change you.  If you feel the part of the victim, it is because you *allowed* that person, or situation, to keep you in a state of negativity.  People do not *victimize* you, you allow yourself to be a target.  Instead, stand up, defy the status quo as you have allowed it to form, and shake the foundations of what was formerly expected of you.  Claiming victim-hood is founded in laziness and a *lack of personal accountability.*

Live in Accordance With Human Nature
---
As you should accept what cannot be changed *directly*, you should recognize that which can be changed *indirectly.* Humans are not special and different.  While there are sociopathic and psychopathic exceptions, people tend to behave in very predictable ways.  By working ourselves into that system, we can effect the changes we want to see in others simply by changing ourselves.  With women, by simply being a better man, we find that our sexual outlook improves because the women around us adjust, and re-set themselves in a very predictable manner, to the new dynamic we have created.  Trying to live as we were, pre-Red Pill leads to similar predictable behavior, just manifested in a different way.

**Lessons Learned**
---

As you unplug, lift, read, and better yourself, examine which of these basic tents you have been following and continue to apply them, and in bettering yourself, figure out which Stoic fundamentals you are missing and add them.  We are working to better ourselves for the sake of ourselves and ultimately our marriages:

* Are you unhappy?  Whose fault is that?  Stop considering yourself the victim.
* Is your unhappiness permanent?  It is not; Set SMART goals, Accept that you can't change others, and improve yourself.
* You have a social duty to your family and friends.  Have you been living up to that job?  Start applying yourself to be better so that others can follow you.
* Are you avoiding your problems in order to find happiness through self-indulgence?  Seek happiness through self-improvement, not self-indulgence.
* Do you wish things were better?  That will not work; *make* things better.  Improve yourself, be better at what you do, set the goals to bring the improvements to fruition.
* Are you focusing on the negative aspects of your life?  A negative thinker sees only the *nots*, a positive thinker sees the *what ifs.*
* Are you depending on other people and things to make your life better?  Step back, imagine a life without, practice that life without, and make a plan for when it happens.

83,To the man shooting 3's in the gym today,1350,0,1350,6ubmxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6ubmxc/to_the_man_shooting_3s_in_the_gym_today/,175,1503020513.0,"I play basketball a few times a week at a local indoor court near my apartment. 


Often I see this guy there, we'll call him Brad. Brad's about 5'9, 28 years old, he's handsome— but only because he takes care of himself. He lifts, get's haircuts, he's in decent shape, lean. He has male friends, he does things, can hold a conversation and takes care of himself. Not a Chad by any stretch... but he's working on himself continuously.


Whenever we're playing basketball in the gym, I often witness Brad approach women charismatically and effortlessly. I've seen him cold approach 8's and 9's, convince them to watch him play basketball for 30 mins, then walk out of the gym with them after the game.


Today was different. I see Brad doing his thing as usual, shooting hoops and approaching women when the game dies down.


Brad see's this blonde HB9 and immediately B-lines to the locker (10 feet away from the court). Walks up to her and starts chatting with her. 2 mins pass, She's not feeling it, resting bitch face and giving him some dirty looks. He keeps at it... invites her to play basketball. She's still not feeling it.


Then about 15 seconds later, she turns her back to him without saying anything at all and gives him the most cold and unexpected *""slam the locker in your face""* rejections I've ever seen. It could have been out of high school musical.


I'll never forget what he said to her.


Just so she could hear him, he calmly — without chagrin, says **""your loss""**, as she walks away.


He picks up his ball, turns around, takes 2 steps and sinks a 3 from way downtown. Continues to play ball for the rest of the night, unfazed.


I commend Brad to get up after rejection like this. There was at least 15 men and women around him that saw exactly what happened. Most men would have social shame or at the very least some humiliation or discomfort. He didn't even flinch. Just turned around, says the truth, then shoots a 3.


We often talk back and forth about abundance mentality on TRP, but only in theory. Maybe some of us are like brad, but surely not all of us are. How many of us are practicing in real life situations like Brad? Who here would have even have approached an HB9 after her workout? I've never seen abundance mentality first hand like this in my life. This man didn't attach any of his value or worth to talking to this woman. He was simply a man who saw a woman he found attractive and approached her to see if she was also interested.


I know Brad personally, he's a great guy, and the words *""your loss""* is exactly the way to describe the how this woman should feel tonight.



*Post some FR's in the comments that you experienced rejection and how you could have handled it differently.*",2017-08-18 01:41:53

(I re-edited for decent paragraphs)

""My step-daughter wants her ""Real Dad"" to give her away""

My step-daughter will be getting married on August 3rd. The wedding planning has consumed most of her and her mother's life (I say her mother because we aren't married, though we've lived together for 10 years) for the past six months.

My step-daughter graduated last December from University. I paid for her to go to college, though it was a state school, it still ran $40K. She does not have a job and has been living with us for the duration of her college career and since her graduation. I also bought her a car to get back and forth from school when she finished high school.

From time to time her deadbeat father would pop into her life and she would fawn all over him. Although he has not contributed a cent to her education or paid any child support, though that is my girlfriend's fault as c.s. was not part of the settlement, she still loves him and wants him in her life. He stays long enough to break her heart by skipping town and breaking some promise that he made her.

The wedding venue holds 250 people max. I gave them a list of 20 people that I wanted invited, you know, since I was paying for everything. They told me that was no problem and they'd take care of it. So I let these people know they'd be getting an invite and they should save the date. Saturday, I saw one of my friends on this list at the golf course and asked if he was coming. He told me that he wasn't invited. He told me that he got an announcement, but not an invitation. He had it in his back seat (along with probably six months of mail) and showed it to me. Sure enough, it was just an announcement, and my name was nowhere on it. It had her dad's name and her mom's name and not mine.

This led to a pretty big fight with my GF, as I found out that NONE of my list of twenty ""made the cut"" for the final guest list because ""250 people is very tight."" I was pissed, but not a hell of a lot I could do because the important people in my life had already been offended. My GF said ""if some people didn't rsvp yes, I might be able to get a couple people in."" But that is an ultimate slap in the face in my opinion. So, I was boiling on Saturday.

Yesterday, we had a Sunday dinner with the future in-law's family and us and a surprise guest, the ""Real Dad."" At this little dinner my step-daughter announced that her ""Real Dad"" was going to be able to make it to her wedding and that now he'd be able to give her away. This was greeted with a chorus of ""Oh how great"" and ""How wonderful""s.

I don't think I have ever felt so angry and so disrespected. I was shaking. I took a few seconds to gather my composure, because I honestly wasn't sure if I would cry or start throwing punches or both. Once I was sure I'd be able to speak I got up from my chair and said I'd like to make a toast. I can't remember exactly what I said but the gist of it was this:

""I'd like to make a toast."" The sound of spoons against glasses ring in my years. ""It has been my great pleasure to be a part of this family for the past ten years."" Awe, how sweet. ""At this point in my life I feel I owe a debt of gratitude to bride and groom, because they have opened my eyes to something very important."" Confident smiles exchanged. ""They have showed me that my position in this family is not what I once thought it was."" And now a glimmer of confusion and shock begins to spread on the faces in the room. ""Though I once thought of myself as the patriarch or godfather of the family, commanding great respect and sought out for help in times of need, it seems instead that I hold the position of an ATM, good for a stream of money, but not much else. As I have been replaced as host, both on the invitations and in the ceremony, I am resigning my financial duties as host to my successor, Real Dad. So cheers to the happy couple and the path they have chosen."" I finished my drink. ""You all can let yourselves out.""

Is this selfish? I'm supposed to shell out 40 - 50 grand for a wedding that I can't invite anyone to? That I am not a part of? I'm so done with this crap. I'm done with my step-daughter, I'm done with my GF. I transferred the money out of our joint account last night. (she has not had a job since she moved in with me) This morning I called all the vendors I had written checks to for deposits to refund my money. At present it looks like I'll lose around 1500, for the venue, but the other vendors have been great about refunding.

TLDR: You want your ""REAL DAD"" to be on the invitation, to give you away and to sit at the head table, fine, your ""REAL DAD"" can pay for everything too.

EDIT: The immediate aftermath was tantrum and people sitting there mumbling while not actually saying anything to me, but to each other. After much yelling with the GF about me being selfish, I spent the night in my home office and no one knocked on my door, not once. Today's aftermath is kind of depressing for me. GF brought me Bride's wedding planner to show me how much work I was ruining. I thumbed through it, found a page in the music section for Father / Daughter dances. All of the songs were catered to Real Dad's taste. So I thought they were just being disrespectful, but now I'm feeling like they never really gave a crap at all, especially since the menu included two ingredients I'm allergic to, that actually made me laugh. Either way, I'm glad to be done, returned the planner and asked her when she and bride could move out. Also, I never promised to pay for the wedding. I offered them the use of my home when they were sure it was going to be small, but other than that, all I've heard is how it's the Bride's family that should pay, so, let it be the bride's family then, aka, not me.

EDIT: June 9th 1:15 am. Girlfriend and Bride are now moved out. They are moving in with the groom. It was very hard not to be petty with some of the ""belongings"" they took with them, but it's done and I switched out the locks and now it's time for a brew. I can't believe how popular this story got, but I feel good to be given support by so many. If I find out what happens with the wedding, I will let you know, but I can't guarantee that I will put in the effort to find out. From what I've heard they are trying to ""scale things back"" and get his parents to help out. GF burned bridges when I found out she tried to write herself a check on our joint account the day after the unpleasantness. By then I had already moved money, so I guess I'm a bigger ass than her, but I could feel it coming. That's all. Thanks.",2014-01-20 01:28:12

I am a 24 year old man. I fell into dating an older single mother earlier this year. She cheated on me and when I tried to break up with her she called the cops and said I abused her. The cops arrested me without even asking me if it was true. I was bailed out and given a 60 day protective order to stay away from her. I ignored her countless text, emails, voicemails, handwritten letters left on my trucks windshield for 2 weeks. She told me if I met her she would tell the cops the truth that she made it up. I came over and she gave me to falsely dated letters of confession. We were driving down the road later that night almost to her house in a suburban neighborhood when she, out of nowhere, threw my dog out of my vehicle, jumped out and ran to a random house screaming as if I was trying to rape her. This was right in the middle of a civil discussion, completely by surprise. The cops arrested me again for violating the protective order. Jail again. My state appointed attorney told me to accept the plea deal. 8 years probation, 250 hours of community service etc, and that I'd have 30 days to change my mind and think about it. He lied. I had 30 days to appeal and the judge has to decide if I can get my day in court. Hired good attorney for 7500 dollars to appeal. Judge takes it under consideration for 2 weeks and I get a call not 2 hours ago saying the motion is denied. I have a mountain of evidence showing I'm innocent. I am an army veteran with no prior criminal record from a good relatively wealthy family. I had a good future in front of me. I don't know where I am going with this. I just had to get this off of my heart. I have a felony on my record now and my future is ruined without ever even having a day in court. I don't know what to do.",2015-11-05 04:20:37

This is an art that must be practiced, and in do time you will reap it's benefits.

Let me tell you, a lot of men these days are straight up gay, really. They suck this world's dick & swallow, when it should be the other way arround. You're a slave to the situation and have the emotional strength/stability of a bitch on her cycle. Here's a key ability that a lot of us are missing today.

* Suffer In Silence

I know I always got pissed off when my father told me this. I'd fall out of a tree and get the wind knocked out of me,  ""suffer in silence"" is what I got.
My girlfriend cheats on me and goes with another man ""suffer in silence"". I have to a lot of chores to do that will take all fucking day, ""suffer in silence"". I'm about to get my ass whipped for setting stuff on fire when I was told not to, ""Turn around and suffer in silence"". I didn't know until now that I was being groomed into an emotional stronghouse.

The very act of complaining or telling someone your problems is weakness, for the mere fact that you're trying to let someone else hold the emotional burden you have. That's all complaining is, a cry for help or relief from an outside source other than yourself.

Suffering in Silence goes hand in hand with being tough. It's being strong for others in the midst of soul crippling pain. It's carrying your own weight and getting the job done.

Men are productive & logical  (At least a few of you still are) and we shouldn't have time for things that are counterproductive like complaining/crying. It gets nothing done, it solves no problem. Complaining is what women do, because most the time they don't have the physical capability to get shit done themselves. 
 
To sum this up, here's one of the greatest quotes from TWD for yall to keep in mind.

""If you have to eat shit, best not to nibble. 'Bite, chew, swallow, repeat. goes quicker.""

For the past 6 months I was on the street and going from shelter to shelter. 

You know how many shelters there were for battered women? Or women in general? Dozens upon dozens. I couldn't believe it. I've been denied entry, turned away, and kicked out for stupid shit. 

I was at a men's shelter and went to the other side of town for a couple of job interviews. The buses ran late but I told the shelter manager that I wouldn't be able to make curfew. 

He acted as if he understood but as soon as I came back this fucker gave me a ""warning"". After three warnings you're kicked out for 90 days. 

I was like fuck this shit. They also had a policy of making those with income (I get VA disability compensation) to set 50% aside for savings. Sounds reasonable until you realize that you need their permission to access your own money and fuck waiting 2 years in a shelter to give you section 8 housing. Like who can live like that? 

I was kicked out after I withdrew all of my savings without their permission twice. 

Call me a narcissist or a slave to my ego, but I felt relieved to be from under their thump. As if I had to be grateful to them for letting me sleep in a bunk bed with other Vietnam war vets who are coughing up a lung and spreading the flu around. 

At the end of the day, the only person I need to depend on is myself and MY own resources.

So I was back on the streets. I had a plate that lived 7 miles away. At the time her car was fucked and I needed a place to lay low so I said ""fuck it"" and walked. I've done 20 mile hikes with the Marines in full gear and a medpack, so I remind myself that 7 miles in the cold with a backpack and street clothes was nothing. 

Once I made it there and slept for the night I managed to get ahold of a case worker that helped me look for a spot. Living off of hotel rooms were killing me and I couldn't stay at my plate's place long term because a man needs his own castle and you can't let someone else have the power to kick you out and control your destiny. Been there, done that. 

My job interviews fell through so I went from place to place in search of work. One time I stupidly was stuck in the cold with a dead phone and needed a place to charge it. 

Damn near EVERY establishment denied me entry. 

It was like I was the scum of the Earth. Security guards confronting me as if I was a wanted criminal just because I asked to borrow an outlet to charge my phone. 

Finally after what seemed like hours of walking, I stumbled upon a boogie Marriot hotel. I thought that there was no way they'd let me sit down and charge my phone. 

Lo' and behold they were more than happy enough to let me sit down and charge my phone. In fact the receptionist said ""Take all the time that you need."" Almost brought a tear to my eyes. 

After a week of wandering and sleeping on park benches, I managed to stumble on a motel that was hiring. I negotiated my pay along with a permanent room in the motel for work. 

As I sit here in my room and reflect on my journey I realize that I lost everything I had built from a couple years ago. I had to crawl through the mud, sleep in the rain, and ask for favors that NO ONE was willing to help me with. 

There is a point where you become so angry that you become laser focused. It's like tunnel vision.

 I was so OVER everything. I was over with being broke, over with everyone shitting on me, over with being kicked out of local establishments, and over having less than a THIRD of the resources that women get, that I obsessively searched for a solution. 

Suddenly, what I lost didn't matter. Reaching new heights did. 

And it starts now. 

If you've ever been in my shoes then you know exactly what I'm talking about. No one cares about your struggles, and no one cares about YOU. If you can't provide anything then you might as well die. 

I looked back at the lessons from those who lost everything and the mindset they had to bounce back. Steve Jobs being removed from Apple, Napoleon escaping exile and returning to France, Abraham Lincoln failing practically every business venture he's ever had, etc. 

They used their failures as a foundation to build their power because the harsh truth is that only YOU can see it through and bend the world to YOUR will. Don't bend your will to appease world. 


There is comfort in knowing that no one truly gives a flying FUCK about you because it sets you free. I demanded that the motel manager let me stay and work because why not? What did I have to lose by trying? 

Even my social worker was surprised, but my ambitions have not been sated. I need to save as much as I can and get my own condo or apartment. Hell I had a dream about a penthouse overlooking the city. It's time to get to work. 

Happy Fucking New Year.",2020-01-10 00:43:52
88,Letter at 50 to a younger self,1339,0,1339,6if639,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/6if639/letter_at_50_to_a_younger_self/,173,1498005161.0,"Letter to a younger self.

Here are some things that are going to happen to you. Take heed and avoid the bad things, make the good things happen, and while there will still be a struggle, it may be a better journey than where your life has led you to be at 50. 

So many people act as something that they are not. Most people don’t have the integrity they claim they do. Most people wont say what it is they really want, and may conceal their real intentions. Even the best among us. Beware of the hidden lies and cons after going in a given direction. 

Resist what does not seem right. Move on, continue your search, keep open to new people and opportunities and shut down all those that will suck you soul out of you with drama, diversions, and decadence.

What you see to lure you in will never be what you get. Power is in manipulating others with what they want. Power is the lie that says you are worth nothing when in truth you have every right. Power is the lie that isolates you when the truth is you belong in the world. 

Technology, especially in reference to the Internet, actively isolates everyone more than it brings people together. Piece by piece technology interferes with every human interaction and replaces it with a simulation. The wealthiest people in the world, whatever your measure of wealth is, are those who are the most social. Consider how many people a spiritual or political leader has met in his life, and consider how much of a rich life that can represent. Isolation, by whatever cause, is poverty.

Most of your aspirations will never come to pass. Often, your aspirations will be used against you and for profit. Still if you want something, you must do much more research and learning about what is really needed to require it, you should do much more work to learn what that is than you expect you must do. As for your deepest desires that align with who you are, find a way to live them. Regret can drive you mad. 

In this modern age, there are endless lures to distract you from even beginning to think about what you truly need to do to improve your plight. A massive amount of things pushed in front of you is a lie. Consider the massive industry of unhealthy carbohydrates, pornography, political propaganda, overpriced products of every description, so much of it a contrived need.
 
Other people don’t have your interest in mind. Not even the people closest to you. However, if you can find or creating a small group of like minded people who share knowledge and resources among each other, it can be the most valuable method to improving your own life. 

Don’t remain working at home forever. Turn it into something else eventually or move on. It is always in somebody else's interest to keep you isolated. Do this if you must, but it is isolating, and you belong in the world. It is in somebody else's interest to keep you at home. There are no assurances that you will be sufficiently supported to cover all your costs, with the depreciation of your equipment, inflation, and the imperative to continue to invest in your life savings. 

Get work in the greater community, where the real opportunities are. The commute may be costly and frustrating, people toxic, but obviously the ones who flourish and prosper are those exposed to each other in a work place, out in the world, not shut up at home consulting.

The world is being destroyed with lies, especially when profit is possible. Every possible angle is tried in the desperate struggle for anything, and in the belief that this way is the only way that matters, because everyone else practices it. Still it is not too much to strive for a little peaceful square of it for yourself. It is also possible to end up with nothing despite the best of intentions. 

Nobody wants you to know any of the above. It is in the interest of someone else that keeps you isolated, divided, and unaware of it. You must come up with the solutions to these problems yourself.

Edit: Thank you for the comments and great feedback. I wrote this late last night and could refine it I am sure, but there you go. Perfection shouldn't be the enemy of progress now, should it? Perhaps you all should take a turn at writing a letter to your former self every so often, as an exercise in understanding the route your life is taking.

89,The Sixteen Commandments Of Poon,1337,0,1337,8v9fd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8v9fd2/the_sixteen_commandments_of_poon/,206,1530475127.0,"**I. Never say ‘I Love You’ first**

Women want to feel like they have to overcome obstacles to win a man’s heart. They crave the challenge of capturing the interest of a man who has other women competing for his attention, and eventually prevailing over his grudging reluctance to award his committed exclusivity. The man who gives his emotional world away too easily robs women of the satisfaction of earning his love. Though you may be in love with her, don’t say it before she has said it. Show compassionate restraint for her need to struggle toward yin fulfillment. Inspire her to take the leap for you, and she’ll return the favor a thousandfold.

**II. Make her jealous**

Flirt with other women in front of her. Do not dissuade other women from flirting with you. Women will never admit this but jealousy excites them. The thought of you turning on another woman will arouse her sexually. No girl wants a man that no other woman wants. The partner who harnesses the gale storm of jealousy controls the direction of the relationship.

**III. You shall make your mission, not your woman, your priority**

Forget all those romantic cliches of the leading man proclaiming his undying love for the woman who completes him. Despite whatever protestations to the contrary, women do not want to be “The One” or the center of a man’s existence. They in fact want to subordinate themselves to a worthy man’s life purpose, to help him achieve that purpose with their feminine support, and to follow the path he lays out. You must respect a woman’s integrity and not lie to her that she is “your everything”. She is not your everything, and if she is, she will soon not be anymore.

**IV. Don’t play by her rules**

If you allow a woman to make the rules she will resent you with a seething contempt even a rapist cannot inspire. The strongest woman and the most strident feminist wants to be led by, and to submit to, a more powerful man. Polarity is the core of a healthy loving relationship. She does not want the prerogative to walk all over you with her capricious demands and mercurial moods. Her emotions are a hurricane, her soul a saboteur. Think of yourself as a bulwark against her tempest. When she grasps for a pillar to steady herself against the whipping winds or yearns for an authority figure to foil her worst instincts, it is you who has to be there… strong, solid, unshakeable and immovable.

**V. Adhere to the golden ratio**

Give your woman 2/3 of everything she gives you. For every three calls or texts, give her two back. Three declarations of love earn two in return. Three gifts; two nights out. Give her two displays of affection and stop until she has answered with three more. When she speaks, you reply with fewer words. When she emotes, you emote less. The idea behind the golden ratio is twofold — it establishes your greater value by making her chase you, and it demonstrates that you have the self-restraint to avoid getting swept up in her personal dramas. Refraining from reciprocating everything she does for you in equal measure instills in her the proper attitude of belief in your higher status. In her deepest loins it is what she truly wants.

**VI. Keep her guessing**

True to their inscrutable natures, women ask questions they don’t really want direct answers to. Woe be the man who plays it straight — his fate is the suffering of the beta. Evade, tease, obfuscate. She thrives when she has to imagine what you’re thinking about her, and withers when she knows exactly how you feel. A woman may want financial and family security, but she does not want passion security. In the same manner, when she has displeased you, punish swiftly, but when she has done you right, reward slowly. Reward her good behavior intermittently and unpredictably and she will never tire of working hard to please you.

**VII. Always keep two in the kitty**

Never allow yourself to be a “kept man”. A man with options is a man without need. It builds confidence and encourages boldness with women if there is another woman, a safety net, to catch you in case you slip and risk a breakup, divorce, or a lost prospect, leading to loneliness and a grinding dry spell. A woman knows once she has slept with a man she has abdicated a measure of her power; when she has fallen in love with him she has surrendered nearly all of it. But love is ephemeral and with time she may rediscover her power and threaten to leave you. It is her final trump card. Withdrawing all her love and all her body in an instant will rend your soul if you are faced with contemplating the empty abyss alone. Knowing there is another you can turn to for affection will fortify your will and satisfy your manhood.

**VIII. Say you’re sorry only when absolutely necessary**

Do not say you’re sorry for every wrong thing you do. It is a posture of submission that no man should reflexively adopt, no matter how alpha he is. Apologizing increases the demand for more apologies. She will come to expect your contrition, like a cat expects its meal at a set time each day. And then your value will lower in her eyes. Instead, if you have done something wrong, you should acknowledge your guilt in a glancing way without resorting to the actual words “I’m sorry.” Pull the Bill Clinton maneuver and say “Mistakes were made” or tell her you “feel bad” about what you did. You are granted two freebie “I’m sorry”s for the life of your relationship; use them wisely.

**IX. Connect with her emotions**

Set yourself apart from other men and connect with a woman’s emotional landscape. Her mind is an alien world that requires deft navigation to reach your rendevous. Frolic in the surf of emotions rather than the arid desert of logic. Be playful. Employ all your senses. Describe in lush detail scenarios to set her heart afire. Give your feelings freedom to roam. ROAM. Yes, that is a good word. You’re not on a linear path with her. You are ROAMING all over, taking her on an adventure. In this world, there is no need to finish thoughts or draw conclusions. There is only need to EXPERIENCE. You’re grabbing her hand and running with her down an infinite, labyrinthine alleyway with no end, laughing and letting your fingers glide on the cobblestone walls along the way.

**X. Ignore her beauty**

The man who trains his mind to subdue the reward centers of his brain when reflecting upon a beautiful female face will magically transform his interactions with women. His apprehension and self-consciousness will melt away, paving the path for more honest and self-possessed interactions with the objects of his desire. This is one reason why the greatest lotharios drown in more love than they can handle — through positive experiences with so many beautiful women they lose their awe of beauty and, in turn, their powerlessness under its spell. It will help you acquire the right frame of mind to stop using the words hot, cute, gorgeous, or beautiful to describe girls who turn you on. Instead, say to yourself “she’s interesting” or “she might be worth getting to know”. Never compliment a girl on her looks, especially not a girl you aren’t fucking. Turn off that part of your brain that wants to put them on pedestals. Further advanced training to reach this state of unawed Zen transcendence is to sleep with many MANY attractive women (try to avoid sleeping with a lot of ugly women if you don’t want to regress). Soon, a Jedi lover you will be.

**XI.  Be irrationally self-confident**

No matter what your station in life, stride through the world without apology or excuse. It does not matter if objectively you are not the best man a woman can get; what matters is that you think and act like you are. Women have a dog’s instinct for uncovering weakness in men; don’t make it easy for them. Self-confidence, warranted or not, triggers submissive emotional responses in women. Irrational self-confidence will get you more pussy than rational defeatism.

**XII.  Maximize your strengths, minimize your weaknesses**

In the betterment of ourselves as men we attract women into our orbit. To accomplish this gravitational pull as painlessly and efficiently as possible, you must identify your natural talents and shortcomings and parcel your efforts accordingly. If you are a gifted jokester, don’t waste time and energy trying to raise your status in philosophical debate. If you write well but dance poorly, don’t kill yourself trying to expand your manly influence on the dancefloor. Your goal should be to attract women effortlessly, so play to your strengths no matter what they are; there is a groupie for every male endeavor. Except World of Warcraft.

**XIII. Err on the side of too much boldness, rather than too little**

Touching a woman inappropriately on the first date will get you further with her than not touching her at all. Don’t let a woman’s faux indignation at your boldness sway you; they secretly love it when a man aggressively pursues what he wants and makes his sexual intentions known. You don’t have to be an asshole, but if you have no choice, being an inconsiderate asshole beats being a polite beta, every time.

**XIV. Fuck her good**

Fuck her like it’s your last fuck. And hers. Fuck her so good, so hard, so wantonly, so profligately that she is left a quivering, sparking mass of shaking flesh and sex fluids. Drain her of everything, then drain her some more. Kiss her all over, make love to her all night, and hold her close in the morning. Own her body, own her gratitude, own her love. If you don’t know how, learn to give her squirting orgasms.

**XV. Maintain your state control**

You are an oak tree. You will not be manipulated by crying, yelling, lying, head games, sexual withdrawal, jealousy ploys, pity plays, shit tests, hot/cold/hot/cold, disappearing acts, or guilt trips. She will rain and thunder all around you and you will shelter her until her storm passes. She will not drag you into her chaos or uproot you. When you have mastery over yourself, you will have mastery over her.

**XVI.  Never be afraid to lose her**

You must not fear. Fear is the love-killer. Fear is the ego-triumph that brings abject loneliness. You will face your fear. You will permit it to pass over and through you. And when your ego-fear is gone you will turn and face your lover, and only your heart will remain. You will walk away from her when she has violated your integrity, and you will let her walk when her heart is closed to you. She who can destroy you, controls you. Don’t give her that power over yourself. Love yourself before you love her.

***

The closer you follow the letter of these commandments, the easier you will find and keep real, true unconditional love and happiness in your life.

90,The Psychology of Approaching Groups Of Very Hot Women In Bars.,1333,0,1333,553gwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/553gwd/the_psychology_of_approaching_groups_of_very_hot/,159,1475200547.0,"In club/bar environments it's often thought the most difficult approach of all is directly approaching a group of uber hot women and successful endgame of taking one  home. This post demonstrates a number of methods to give these  girls the good seeing too they all crave and make everyone happy in the process.
The methods outlined can be deconstructed and used in isolation in various other situations, but in this case they're usually all needed due to our quarry being in a group and all hot. Social engineering  methods will run alongside psychological ones for maximum impact.
 The group should be of a minimum of four women and a maximum of ten, and preferably receiving a lot of passive attention from other males.
 
Please note: This is a meta strategy to achieve an end goal. If at any point your target shows genuine interest you can skip steps, as you're already where you want to be (but watch for compliance tests).

**Step 1: Identifying Your Targets**
The first step is deciding which  girls you're going to use as your gateway strategy. I say, ""girls"" because as well as selecting a target (your end game girl) you will also need to identify one of the other girls as a leverage  point for the social dynamic aspect of the method.

[ In this case it doesn't have to be mother hen as the status of the girls in the group is  pretty similar so there's little difference in *""ranking""* due to them all being 9's or 10's.]

 The girl to use as leverage will be the girl most interested in being approached and thus most likely ascribed by the other girls unconsciously as their biggest sexual  rival. To identify her, study the group carefully. Your selection will  seem less interested in the inane female chit chat taking place and will tend to scan the environment, looking around to check who is in the venue (which Chads) more so than the other girls.

 She's looking to see which guys are there as it's her intention to get laid that night. She will most likely be wearing the most revealing outfit in the group and peaking in her ovulation cycle. Possibly wearing something red or maybe just red lipstick or nails as women seem to have a predilection for the colour -combined with skimpy outfits- when they're at their most fertile, and thus at their horniest.

[Not wearing red isn't a deal breaker, but if you're 50/50 over two girls in the group, then use the red wearing one as your default selection. A number of scientific studies have correlated the colour to women at their most fertile/horny. As the saying goes *""Red shoes, no knickers""*.
 
 Women are always checking out other girls in public venues to monitor their status in the ongoing attraction hierarchy - but if you watch - you will see that girls with red clothing or nails/lipstick receive particular attention when they're first spotted. The other girls know full well the significance of what's going on, even if it's just on an unconscious level.

 The other girls in the group will know this too unconsciously and attempt to engineer spoiling strategies to counter their rival. You may notice they will look at her more to check what's she's up to and rubberneck during conversations they're having with the others to keep tabs on her: Watch for this.

 The final sign is a body language indicator much beloved by used car salesmen and one (now that you've read this) you're going to see, all the time and even notice yourself doing it to the point you say ""WTF!"" when you see the hidden matrix of attraction cues going on around you.


 Have you ever seen two people who know each other, meet and stop in the street for a chit chat, but one needs to get away because they're busy? Have you noticed what happens to the angle of one of their feet? It POINTS towards the direction they want to go: the direction they were originally heading, it's unconscious body language leakage indicating an ongoing desire that's found even in higher primates.

 Good car salesmen know this too, when they're chatting to a prospect on the lot they're keeping a close eye on where your foot is pointing as THAT'S the car you like. Your foot points towards things you like, and away from things you don't. We all do it, I do it, you do it and hot bitches in bars do it.

 Of all  the body language clues  the most accurate (and only ones which can be used in isolation) are eye contact and foot pointing. When you're stood in a bar or chatting to your buddies, the default position for you feet are the 5 minutes to 1 position. Look for girls who have a foot deviating from this stance unless there's a good reason, then look to see where it's pointing.

[In fact; next time you're in a bar or club with your buddies, look towards where one of your **own** feet are pointing. If one of them is pointed away from its default position then it's very likely pointing towards some hottie you have your eye on]

**In Summary**: The girl you are going  to use as leverage to assist your entry will be exhibiting what's known as an *""R cluster""*.


* Reconnaissance: She's scanning the bar looking for which guys (Chads) are in the venue as potential partners.
* Revealing: She will most likely be the most sexily dressed of the group.
* Red: She will most likely be wearing the colour red.
* Real Interest: One of her feet will be pointing away from the group and towards where her real interest lays, usually a man or group of men.


[Disclaimer: allow for pointing which may be towards the bar (she wants a drink), the toilets (she needs to pee), the dancefloor (she wants to dance) or the exit (she wants to leave) although you will only see these indicators when she's in conversation with someone  else. If she's not engaged in something she'll just act on what she wants without pointing ]

 Under any other circumstances this is the girl whom you should target in an approach strategy; whether it be a mother hen gateway -then move to your interest- or a direct approach to your interest from off the bat. Either way this is the girl most DTF that night.

 In this case however, with the group all being uber hotties this is the girl you will use as your leverage  point for entry  - without activating any alarm bells or bitch shields [sure you can game this girl after, once you're established yourself ] but the purpose of this strategy is gaining access first, disqualifying yourself from your approach girl (albeit temporarily) and then use your game skills to move things on.

 Your actual target girl is the next one down on the *""R cluster""* scale. She will be exhibiting some or all of the *""R cluster""* traits (though not to the extent of your leverage girl) but also target girl will be rubber necking your leverage  girl as her prime sexual rival that night. Women pick up on other girls who are ovulating on an unconscious level and adjust their behaviours sub consciously by mate guarding their partner more if they have one, and cockblocking their female friends if they're both single. You're going to use this unconscious behavioural drive for your own ends.


**Step 2: The approach.**
In this situation you have two types of frame.
 1/ The extant frame: Group of super hotties too good for anyone in the bar and *""girl power""* blowing off men and acting like a pack of bitches.

 2/ The intrinsic frame: The real frame, a group of sexual rivals jockeying for status, utilising devious feminine psychological methods on each other, but pretending to be best girly friends while they do it.

 The problem is:  An extant frame can be pretty solid due to what's known as embodied cognition and the girls actually start acting as if this **is** the reality they're in,  they start feeding their emotional states off each other in a feedback loop known as *""Limbic  resonance""* and post hoc rationalising their own behaviour (known as *""Hamstering""*....) to avoid cognitive dissonance.

 In broscience this is called *""Believing your own shit""*.
A radical deframe is required. Gentlemen, such a deframing  exists.

**""The Queens Of Sheba Opener.""**

 Internalise your RP mindset as the **selector** and approach your target girl direct (ensure she has a full drink as you don't want any distractions or default ""drink tooling"" programs firing up). Make sure she sees you are approaching so you don't trigger an auto pilot response by surprising her, then stop in front of her as if weighing her up for a few seconds, then ask the question.

*""Who's your friend?""*

 She'll be expecting a chat up line or random beta validation, but gets surprise instead (the type we DO need)  which derails normal shit testing programming (we're also generating an emotional response here, which is good) but curiosity will make her ask...

*""Which one?""* [ that's why we need a minimum of 4 girls in the group ].

 With a nod of your  head towards your leverage girl reply...

*""The one all the guys are interested in""*

 This is a **huge** deframe. There she is enjoying all this attention and validation, then all of a sudden the rug is pulled from under her: The attention and validation may not actually be for her!

 Hamster central rapidly boots up to protect her self-image.

*""The guys are looking at all of us....?""*

*""Is nobody actually interested in me and it's actually my friend that's creating all this interest from guys...?""*

*""I'm beautiful, but is she so much more attractive than me that all these guys don't care?""*

*""Am I the least attractive of my friends...?""*

*""What the fuck is my status in the group...?""*

All these thoughts go through her head in a split second as you've just triggered an *""imposter syndrome""* program to run in her mind. Not only that, but the source of it is her prime sexual rival who she unconsciously ascribes as a threat.

Oh fucking dear...

 Her status is now in limbo and  needs a reference point to stabilise itself so her limbic brain creates a sense of dread  causing her to reframe from the bottom up to achieve some stability to build from. The dread is hard-wired into her brain: In the ancestral environment a rapid change in circumstances could mean imminent danger or a big survival opportunity. The limbic brain doesn't trust your pre-frontal cortex (the conscious) to deal with it so pulls rank and drops into *heuristic* mode.
 
Heuristics are nothing more than pre-wired emotional responses on how to deal with something quickly. They come from the emotional brain and are combinations of responses based on previous similar experiences (the social emotions like, shame, guilt, jealousy etc) with some actually hard-wired into the brain's source code (like fear, anger, lust etc ). When these heuristics are running then you're also susceptible to influence, as you're locking onto someone else's frame as a scaffolding to bring you back to normality/stasis and the ""emotional traffic highway"" is now open for emotions coming in the opposite direction (from the other person).

 Your frame as selector and alpha is incorporated into her own.

[ To the vast majority of girls *""status""* within their peer group (which used to be the tribe) is of considerable importance as it had to be kept a close eye on in the ancestral environment to maximise the potential of mating with the highest alpha male they could get. It had to be monitored at all times and like I said action taken to avoid any potential loss and seize on the opportunity for any potential improvement.]
 
With very hot girls status is even more important  as being *""top girl""* was the genetic jackpot for their genes. These girls now pretty much have everything, the looks, the orbiters, the protectors, and all the other benefits which come from being an uber hottie. The one thing they have to work for is their status/value with other uber hotties in their group/tribe.

 Lost at sea she now starts to do something she very rarely does: She starts qualifying herself to you and sabotaging her rival.


**Step 3: The Lock In**

**Important** If you start validating her now, then any potential attraction will disappear very quickly. Remember this as you will have an urge to do so.

 The behaviour you drop into now is that of *""amused mastery""* with a heavy emphasis of skepticism. Cross your arms when she's validating herself, but listen to the criteria she's basing herself judged worth upon. See if you can find an adjective she seems keen on which you can use to preface the word *""Confident""*. When you've identified the word then make sure to slightly nod when you hear it (more about this later, but it's to do with what are called *""trancewords""*.) The nod is a way of analogically marking it through body language so that its significance is processed unconsciously, as body language is decoded by the unconscious brain first and the conscious secondly, but only if it appears to be incongruous will the conscious boot up to give it ""due process"".

Keep a wry amused smile on your face, she will sense that you're not taking the bait and most likely go some light kino on you to punctuate her emotional state and expect you to invest with some validation. Kino  her back, but always in a pushing fashion and don't look where you touch (it's creepy). Because of her emotional state your kino won't be processed at a conscious level as the cognitive buffer is filled with other concerns, but unconsciously it's getting through to her attraction centres.


**Step 4 The Lock Down**
 The key now is to drop her out of her emotional state temporarily and then spike it back up again using a process known as *""refractionation""*. Basically when someone comes out and then back into the same emotional state, the second time they go into it, it's more powerful. It's a method used by the *""speed seduction""* community to generate high levels of arousal in a woman, but in this case we're just using it for a different emotional model to suit our strategy.

 Uncross your arms with a sigh, relax and then change the subject to something mundane going on in the venue as if you're just chatting to one of your buddies. Men do not do this to uber hotties as their usual remit is to try to impress them. She will think you've disqualified her (causing slight confusion) as a potential partner and up your ascribed value in her mind. Carry on the conversation for about a minute and then drop the line.
*""Actually you have three big advantages over your friend""* (leverage girl).

[Credit for this goes once again to Mystery and was originally known as the *""Three Things About You Technique""*. Its methodology was to tell a girl two things about herself attraction wise that she didn't know, but not the third. The PUA could then either go sarge other girls or go to the washroom or bar knowing he had inoculated the girl from further approaches by other guys hanging around as she always wanted to find out the third.]

 It uses a cognitive bias we all have known as the *""Zeigernic effect""* and is very effective [I can vouch for its impact as I've had girls come to a bar they knew I was going next, wait outside a wash room for me, and even been pulled out of a taxi to find out the elusive third thing.]
 
**The Three Things**: This time, however we're going to use the *""things""* as vehicles for some pretty devious and cunning psychological deep mind influence.

 When she asks what they are, use the ones below and make sure to preface the first with the words *""The first one is""*. This is to create a language pattern known as an *""Ordinal"".

 An *""Ordinal""* is a presupposition that there will be a number of things. By using the word ""first"" you're implying that there will be a second, third, etc. The second, third may not even exist, but the listener presupposes that they do as you used the word ""first"".

[ The woman already knows there will be three things, but in this case you're using it a reinforcer to prevent cognitive drift ]

 Then use the word ""Because"". ""Because"" is a statement as opposed to a question and various studies have discovered the word as a preface generates more influence from the speaker. This is because the laws of cause and effect are programmed into all higher animal brains, but by using the word at the beginning of our list (use it only for the first thing) and going through the list in this order, we are starting a process called *""State Titration"" so each separate ""thing"" titrates into the next one, making the process seamless and generating *""cognitive fluency"" to prevent her critical factor booting up.

 [Count them off on your fingers as you do so. In this way you're again using a body language cue to anchor them.]

1/ "" The first thing is because...."" Then a comment on her appearance, but **not** anything physical. It's important that it's something which you genuinely like as the very fact that you have spotted it means it will be something which she wore for that purpose. Something like her dress or shoes making her look *""classy""* or *""sophisticated""* as if these are essential criteria for you in a partner (if you DO have essential criteria then use those instead as it will help your congruence).
 
She will see this as an advantage she has over her fellow beauty leverage girl and mentally agree.

 You have just started what's known as a *""Yes Set""* (getting her mind into the house of yes) to ease the next two things through.

2/ A comment on how she's a friendly girl and not standoffish. The reason for this is you're *""priming""* the *""friendly""* behaviour mindset (by ""half cocking"" the relevant network of neurons"" ) into her brain, so she will more likely to act friendly and  less keen to start shit testing you. Because you've already got her brain into yes mode (the essence of the *""yes set""*) from your first statement and you're titrating emotional state, her critical factor  (the pre-frontal cortex) usually lets the idea into her mind without much introspection. ( No need to use ""because"" or ""The .......thing is"", from now on as their work is done ).

3/ Now we use the most Machiavellian attraction trigger in existence...

 The Amygdala Feedback Loop.

 But first some background. You may have noticed I'm a big proponent of *""embodied cognition""*. This is for good reason. It's commonly reasoned that when the mind wants the body to do something, it sends a signal to cause the result it requires. This is true, but only half the story. When the body commits the action the mind requests, it sends a signal back to the brain to announce its new state. The brain analyses the return signal and tweaks its instructions in a feedback loop to fine-tune everything and achieve maximum efficiency.

 However...if you consciously induce that state in yourself or someone else then the unconscious picks up the return signal and assumes that the signal is the current *""state of play""* of how things are, and sychronises itself to it, feeding back the new mental model to the body in an ever strengthening loop until the new state becomes the new reality.

 There's been a lot of research into this and the original model was proven by researchers who asked test volunteers to read jokes with and without a pencil held in their mouth. They discovered that the volunteers found the jokes funnier with the pencils then without them.

Why?

Holding the pencil in the mouth requires the face to use the *""Zygomatic major muscle""* to do so. This muscle is also the one which unconsciously triggers when we smile. The brain senses that the muscle is triggering and infers that activity is happening in the body which correlates to a happy/funny state. Instead of the feedback loop going *""brain to body to brain to body....""* it begins at the state of the *""body""* instead. The mind adopts the state of the body (happy) to avoid dissonance and the new state becomes the norm, but in this case...
 You find the jokes funnier.

 So...we trigger a behaviour in the girl which correlates to her being attracted to someone.

**WARNING**

 Sometimes however, this feedback loop runs out of control and can actually cause a panic attack. Calibrate her state closely at this time as any other emotions ongoing in her psyche can hitch a ride on the loop, and some girls can go really crazy when this happens. We're running a pure attraction loop and nothing else here so be careful what you're doing.

 We count off our third finger, look her in the eye, pause, and then say......

*""The third thing is you make lots of very confident eye contact""*.

Why? Because very attractive girls are very adept at avoiding eye contact with random guys who constantly try to make it with them. If they didn't, then they would have no end of loser types she has no interest in approaching her and wasting her time.

 The only guys she **does* make eye contact with, are guys she is interested in or attracted to.
 You've induced a state of attraction in her as she will now adopt that behaviour with you. The body is saying to the brain *""I'm making a great deal of eye contact with this guy""* so her mind says *""Ok that must mean I am attracted to him, so make more of the same""* and the feedback loop continues.

The reasons she adopts the behaviour are.

1/ She's in validation mode with you as her sexual rival is stealing her thunder; she wants it back and if eye contact is an ace up her sleeve, then so be it.

2/ She's in the final stage of a *""yes set"".*

3/ Do you remember the bit about *""trancewords""* earlier? Trancewords are words (usually adjectives) based on a person's sense of values. These  values are an actual part of someones identity at their most powerful. When she's stating her case for being more attractive/desirable than her rival she's using what she considers her main advantages over her.

 They could be: *""I'm more passionate"", ""classy"", ""sophisticated"", ""deep"", ""seductive""* etc.

 So the final push to get this behaviour through to her limbic brain is to utilise a value which has already been ""preapproved"" by her unconscious as being important to her. This is a technique known as *""tailgating""*. You take a value very close to another person's belief model, link it to the value/behaviour you wish to induce and the very association of the latter to the former stamps the signal **approved for access to limbic brain** to the package as a whole. Into her mind it goes to be unwrapped back into its two separate values once it's arrives.
 
Machiavellian? Totally. Manipulative? Absolutely.
 
 So....For the final push... with a slight nod (our earlier state anchor) we say...

*""You make very confident (insert trance word here) eye contact""*.


**Step 5: Welcome To My Frame**

 This stage is the stage to drop her totally out of her frame and into yours. You invite her into your territory. One of the remits of an alpha male in the entire animal kingdom is that they have their own territory. In this case, it would either be where you were originally stood if you're on your own, or back to your wingmen/wingman if you're in a group. By doing so you're demonstrating territorial, attraction generating cues at the very deepest parts of her limbic mind. That's the place (amygdala) where the values ""Fight, Feed, Fuck"" reside.

 This is deep core and the place you want to be.

**Step 6: How The World Is**

 If you're on your own, then project the emotional behaviour and frame that's she's a plate that you're very fond of (mentally not verbally) and run with that, with the odd unpredictable intercession (this refractionates but also loads up her cognitive buffer to keep the unconscious highways clear).

 If you're with your buddies then brief them before the approach on what to do when you bring the girl over. A good first thing for one of them to say is.

*""Are we staying or are we going?""*

 By doing this you indicate to her that you're the leader of your group (the alpha) but also imply a *""scarcity""* mindset in her so she will infer that you may actually be leaving (after all this chemistry!) and make her invest more. 

 You of course reply...

*""I haven't decided yet""*

 The mindset your group should now operate on, is as if she's a girlfriend you've been dating a while, but they've just met her. The group frame that this is the reality in question will permeate unconsciously and eliminate any residual frame she has (people drop into the strongest frame they're interacting with 95% of the time).

 No doubt the buddies will be looking for a piece of the action too, in which case ask her a female opinion on something then get her to invite one of her friends over to back her up. Now her group is splitting, some of your guys can go over and chat to the remaining ones. Top R cluster girl is your best bet here for ease of entry.

 After that is up to you, but the goal you want is to separate and isolate all the girls into groups of two (two girls-two wingmen) then run with it, with the end goal of bouncing in pairs to the next venue, but keep your frame tight at all times.

**End Note**

The most important thing about this method is YOU. In all human interactions, people send out what could be called *""reality pings""* like a submarine's sonar. These *""pings""* detect the frame of an ongoing interaction and who's going to drop into whose frame. The pings happen on an unconscious level and give an emotional valence to the frame at hand. Most people know about body language communication at a meta level, but below that there are tiny nuances in behaviour and physiology called *""BMIRs"". This stands for *Behavioural Manifestations Of Internal Representations""*.

 BMIR's are impossible to consciously fake and also very difficult consciously to detect. They just give us a gut feeling about someone (although the American secret service does train its agents using some BMIRs called ""Facial Action Cues"" [Micro gestures of the face which last only 300 milliseconds] developed by a guy called Paul Ekman so it can be done.

Alas we don't have access to this level of training but there is a fast track method.

 Genuinely believing your TRP frame and knowing 100% that the method will work. When you do that your BMIRs are a 100% reflections of your intentions and mental frame. The woman gets the ""feelz"" about you on an unconscious level. Her ""reality pings"" are mapping your psyche and getting the thumbs up (it's based on the ""limbic resonance"" I covered earlier). Hypnotists utilise the concept by what's called ""going first"". They adopt the emotion they wish their subject to have, the subject picks up the BMIRs of the emotion, their mirror neurons inject it into their own ""global-workspace"" and they feel the emotion themselves.

Remember though: In field is chaos at the best of times with people coming in and out of set and a great deal of distractions (Mobile phones!) but the greater the integrity of your frame (your force field) the less effect these things will have.

**TL;DR** Look up the bit about foot pointing. It's the matrix unveiled of attraction intentions.

91,Woman thinks her guy friend is being an 'asshole' because he's no longer doing nice things for her after she rejected him.,1332,0,1332,3glvk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3glvk4/woman_thinks_her_guy_friend_is_being_an_asshole/,412,1439338286.0,"Link: https://archive.is/DIpeh

I think it's partly this guy's fault for being a doormat. A list of all the things he did for her:

>He would always offer a helping hand, or would listen. We'd have conversations on skype, and he'd always be supportive and offer friendly advice. At work, he was really flexible with his shifts and would always rearrange to cover mine. For example, if I couldn't make a shift on a certain day, and would prefer another day, he would always gladly swap with me. He was always friendly about it. When I was moving apartments a couple months ago, he helped me move my stuff. When I didn't have my car for about two weeks, he drove me to work and home every day. He was an incredibly good friend and I was really thankful to have someone like him around.

>And he was also incredibly emotionally supportive, whenever I'd talk about my issues with friends or family, he'd listen. I've had depression and anxiety in the past, I take meds for it, and it comes back every now and again. I have a lot of personal worries, fears and issues, and he's always ready to listen and be supportive.

He asks her out and of course she says no. Surprisingly he doesn't just become an orbiter and keep doing nice things for her, instead he moves on which annoys her:

>Then over the next few days I noticed things were a bit different. He would still talk to me, chit chat occasionally, smile, say Hi. But he wasn't as receptive to conversations with me any more. On skype when we'd talk, he'd take longer to respond, and seems always uninterested and giving one word responses.
With work, he's no longer swapping any shifts with me. He says he can't manage the time, and he's also on a busy work and life schedule that he can't always move things around. 

>I'm moving apartments again in a months time, and I asked if he'd be ready to help me move again like last time, he said probably not and that he's too busy.

He's not giving her undivided attention and doing her favors all the time so what's her reaction?

>Now suddenly, its almost like he's an asshole.

>Did I make friends with a ""nice guy""? Was he really just an asshole all along only pretending to be nice to get in my pants?

Lesson: So if a guy doesn't give you undivided attention and time, he's an asshole.


Best comment:

92,"Once you realize what interested women will do for you with little effort on your part, you'll realize what a waste of energy it is to even talk to women who don't show immediate and enthusiastic interest.",1334,0,1334,4qsfv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4qsfv7/once_you_realize_what_interested_women_will_do/,284,1467417176.0,"Ever go up to a woman on an approach and say, ""Hey, I saw you and I just want to talk""?

Here's some truth to brand into your flesh:

**Women don't want to just talk to men.**

They want to fuck, go on an adventure, be told what to do, get into a dangerous situation, start some shit, fuck up someone's day, save the world, ride on a motorcycle, see a movie, dance, sell shit on Etsy, cheat, stab you, eat mayonnaise, and run from a dinosaur.

But never be fooled into ever think a woman ever wants to *just talk*, ever. 

She has an agenda. You have an agenda. 

Either you're working toward hers or you're working toward your own. There is no middle ground.

So when a woman shows middling or low interest, you've picked a mountain to climb. You'll climb it her way in her time with small reward and with no respect from her. You'll sacrifice time, energy, and focus, as well as inflating the value of what little payment you'll receive for the trouble - so that at the end, you must also deal with the effects of having catered to self-delusion. This means emotional fallout, time for getting your shit back together, retooling, and rebuilding. You've fucked yourself.

When a woman shows intense and vested interest, you've already won. You can have whatever you want. You can have it now. She will eagerly give you as much as you can handle and more. You've claimed a gift that was yours since birth. By acknowledging and fulfilling her desire to fulfill your desires - without hesitation, without pussyfooting around, with confidence and a smile on your face - you've not done anything amazing. You've simply had a normal sexual interaction between a masculine male and a feminine female. It is an interaction that not many people understand anymore but that everyone craves.

To achieve this end, value quantity of women over quality. This is old hat to many of you, but newbies take note. There's an epiphany waiting for you, that moment when you realize a woman you've known for 30 seconds is willing to do more for you than that girl you chased for 6 years.

**Corollary**: Any woman you interact with for a long amount of time in a non-sexual manner (who isn't already head over heels for you), is not a woman you will ever sleep with. 


------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the math:

You're more likely to get open eager honest sexuality from a woman within minutes of meeting you than you are in 3 years of dancing around the subject. Be up front, be honest, and in a quick few seconds she'll tell you with words or body language all that you need to know about who is likely to get what, when, and how (the politics of getting your dick wet). That's minutes invested rather than years wasted.

To do that, stop masturbating and do something extremely intense daily. I know we say ""lifting."" It's a wonderful go-to and will open all new dimensions in your life but to be honest, anything shamelessly and no-fucks intense will work. A sport. A competition. A gig. Anything that becomes something more than the sum of its parts and that requires focused balls-on-fire intensity - do that thing every day.

When you're raging and intense and focused, you become a black hole of Fuck that women fall into naturally. You want them. You can't stop yourself, and women are walking sex toys to a man who can't stop himself.

If you've been jacking off a lot and dispersed your energy and middled your life by avoiding intensity, extreme action, and excitement, you will be static and background noise to anyone you meet.

So if you've been going out after 3 wanks to try to psych yourself up to talk to that girl who maybe kind of likes you, you've fucked yourself. She'll smell your ""kind of"" interest, return a ""kind of"" interest with just enough hope to keep you on the leash. You will use the leash later to hang yourself.

If you go out after a week of not cumming, women will look at you from across the room with hopeful and begging eyes. They will say things to you and not know why. They will agree to do the kinkiest most fucked up shit because they can see in your eyes that you *want it so goddamn badly*. They will feel your leadership and use all your commands as refreshing and simplifying direction in their too-many-choices what-am-I-doing pointless lives.

And they absolutely, certainly, posi-fucking-tively won't just want to talk.

Here is a list of 8 things that you can start doing if you want to get smarter. It's about time you started taking care of your brain.",1321,0,1321,7vtu7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/7vtu7c/taking_care_of_your_body_is_easy_you_keep_away/,157,1518009459.0,"##**Becoming a mental juggernaut**##

[**TL;DR: Animated Video Post**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l96-rIqWeYU&)

It’s easy to understand why people exercise their bodies. Your physical appearance is observed every day when you look in the mirror. Failure to take care of the body has obvious repercussions. The mind is different. Unlike the body, maintenance failure is not as obvious. So why would one wish to expand their mind in the first place?

Expanding your mind allows you to have a more comprehensive understanding of reality, which in turn better equips you with the resources you will need to achieve your goals and live a happier life. Knowledge is potential power, and potential power is better than having no power at all. Simply put, you will have more tools and be more informed which will allow you to make better decisions.


##**1. Hang out with insightful people**##
The easiest way to become more insightful is to hang around insightful people. You become like the people with whom you surround yourself. You might have noticed that overweight parents tend to have overweight kids, or that athletic parents tend to have athletic kids. In many cases, the people with whom we often associate with are responsible for many of the beliefs and values that we uphold.

If the most insightful things your friends have to say have to do with ‘Game of Thrones’  fan theories, perhaps it’s time you start associating yourself with new people.  You need to hang out with people that will give you new perspectives and make you contemplate higher quality thoughts. You don’t have to get rid of your old friends, just find some new ones.

There has never been an easier time to find insightful people. Through the powers of the internet, you can find your clan with a simple Google search. These people tend to hang out in niche forums or in dedicated Facebook groups. If you really want to find them, you will!

##**2. Meditate**##

Meditation has been practiced in the East for thousands of years. The exercise is starting to gain more popularity in the West due to scientific backing and general open-mindedness.

There are many benefits that stem from meditation; some are more obvious than others. However, these benefits only become evident after you have made meditation a daily practice in your life. Just like in the gym you cannot expect to see a huge transformation in one week.

Some benefits include:

* Increased ability to focus
* Increased emotional stability
* Reduced stress
* Increased Gray Matter in the Brain [1]
 

Meditation allows you to observe your thoughts and choose which ones to follow. You will no longer be run by impulse. Consequently, you will become better at decision making. Meditation leads to the development of ‘meta-awareness’, which means being aware of your own awareness. Enhanced meta-awareness allows you to step outside yourself and to judge your actions as if you were an observer. This ability is critical for those who wish to expand their minds. In the pursuit of knowledge, one will be forced with the task of challenging their presumed beliefs and thought patterns. That is why meditation is essential.

**Tools for meditation:**

* Headspace app
* Guided Mediation videos on YouTube 

##**3. Listen to Audiobooks and Podcasts**##

If you are serious about expanding your mind, you will be an adherent of the ‘Kaizen’ philosophy. It’s Japanese for ‘continuous improvement’. We all have the same twenty-four hours in a day, but what separates us is how we spend that time.

You can learn almost anything with audiobooks and podcasts. You can download new information to your brain whilst doing everyday activities. I, personally, can get through and audiobook easily within 2-3 days. If I am consistent, that’s 2 books a week and over 100 books a year. Can you imagine how different your mind will be if you went through 100 books a year? You don’t even need to read that many books for your mind and perspectives to shift. Even 30 books is more than 90% of people would complete. Here are some activities you can do whilst listening to audiobooks:

* Commuting to work
* Vacuuming the house
* Cleaning your car
* Cleaning your dishes
* Walking the dog

There are plenty of opportunities throughout the day that will arise in which you can slip in an audiobook.

Podcasts are also good and have gained huge popularity over the past few years. The advantage of listening to a podcast is that they can cover specific topics that are normally difficult to research. Podcasts are a goldmine, and just like audiobooks can have the same influence on your mind.

**Tools for Audio:**

* Audible
* Itunes Podcasts (contains over 250,000 different stations)
* Soundcloud (contains amateur podcasts)
* YouTube 

##**4. Read Biographies**##

Imagine if you could sit down with some of the most influential people in history, and hear them tell you their life stories. Imagine if you could learn the lessons they have learned, or discover certain insights that they had. Well, this is possible with the aid of biographies, and more specifically autobiographies. You might never get a chance to talk to these people, but you can absorb their words. Biographies are incredibly useful in regards to expanding your mind because they allow you to consider different contexts.

The best thing about biographies is that they distill many of the lessons that would have been learned over a lifetime.  You will not receive the same amount of insight as the person who experienced the events, but you will gain knowledge.

You might never become a boxing legend, or blow hundreds of millions of dollars, but you can learn the lessons from Mike Tyson’s biography. You might not be a president who spent twenty-seven years in prison, but Nelson Mandela’s biography might have something to say about it. You didn’t win the Mr. Olympia, and you weren’t the terminator or governator. But Arnold Schwarzenegger was, and he wrote all about it.

You get the picture; there are many life lessons to be learned through reading biographies! So what are you waiting for?

**Tools for Biographies**

* Goodreads (Find ratings and top lists)
* Total Recall (Arnold Schwarzenegger’s biography, a personal favourite)
* Long Walk To Freedom  (Nelson Mandela’s biography, another favourite)

##**5. Watch Documentaries**##

I remember when I was a young man. I used to spend many hours a day watching documentaries. My favourite documentaries were ones that dealt with: Astronomy, Quantum Physics, classical physics, war history, wildlife, and crime investigation. I stopped the habit after the age of sixteen.  Last year during my Mechanical Engineering course I was tasked with choosing an elective subject. I decided to choose Astronomy because of my prior interest in the subject. To my surprise, much of the content discussed in the lectures, I had already learned as a teenager through documentaries! Topics such as: gravitational waves, black hole event horizons, the moons of Jupiter, supernova, and nebula formation, as well as the expanding universe seemed like common knowledge to me. Long story short, I ended up getting a high distinction for the class. I didn’t get the mark because of natural intelligence; instead I got it through the documentaries that I had enjoyed as a teenager.

Documentaries are a fun means to expand your mind, especially during your downtime! The good thing about them is that they don’t seem like work. Many people can’t stand reading because to them it seems like work, it reminds them of school. Documentaries offer an alternative to the usual means of education, and you can find some good quality information in them as well. You can watch a range of documentaries on YouTube as well as a number of online websites for free. Do not ignore this medium; I try to watch one every couple of days.

**Tools for documentaries**

* topdocumentaryfilms.com (watch documentaries for free)
* YouTube Playlists ( many free documentaries )
* IMBb Highest rated documentaries (a useful list)

##**6. Read Philosophy**##

Reading philosophy is easily one of the best ways to expand your mind. Philosophy is derived from Greek and means ‘love of wisdom’. If you love wisdom you will not ignore philosophy. Philosophy challenges you to question many things in your life through the use of reason. The capacity to reason is one of the special human endowments that distinguishes us from animals. If you wish to expand your mind, you must learn to reason and use critical thinking to gain clarity. Philosophical inquiry can lead you to entertain deeper thoughts than you have ever imagined. You might find yourself asking questions such as:

1. Is it worse to fail at something or never attempt it in the first place?
2. If I could change one thing about the world, what would it be?
3. To what extent do we shape our own destinies, and how much is down to fate?
4. Does nature shape our personalities more than nurture?
5. Should people care more about doing the right thing, or doing things right?
6. What single piece of advice should we offer to a newborn infant?
7. Where is the line between insanity and creativity?
8. What is true happiness?

Luckily for us, we can also read the ideas and conclusions made by some of the greatest thinkers who have ever lived. We can read philosophy from both the East and the West in order to form our own personal world view. I highly recommend you read philosophy if you are serious about expanding your mind.

**Tools for philosophy:**

* Philosophy in minutes (introductory book that summarises key concepts)
* The pig that wants to be eaten (fun philosophical conundrums)
* The Republic (classic text by Plato)
* Meditations (classic text by Marcus Aurelius)
* School of life Philosophy (a YouTube crash course in philosophy)

##**7. Learn a new language**##

Learning a new language is an extreme workout for the brain, it’s like running a couple of marathons and competing in a strongman competition straight after. Language is complex, and in often shapes how we see the world. Learning a new language forces you to learn new syntax structures, and a completely new vocabulary and way of describing the world. Research has shown people who are multilingual often:

* have higher general intelligence 
* are better at planning, prioritizing, and decision-making 
* have better focus, concentration and attention 
* have better memory and memorization skills, including better working memory 
* exhibit mental flexibility 

There are just so many benefits to learning a new language, and as society becomes more globalised you might be forced to learn a new one.

**Tools for language learning:**

openculture.com (free language lessons)
busuu.com (language lessons)

##**8. Learn programming**##

Programming, much like learning a new language, can be incredibly taxing on the brain. Steve Jobs famously said,

>“Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer… because it teaches you how to think.”

Programming requires a structured and logical way to thinking, much like mathematics. Programming is advanced program solving that requires you to break down complicated problems into smaller manageable pieces that can be tackled. This structured way of thinking can then be applied to real-world scenarios. Good programmers are good problem solvers, and as the world becomes more technologically advanced, individuals with these skills will be rewarded greatly. Programming also requires incredible persistence as well as creativity. This is because small errors in a line of code can ruin the functionality of the end product.  Programming develops grit due to the persistence needed for it. It has been said that a young Bill Gates (Before his billionaire days) would often code for twelve hours straight. Gates would often fall asleep on the keyboard, wake up and continue his coding.

Programming has never been easier to learn as there are many of online resources and communities that can help you. I personally like to use codeacademy.com as you can learn a range of languages from HTML to C++. Go and give coding a try!

**Tools for programming:**

* Codeacademy.com (learn to code online for free)
* MIT ‘Introduction to Computer Science and Programming’ (free online course)
* Codeschool.com  (paid courses)
* Khan Academy ‘Computer Programming’ (free online course)

##**The Bottom Line**##

Expanding your mind is not rocket science. There is one common denominator between everything that I have listed. Everything challenges your mind in some way. Anything can be used as a tool to expand your mind, as long as it involves you learning something new. This list is by no means exhaustive; there are many things that I have omitted for example:

playing chess or any other strategy game
learning a new musical instrument
learning cognitive biases and heuristics
building up your memory
It’s up to you to figure out which tools you will use. I hope this article has been of value to you. Go out there and expand your mind!

95,Our Appeal of the Quarantine to the Reddit Admin,1324,0,1324,9lcyio,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9lcyio/our_appeal_of_the_quarantine_to_the_reddit_admin/,213,1538696114.0,"As I mentioned, we are making the appeal process completely open because we believe there wouldn't be fair play if it was behind closed doors. Below is our appeal to the admin:

---

First, I would like to tell you that we’ve posted this entire appeal publicly and plan to post your replies as well. We strongly believe this system you have set up to be a kangaroo court and have evidence to support this notion. If you want to prove to us that you are going to treat this appeals process fairly then we welcome your responses to the contrary.

In your message to us regarding our quarantine, you offer an appeals process:

> In this case the quarantine was applied for the high degree of misogyny present in this subreddit.
>To be removed from quarantine, you may present an appeal here. The appeal should include a detailed accounting of changes to community moderation practices. (Appropriate changes may vary from community to community and could include techniques such as adding more moderators, replacing certain moderators, creating new rules, employing more aggressive auto-moderation tools, adjusting community styling, etc.) The appeal should also offer evidence of sustained, consistent enforcement of these changes over a period of at least one month, demonstrating meaningful community transformation.

You’ve presented us with no evidence for your accusation, simply an assertion of misogyny. And yet your prescription is to change and modify this undocumented problem, a very thinly veiled setup for failure. You know full well we cannot address concerns that have not been raised - Which makes this a kangaroo court by definition.

Your appeals process does not offer an opportunity to claim innocence, instead placing guilt into the default terms of appeal. 

But we reject your charges.

Our moderation team has gone to great length to ensure our members follow reddit’s terms of service. We see no terms in the [content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/) that we have violated. And yet you allege we have broken this unwritten policy. How is it that you expect moderators and community to follow such rules is beyond me. Perhaps it is because you prefer to keep all communities in the dark about the unwritten rules. Keep everybody guilty of some crime, and selectively enforce it upon those you disagree with.

> “Show me the man, I’ll show you the crime.” — Lavrenti Beria, secret police chief under Stalin

To me, this seems like an immeasurably bad way to run a social media site which depends on its users for long-term survival. Perhaps it’s not in your interest to ensure Reddit stays around. Maybe you’re using censorship and quarantines as a means to redirect discussion into the direction you prefer. Maybe you’re trying to sway an election? I don’t know, that’s above my pay grade.


Misogyny is a very nebulous term, one that I disagree with heartily. Many use it in places where somebody has been critical of women, but does that meet the criteria of hate? I think that’s a very high bar to meet. One way we can test your definition of misogyny is simply to see how you’ve applied these standards site-wide.


Let’s say I started a subreddit with a mission statement:


>R/UpsetFemales is a subreddit for mocking reddit's large, vocal, and hypocritical female population.

>Women have a right to dignity and to exist, but they don't have a right to be upset and uncomfortable whenever they're confronted with sexism issues.

Would this meet your definition of misogyny? 


Well, substitute the words “female” and “women” with white people and you’ve got yourself the sub /r/fragilewhiteredditor. And for some reason they’re not quarantined.


Now I’m sure you guys understand the implications of picking and choosing what completely legal ideas and topics are okay to discuss on reddit. When you choose to block off /r/theredpill and post an endorsement to your point of view (Michel Kimmel), you’re tacitly endorsing the points of view you’ve chosen not to censor – especially the ones that align with Michael Kimmel.


Hatred (by your definition) is okay as long as the target is against white people.


What about towards men? Here are some lovely sentiments floating around reddit that the reddit admin tacitly endorses by not censoring or quarantining:

 [“Sorry you're going through this. It's the patriarchy: men think they own women. That is a flat out fact.”]( http://archive.is/XHCdk)

 [“sorry boys but its true and yall need to be taught not to rape. You are a cancer on society.”]( http://archive.is/GpzTw)

 [“I still see so many people say that ""All men are rapists"" This is a factually accurate statement expressing that men are socialized as both heterosexual and weapons against women and so typically have sex relationships that are not consensual in a fully self-actualized sense.”]( http://archive.is/e78kL)

[“I’m a misandrist, but I don’t want to be”](http://archive.is/N2lXY)

So it is clear, you tacitly endorse these positions if they are not quarantined as well.


To make matters worse, when you quarantined us, you put up a message directing our users to  Stony Brook University Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities whose executive director is Michael Kimmel.  The same Michael Kimmel who [denies male abuse victims](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9jypns/300000_subscribers_the_reddit_administration/). I see since then you’ve had the presence of mind to remove it- but without so much as an apology to our community of men who had to witness this. I would absolutely hate to know that the well being of abuse victims on /r/theredpill have been affected, or worse- hurt, by this event.


What would happen if the admin posted a message at the top of TWOX claiming that women’s abuse isn’t nearly as high as reported and that men’s abuse was much worse? Well, I’m pretty sure you’d call that misogyny.


So what’s it called when you do it to men? (It’s called misandry.)





We know the quarantine process isn’t simply about keeping the front page clear of controversial topics. There’s literal [shit porn]( https://old.reddit.com/r/scatporn), [women getting pissed on](https://old.reddit.com/r/watersports/), and [detailed rape fantasies](https://old.reddit.com/r/rapefantasies/) which have gotten the pass from your administration. Looks like you guys just love shit, piss, and rape. 

Meanwhile the content on TRP has helped thousands (if not more) of men find an identity and the strength needed to get back on the horse after terrible events like breakups, divorces, or false rape accusations. For some, they believe TRP literally [saved](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1prsqs/trp_knowledge_saved_my_life/) [their](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2dhqoh/trp_saved_my_life/) [lives]( https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5daq79/red_pill_saved_my_life/). Some of whom could easily have ended up [dead](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4il5of/close_friend_committed_suicide_after_falling/).

Look, you could have asked us to remove ourselves from /r/all, and we would have complied. But the quarantine makes things much worse. Mobile users see a message that we’ve gone private, causing our modmail to get literally hundreds of messages asking for access, completely halting actual mod functions. Members who have already subscribed are having a hard time finding us. It is clear that your goal with quarantine was to put as much into place as possible to make us fail, all while not actually pulling the trigger on an outright ban, because you know full well we keep the user base in check and do not allow rule breaking.


But I’m willing to give you guys the benefit of the doubt. Let’s say all of my well documented and evidenced accusations are simply wrong. Let’s say you really are just trying to make reddit a nice beige happy-land for new users and advertisers, and your goal was not to tacitly endorse all the hatred on the internet that you have chosen not to censor. I am willing to propose a compromise.


Remove the quarantine, and we will select the option to prevent being seen from /r/all. This has a lot of benefits. First of all, you won’t be tacitly endorsing every bit of hate on reddit because you’re no longer picking sides. But most importantly, your users will see the admin team actually applies rules in a balanced and fair manner, gaining you a level of respect that, let’s face it, Ellen Pao did a good job eroding.


We would be happy to comply with reasonable requests that help you with your advertisers and future IPO. We aren’t your enemy. The way you’ve gone about this was a big mistake and I think we can both agree on that. Let’s work together to move past this event and get the admin and users back on the same side for the benefit of reddit.

96,One of those days.,1321,0,1321,8pm17w,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/8pm17w/one_of_those_days/,173,1528509322.0,"I met this girl in the library. English, brunette, small and very cute. Pretty face.
It's exam time and everyone's been pulling all nighters or staying up late. We were in a computer room that was pretty empty, and she kept glancing over. I saw that we were studying the same thing.

We 'studied' like that for a while but actually I was just on reddit and she was playing some kind of RPG on her mobile. It was hot.

So I walked over because she was cute as hell and approach anxiety doesn't even register anymore and as soon as she saw me her eyes lit up and then she knocked her coffee over her computer keyboard. Lol.

We studied together for a while, (we had taken the same module,) answered some exam questions, flirted quite heavily and then decided to head off because it was late. She was very cute and smiley and seemed to be enjoying herself a lot.

It was like 2am or something, she lived in the halls close by, I lived far away. I decided to walk her back to her halls, because, you know, it was 2am. She was happy about it.

We walk in the night and she brags to me about how her IQ is 170 and she's in mensa and I'm like ""whowh this girl is into me huh.""

I see her off at the front gates and then go to head home, but not wanting to pass up a sure thing, I say to her ""we should study together again, that was fun"".

She gives me her number eagerly.
___________________________

Skip to a few days later. 

I wake around 1pm to a headache, ass taste and a dry throat. Pulled an all nighter for an exam the day before and my recovery sleep seemed to have run over deep into the next day. Oops. Gotta make up for that sleep debt I guess.

The first thing I do is drink some water, take a piss, brush my damn teeth and then check my phone and see the message;

""Omw""

Oh it's the girl.

She's on her way.

On her way where?

Shit, yeah. We were 'hanging out' today. Supposed to meet at 1.30.

I check the time. Shit.

I am not ready. And I will be late.

How long can I make her wait?... Well this is directly correlated to the attractiveness of the girl. 

In this case, not very long.

I get a move on.

The house is a tip, and I anticipate maybe possibly potentially hopefully fucking this girl after, so I can't bring her back to a shithole can I?

I begin cleaning the house: airing out the smoke, beer cans, food wrappers, trading cards. Soon I have a substantial rubbish bag and am not gonna let it stink up the flat. I put on my trusty slippers, put the door on latch and head downstairs.

I head out the main downstairs door and deposit the rubbish bag in the bin and attempt to re-enter through the front door.

But I've only gone and done it haven't I.

I've locked myself out.
__________________________________________

The first thing I did was buzz the neighbours. No need to panic yet. It's the downstairs front door that's locked, the door to my flat is on latch. They only need to buzz me in and I have access.

But no one was answering. I only have 2 neighbours, the cute Asian girl that lives across from me, and a European couple above. Whenever I bring over screamers they try to match us. It's pretty fun actually.

Poor asian girl though...

Anyway she wasn't answering. And neither was the couple. Well fuck they were probably at work. Of course. Real adults have real jobs and don't sleep in until 1pm to 'study'.

I weigh up my options and variables.

I should be at the library with this girl in 20 mins.

I am, quite literally, in the clothes I slept in. Luckily for me, that entails a thick hoodie and sweats, because I save money on heating and pyjamas are for fags.

Oh and my slippers of course. However, no phone, no keys, no wallet. No current way to enter the house.

I consider scaling the building, I'm a climber... but no parkour maniac. And I don't think I was stupid enough to leave any windows open.

Fuck. I realise that this date isn't gonna happen. I'm stuck outside, completely technologically naked, with no way to contact anyone.

Missing phone anxiety begins to creep in. 

Gonna have to flake on the girl, cos I'm a damn idiot and locked myself out of the flat. A silent flake too... harsh.

Oh well. She'll probably like me more after anyway.
________________________________________________
So I decide the smartest thing to do is wait for my neighbours to get back.

Which will probably be like 6 or 7 right? That's when normal people finish their normal jobs right?

Well until then I guess I just gotta kill time.

A few years ago, I woulda stressed about a situation like this, really just got stupidly anxious. But I've read Solzhenitsyn... this... this is no big deal at all. Pretty funny actually. 

Lets make the most of it.

So I wonder down the high street in my slippers, and get looks from the people on the street. I probably look like a mess, unshowered and unshaven and in my sweats; but then I see my reflection in a shop window and I've got that whole just woke up bed-head grizzled college boy stoner look going on and I marvel for the 1000th time at how attractive I am. Thank god for lifting.

The slippers flop on the pavement, they probably will not last the day if I'm gonna be walking around. But oh well. I remember buying these slippers. Only a few weeks ago. I was in a store and I spotted them and immediately felt this ethereal feeling like they were important somehow and I needed them. The slippers damn called to me. So I bought em.

Interesting. Now I know why. Morphic Resonance after all. Or maybe just very good slipper marketing.

I sit on a bench by the river and watch the water. It's a cold day. I feel naked and unplugged, and for the first time, actually feel good about it. I had no phone or money, no internet connection, no dopamine inducing distractions, and I was alone with my thoughts and the cold air. A sudden weight lifted from the top of my head. It felt like I'd just taken a small dose of... something....

It was freeing. I realised it was going to be one of those days. I haven't had one of these in a while, and I cherish them.
_____________________________________________________
It now has to be past the time when I was supposed to meet the girl but I have no real way to tell. I meditate for a while cos the air feels good on my face and then people-watch in the park and pet a dog. I begin listing off places to visit and planning out how I'll spend the next 5 or so hours until my neighbours get back.

It's as I am walking up the highstreet that I find what I thought was an extinct species of store.

An internet cafe.

An oasis.

Shit. Pass the tourniquet I have access again.

The Pakistani guy at the desks sees me in my slippers.

""I've locked myself out. I have no money. Can I use your computer please?""

He looks at me. ""Ok. Number 5"".

Thanks bro.

I get on facebook and its 2:05 and i notice she hasnt messaged me yet. Playing it cool. Nice.

I scroll reddit and memes for a while.

Then I have an idea.

I google the number of my estate agent. They should have a spare set of keys right? Paki bro let me use his phone to call them.

The lady on the other side didn't seem happy with my shit. They couldn't help me.

Plan foiled. Waiting for the neighbours it is then.

I scroll through trp for a while. The old hambeast next to me is watching some african music video and breathing very loudly through her mouth, and she's scrolling back and watching the same 10 seconds over and over. Has been doing it the whole time.

I finally get a ""?"" From the girl.

Nice. Still playing it cool.

I make her wait for 5 mins then hit her with the:

""cant come sorry""

She says ""why""

I start to think about what I should do. But I know immediately what I'm going to do. It's one of those days after all, and I want her along for the ride.

""you could come here though""

She waits a long time before saying ""where""

I message her the name of the nearest train station. She says ""why though?"" I tell her ""lol its a surprise "".

This was obviously too much for her to bear and she texted ""ok lol coming""

Wow that worked. Maybe I have her hooked already, or maybe she's just an adventurous one. Both options are great.

I didn't really have a plan for what happens next though. But who cares, I'll make it up as I go along.

Without my phone, or my wallet, I was entirely free to just drift with no responsibilities. It felt amazing.

Frankly, it felt like I was a kid again. Playing outside during summer.

I was suddenly very excited to see her.
___________________________________________
When she arrived at the station and saw me in my slippers she gave me the goofiest smile. I could see in her eyes that she knew immediately that it will be one of those days.

""I locked myself out"" I said.

""How?!?"" She's laughing.

So I tell her the story, as we walk around town. I'm very self conscious that my breath might be bad due to the fact I actually haven't eaten anything yet, but am also thankful I am OCD about brushing my teeth as soon as I wake up.

I didn't really think about gaming her at all, I didn't analyse anything or hyperfocus on my actions. I just kinda went with it. It was fun, I was completely in the moment and just ran around the town and played with her, like a boy dog with a girl dog following him around.
It helps that she wasn't shit testing me or anything bitchy like that, made it so easy and she happily bounced along like a lil' sidekick.

Well we try my flat again but my neighbours still aren't in, obviously, so we sit on the doorstep. I ask her if she wants to study. So we study on the doorstep for a while.

""Wait when do you have to be home?"" I ask her.

""Uh, anytime."" She smiles back.

""Cos I have no idea how long it will be till my neighbours get back. You don't have to wait with me the whole time you know""

""No I like it this is fun""

Wow. What a great feeling. When a pretty girl genuinely wants your company.
______________________________________

We chat for a while and quiz each other on metabolic pathways and then decide to wander again.

I climb a tree and then we talk about our families. I feel like a kid hanging out with his middle school girlfriend after school.

Eventually we spot a McDonalds.

So we go in. I haven't had breakfast, or eaten in hours. Fuck if I'm losing gains.

""So you know I don't have my wallet right?""

So she gets us a chicken nugget sharebox and sprites and we blow the straw packets at each other. Then we have ice cream.

We wonder by the park for a bit and it's getting colder so we head to a sports department store and check out all the cool bikes and skiing and climbing gear and I tell her I'll take her bouldering some time and she's down.

We leave and I reveal I've stolen a tennis ball and she gets mad at me becuase stealing is bad and scolds me so I keep bouncing the ball at her until she backs off and laughs and we play catch and she cant throw for shit and its cute.

The whole time, everything felt right. Like we'd been friends for ages, and we were on an adventure together.

We hit up a supermarket because I'm getting hungry again and we buy ham and dark chocolate and tangerines, and a jar of pickles. I wanted to get salted pistachios and mentioned it but the pistachios were very expensive and she was paying so... This time though we had a security guard following us around. For good reason too, I was still traipsing around in my slippers, which were muddy and beginning to fall apart. Probably looked like we were on drugs.

She pays again and I mentally add the tab up in my head with the nuggets. As we leave the guard says to us ""scuse me did ya pay for those"" and I say ""why would we steal pickles mate"" and she waves the receipt at him and gives him that Stacey disgust sneer that we've all sadly been on the receiving end of. It was astounding watching the pretty girl face morph into ultimate bitch putdown mode. There are probably betas in her life who only ever know her as this.

But hey I get to experience the cute, dorky side of her, and I'm loving it.

______________

We leave the supermarket and she reveals that she actually stole the pistachios and hid them in her purse and I hug her cos I'm proud and squeeze her ass and then we eat our meal in the park.

After the meal we lay together on the grass for a while and I give the tennis ball to a dog that tried to steal our food and then we attempt the neighbours again but still nothing and its like 6pm and I'm starting to get a bit irked.

It's beginning to get cold now and I'm afraid the girl is getting bored of me and also that my neighbours might just have gone away for ever and I don't wanna have to call a locksmith but soon it will be late. I decide to take her to the one place in town I haven't taken her to yet.

Paki bro is cool again with us using the computers, and so we browse memes together for a while, and the hambeast is still there literally doing the same thing as before. She tells me about rick and morty but I don't really like rick and morty but I pretend its cool anyway cos why not and then I show her reddit and she doesn't really get it and then I tell her 9/11 was an inside job and we spend the next 2 hours arguing over conspiracy theories.

I make 4 journeys to check on the neighbours in the meantime and my slippers are broken and flapping at this point and its fucking almost 9pm and no one is home yet. I really don't want to have to do the lame and expensive option of getting a locksmith but its getting increasingly likely. What if my neighbours were just away? I hadn't heard them banging in a while tbh...

Everytime I get back to the cafe she is slouched there scrolling instagram and she hasn't left yet and its dark now and the cafe has got that dingy yellow light grimeyness to it and with the pretty bored girl sitting there and the ambience it looked like a damn Hopper painting and that snapshot remains imprinted in my mind. Really nice.

I tell her no one is stopping her from going home as it's getting late.

She says she feels bad for me and wants to see me get tucked in bed nice and warm.

Sweet

________________________

At 9 pm I break and realise my neighbours probably aren't coming back tonight and it was just my luck (or providence) that I got locked out today. I decide to go for the last resort and call up a locksmith using the girls phone. I'm bit grumpy about it but also got shit to do tomorrow.

>""I only have 1 door I'm locked out of how much and how long?""

The lady on the other side said £70. Reasonable. 40mins.... Sure.

But first I have to run it by the girl.

>""You're not broke are you?""

>""Why""

>""I need 70 for the locksmith""

>""Sure"" she says

>""Okay please come immediately"" I tell the lady.

We leave and I attempt to give the internet cafe guy £10 of her money as a gesture of thanks but he's not having it and seems more invested in the asian tv show he's watching anyway.

So we go to the ATM so she can withdraw the cash and then return to the doorstep to wait for the locksmith.

It seems locksmiths and drug dealers have a lot in common. They always seem to be '20 more minutes"".
__________________________

After 80 mins the girl starts yawning and I begin to shiver cos it's cold and she cuddles up to me. I call again and basically shout at the lady on the phone to hurry up and also to give me a discount. She says 10%. I say that's not enough and I wanted 20. She said 'ok ok'.

I can feel myself getting hot angry at the whole situation now but I catch myself cos I know its stupid and I don't wanna break frame in front of the girl.

So finally, after 90 mins the guy arrives and I think its gonna be a simple affair but nope, life ain't that easy.
___________________________
**Final Boss**

So this guy shows up and he's eyeing me up oddly and eyefucking the pretty girl. He asks what needs opening.

I show him the front door and the top latch lock that just needs to be picked or whatever, I actually have no idea how locksmiths operate but I'm sure he's had this a million times before.

He gives me a 'hmmm' and a 'haaa' and says ""well it looks like I'm gonna have to drill it""

That sounds expensive.

>  ""Drill it? Is there nothing else you can do?""
> 
>  ""No I'm gonna have to remove the lock and install a new one""
> 
>   ""Does that mean new keys and shit?""
> 
>   ""Yeah I'm afraid so""
> 
>   ""Hey man I don't wanna bother my neighbours just cos I'm an idiot, you sure there's no other way you can try?""
> 
>   ""No this happens all the time only way is to drill it out"" he seems pretty sure of himself.
> 
>   ""Nah dude I'm not gonna pay for that"".

It's got a bit tense because we both realise neither of us is willing to back down yet. The girl can feel the animosity between us but she seems to know her place and doesn't say anything.

The frame battle continues.

I weigh up my options. I need to get in. This guy wants to rob me. I could get a new locksmith, that means another 90 mins probably, and maybe another scumbag. Fuck that I want to get inside now.

Then I think back to one of the first lessons I learned when i stumbled across this subreddit.

**""Your greatest power as a man is your ability to walk away"".**

I smile.

> ""Okay dude cool I'm not gonna inconvenience my neighbours, will figure out how to get in tomorrow""

> I ask the girl ""hey, can we go back to your place tonight?

> She's surprised but says ""sure of course"".

> ""Cool that's sorted then, sorry dude I'm just a broke student you know haha""

I see the panic of a lost sale in his eyes, he realises that I'm not bluffing.

But I give him an opening. In truth, I actually want this damn door open. You must always give them an opening to backtrack, it helps them save face. 
> 
> ""Could you just give it one last look though just to make sure?""
> 
> ""You know what mate, let me try something"" he says, as he rummages in his van.

Of fucking course. You go for it *mate*. You try something *mate*.

Bastard.
_______________________________

So he grabs this long hook claw thingy and feeds it through the letter box and opens the door in 4 seconds flat and I wanna bash his fucking head in but mostly I'm just glad that we're finally inside and it's warm and also victory tastes sweet cos absolutely fuck this guy. Don't blame him that much tbh, most people are weak and agreeable and probably fall for this one all the fucking time, but that's still such an asshole way to do business. 

So she hands me the cash but I give her 20 back and she has a £5 note and so I give him the £55 (for 5 mins worth of work not bad bro) and he says

>""Its 70 mate""

I get a hot flash of anger. Wow. Round 2 it is.

>""Your boss gave me 20% off for being late""

>""I wasn't told anything about that"" he says.

>""Well she did""

He pauses for a moment. Still holding the money. I can feel the girl get more anxious. We're inside now and the silence makes the tension worse.

> I'm pissed. ""Whether she told you or not you still owe me a discount you were very late""

He smiles. It's a good shit eating smirk, ladies must like it.

>""Okay but its 56.""

This guy must be joking.

The hot anger cools into a shrewd sharp chill as I realise.

Fuck this guy. I know exactly what he's doing. If he's not gonna get his cash, he'll at least try and make me sperg out and break frame in front of the girl. Petty but effective, cant allow me to win too hard can he?

I give them both a smile. ""Do you have a pound babe?"" I ask her. She doesn't. So I go upstairs and grab a pound from my loose change. It feels great to be back in my home again. I also clean up a bit more and fabreeze. Lol.

Probably should not have left her downstairs alone with the asshole, but I get back down and he hasn't cucked me so I put the coin straight into his palm.

""Okay we're done you can go now""

He seems pleased with himself and leaves.

__________

We get upstairs and I put the radiators on, down a glass of water and stare at myself in the bathroom mirror for a while to try to dissipate the anger. Such a great day and one guy's gotta be an asshole and ruin it.

Then I realise that I don't have to think about it that way and actually I just smashed through a significant confrontation that I would have failed miserably years ago. This is the kind of shit Dads train you for and I never had a Dad but shit, I managed to do it. They say TRP is just for picking up women but honestly it's so much more; this place taught me how to hold frame and power-talk and navigate confrontations like this. Beforehand I would have been an agreeable pussy and bent over for the guy.

And the day had been fucking great too. A day disconnected from responsibilities and exams and social media. A day free of anxiety, where I could just flow in the moment and mess around with a cute girl like I did when I was a kid... And had I never even spoke to the girl, had I pussied out in that one pivotal moment in the library, this day would never have happened.

Always approach guys, you never know where the story with that girl will go, and pussying out kills the story before it even gets to start. Regret is always worse than rejection.

As I think about this I give myself shivers and am proud, and then smile in the mirror like a fucking psycho and scare myself.... but then realise its not that bad and I can smile when I'm proud if I want it's no big deal.

I enter the living room and she's taken off her coat and shoes and looks at me warmly and says ""you have a nice place"" and I say 'thanks' and then she immediately and very eagerly begins removing my clothes.
_______

**Epilogue**
_________

The next morning we cook breakfast and I'm head chef and she's like my nurse handing me scalpels and shit and its fun to boss her around and she follows my instructions. Afterwards I walk her to the high street to see her off. At the ATM I withdraw all the money from the tab I racked up yesterday and pay it all back immediately. Then I kiss her off at the station.

I feel pretty darn great about myself and basically skip home and jump into bed and just take some time to process things now that I'm finally alone.

The whole of yesterday was amazing, and I learnt so much about myself. All it took was some damn disconnection from life for a while.

I consider trashing my phone and getting a brick. Could I make the leap? Probably a good fucking idea. We know now that Zuck is listening to everything we say, and I'm trying to avoid getting on more lists than the many I'm already on.

Then I think about the girl, and just how lovely and sweet she was to be around. It was like she energised and supported me, gave me the life and exuberance I was missing. I suddenly really wanted to see her again, and felt the first few hints of one-itis settle in... She was so nice and feminine and smart and loyal and had the whole girl next door ""would never cheat on u"" vibe going. Hey, if we were a couple this would be a great origin story to tell people... I wonder what our kids would look like...

I settle for going on facebook to look at her pictures and miss how pretty she is.

I click on her profile pic which is very demure and innocent and makes her look smart and then I see it instantly.

>""In a relationship with""

Lol. Why did I get my hopes up. What was I expecting.

AWALT after all.

I have my own subreddit. Link in my profile. ",2018-06-09 01:55:22
97,"How I accepted that I was using weed everyday as an escape from my own inner problems for 2 years now. And how I tackled my anxiety with meditation, exercise, and mindfulness.",1316,0,1316,62zuwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/62zuwd/how_i_accepted_that_i_was_using_weed_everyday_as/,197,1491171546.0,"I pretty much a daily smoker for the past 2 years. For most of this duration, I told myself I smoke to feel good. I also believed I smoked to get creative, be musical, and sometimes even social. No matter how bad it got, I saw that weed was a good influence on my life. 

But the fantasy came crashing down 2 weeks ago. I had begun to notice for the first time how my thoughts haunted me. It began when I noticed my thoughts actually snowball as my day goes on, growing more and more powerful, thinking of this and that, constantly fretting about the past or future. I didn't think much of it at first, having lived with this sort of mind for a long time now. But that day, I read a quote on Reddit that triggered a different response. 

**""Living in the past causes depression. Living in the future causes anxiety.""**

At that moment, I understood the reason behind my addiction to weed. I was using weed to stop thinking about the past and future and live in the moment. For when I smoke weed, I relax because nothing else matters but the *now*. 

From there, I knew what I had to do. I had to tackle my issue from the root cause. My thoughts were out of control, pushing me to anxiety and depression. So I searched for information and found the concept of **immersion**. Immersion is when you are completely into an experience that you think of nothing else as you experience it. For instance, video games with high immersion levels captivate you for hours on end. I found relaxation in video games because of my immersion. 

So I thought if I were to be immersed in what I am doing, regardless of what activity it is, I can be relaxed at all times! I can be the most comfortable person at any place in the world if I was truly immersed in the environment and people I interact with!

I found that millions of people were already practicing immersion in everyday life by meditating. So I sat down in my candlelit room and I said out loud, ""there is no past, no history, no future, only now. I am. I am."" as i began my session. I didn't time my session. I would stop meditating when my mind is clear from thoughts about the past and future. At first, i would catch myself throughout the day as my thoughts would spin out of control and just meditate. It didn't matter if I was outside or hanging with friends, I would close my eyes and repeat that line. Calmness would pass through my body, relaxing my face and body. Then I would carry on with whatever I was doing. 

On top of that, I found that exercise helped tremendously with calming my mind. Exercise in itself is an immersive experience. You're there, with your body, pushing it and pushing it like nothing in the world matters. And when you come out, your brain chemistry is pushing you towards positivity. I see the gym as another meditation room.

After all this, I've completely stopped relying on weed for relaxation. If I wasn't relaxed, I'd go to the gym or meditate. I became the most relaxed person at every venue I went to. It was to the point where I could sense who was anxious and who was calm.

Smoking itself feels different for me. I no longer think I am happier or more relaxed with weed. After all, I was already as relaxed as I can be. Merely, I would describe it as a different state of mind. 

I leave you with another quote: 

**""A man cannot control others if he cannot control himself""**

**TL;DR: OP stopped denying that he had an anxiety problem. OP accepted that his thoughts were controlling him. So OP practiced meditation and exercised daily to tackle the problem instead of smoking to delay it. Now OP does not smoke alone to escape anymore. ",2017-04-02 22:19:06
98,"""Why Do Girls Dump Their Boyfriends?"" An introduction to Generation-Z and whats to come",1313,0,1313,9cwa9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9cwa9p/why_do_girls_dump_their_boyfriends_an/,451,1536101325.0,"I recently went to a family gathering where my 17 year old cousin gave me a crash course in Gen Z. (the jury is still out on the name). This is the post millennial generation. I don't generally like to package things into neat little boxes but for the sake of the post let's go with it.

She was showing me some ""huge"" boxing match between two YouTube ""celebrities"". Apparently YouTube and Instagram personalities are replacing film and music stars as the the big draw cards, welcome to the virtual takeover.

While she was showing me this whole boxing match saga we stumbled on to this video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mmIEZKWi3A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mmIEZKWi3A) ""Why Do Girls Dump Their Boyfriends?""

The video shows some young fella interviewing Gen Z girls on a popular nightlife street in the US. Being a millennial myself and having endured a large part of my generation driving feminism to the heights we see today, I was still somewhat surprised by the state of affairs. It's a jungle out there to say the least and I pity the horde of programmed Soyboys coming off societies production line, that have to co-exist with these Vag-Lords. I can only hope that one day they may stumble upon a Sub such as this to (reluctantly) liberate themselves from the tyranny of a gynocentric haven.

The video starts out with the Interviewer asking young ""Living my best life"" thots why girls dump their boyfriends. I think their inebriated state assists in the truth they spit when answering the question, but their answers point to a much larger, gloomier problem for young men growing up today.

The glaringly obvious thread that ran through most of the answers was how men have become needy bitches, and  woman just can't stand it. Ultimately the feminization of men as a whole.

In the intro one of the girls proudly boasts:

>*Her: Every guy I've broken up with has threatened to kill himself*

As if it's just another feather in her cap. This is a far cry from the prehistoric days where a woman losing a man was a tragedy, like she had just lost her meal ticket(because she had). Or the stereotype of a woman sobbing at the loss of her beau, but here we have poor Billyboy's employing the dramatic(typically feminine traits) in an obscene display of oneities. Threatening to trade his own life for a c-grade clam in an attempt to negotiate attraction. She looks truly moved.

The same girl later on goes on to complain that:

>Her: *I make em comfortable and they cheat on me  \*and then shakes her ass at the camera\**

It's truly a riddle as to why they struggle to settle with such a wholesome princess.

The next girl tells a tale of how she's dumped every boyfriend she's ever had with a snide look of accomplishment. She goes on to say the reason she dumped them:

>*Her: They were all way more obsessed with me than I was with them, It was gross.*  
>  
>I*nterviewer: They probably wanna share their feelings with you?*  
>  
>*Her: Yeah, it's like stop, I don't wanna hear that*

It seems our dames are more in tune with their sexual nature than ever, and why wouldn't they be, feminism has given them the platform to express it as freely as possible. Note the disgust a woman has for a low value man who hands himself over to a woman, she simply cannot harbor feelings for such a needy scrap of filth.

The BP notion of share your feelings and showing how much you care quite literally repels women. She goes on to say...

>*Her: I don't wanna see you all the time, maybe twice a week, don't be obsessed with me, thats disgusting. Let me go out, let me wear whatever the fuck I want.*  
>  
>*Interviewer: And If I happen to make out with someone..*  
>  
>*Her: Who cares, it was a slip up, shit happens.*

Translation, be my little bitch, get comfy in my frame, I'm gonna go shop at the meat market as much as I want and If a sausage happens to land in my mouth, well then oh well shit happens.

More concerning is the mentality of these women. Our gynocentric oasis of a civilization has literally drilled into these princesses the entitlement that men exist to serve women. Funny, I've heard that one somewhere?....oh yeah, feminism used to say that about men. The script has well and truly flipped.

Lastly she goes on to say:

>*Interviewer: Men should focus on building themselves?*  
>  
>*Her: Yeah, you gotta be 100% good with yourself, you confident with yourself before you get a girl.*

It's gotten to the point that women are literally starting to tell men how to be men. Just be yourself, women will love you for who you are is the most cancerous statement for a young man to hear.

The next girl drops ancient wisdom:

>*Interviewer: Do you have a friend you keep in the friend zone to buy you dinner, but then you hit up another dude when you wanna get real?*  
>  
>*Her: Yeah, thats exactly how it goes*

The joke is, you don't even need the Red Pill to tell you this anymore, men have become such worthless rags that woman will boast about using them an interview. This is normal Gen Z behavior, it serves women, so why would we expect anything else? Woman are so aware of blue pill nature, and will milk it for everything it's worth. Don't be the butt of this joke.

Then an HB6 goddess adds:

>*Her: He was telling me he loves me, and I didn't like him, so I had to cut it off*

The same guy who comes on here: ""But you guys over at the Red Pill are such mean woman haters, you don't know what love is all about"", while he drowns his sorrows in a masturbation binge.

The hypergamy bunny chimes in:

>*Interviewer: Do you think the grass is always greener?*  
>  
>*Her: Yeah, always*

While society shouts from the sidelines: ""You go girl, you can do better, that man don't deserve a princess like you""

Then our self aware hood rat brings some sense to all this:

>*Her: It stresses me out because WTF, this guy is giving me attention, why can't I love him?*  
>  
>*Interviewer: But then theres that guy who like spit on you at the bar...*  
>  
>*Her: Yeah and then it's like hit me up*

It's called AF/BB sweetheart. You get the tingles for the alpha, and the beta's dry your cooch faster than a Sub-Saharan summer. They're quite aware aware of this dynamic, do they care? No.

Last one is my favorite, this little meatball barks into the camera with a cigarette dangling out her hand that men need to:

>*Her: Workout, go swimming, take her for a walk, take her for dinner, have sex, I don't know just stop playing video games*

Telling of her desires for an alpha man, every word dripping with entitlement as her stomach hangs out, and lungs fill up with tar. She does however do a great job of telling men how to be men again I'll give her that.

Now these woman will almost certainly ride the carousel with vigor for the next decade or so and then splat against the wall with ravaged lady bits. I pity the poor blue pill save a ho that offers them a ladder to climb it, but I have no doubt that this generation of white knights will be lining up for the opportunity.

They'll do that because these women are not the exceptions, they are a representation of the attitude of the median woman coming off the Gen Z production line, and the median man coming off it is the most feminized schmuck in history. Every one of these responses drip with feminine superiority, repulsed by the needy, clingy devoid of Alpha trait males. With masculine traits labelled as ""toxic"" it's no wonder these men they speak of are so lost. A portion of the millennial's held this notion but the vast majority of Gen Z is more widely infected with it than ever before.

**The Nett result:** A generation of men behaving more feminine than ever, society filtering the presence of (toxic)masculinity. With men adopting a feminine approach we get females behaving more masculine than ever to fill the man void.

**Why is operating society on feminine empowerment values a problem?**

Well as packaged so nicely in a CH post. Men compete, then cooperate. Women compete, then cast out.

*Vertical male hierarchy ensures a place for everyone. Order is kept via rules-based discipline and the threat of demotion. Allows for graceful losing and peaceful surrender. Stable.*

*Horizontal female hierarchy causes massive churn, clique formation, uncertain and shifting status and frequent change of allegiance. Zero sum. Highly unstable.*

Try and Imagine an interview like the one above being conducted 80 years ago, under a male dominated society, women would quiver to address men in such a manner on a public platform.

**So lets just go back?**

Well for starters those banking on a return of the TradCon Values should jump ship now or alternatively learn how to navigate the current climate. No amount of Jordan Peterson videos is going to change the course of modern culture back to their TradCon paradise. Society is galloping away from TradCon values and not looking back(well besides the hopeful BP idealists doing the ostrich).

**Why wont a reversal work?**

This is a really complex multifaceted issue that would take a lot longer than this post is intended to be to really get stuck into, but as a brief introduction, conservative values wont work today because of the same reason they did work. Faith. The breakdown of a faith driven community(or even nationalism) tribalism approach to a more secular diverse globalism approach.

Faith was the glue that held conservative values together. There was a man in the sky watching over every woman's behavior. If she wanted to be in prime alpha selecting position she had to be a good, faith holding woman. Behavior swaying too far from the doctrine was condemned and shamed by society, no man would tolerate it.

Advancements in Science coupled with liberal dogma has left the institutions of marriage and religion more worthless than ever before. Many still hold onto faith for comfort but very few are internalizing that there is truly a deity watching over us and judging our behavior. I can count a total of zero people I know who live by the prescribed doctrine, it's simply not compatible with modern society. The closest I've met is a married pair of Jehovah's Witnesses, they live a very TradCon life but only interact with Jehovah's Witnesses so as to not interfere with their faith.

This is why the most religious(or strong cultural influence) countries, still hold the most TradCon values. E.G Saudi Arabia, North Korea etc

**So where does that leave us now?**

Without gods to judge us and direct our lives, humans become the gods of their own lives. What do gods do? Well, whatever they want. Add in a few wars, women entering the workplace, contraceptive pills, feminine law protection, globalization, the internet, cellphones, welfare and we have a society where woman are as free as they've ever been. And what does a free woman do? Well sample every Alpha penis that lands in her snatch of course.

Gen Z cheers and pats them on the back: ""YOLO, strong independent woman!"" while the saddest and unhappiest generation of men and women unfold in our recorded history. Woman not satisfied with their newfound empowerment because It just so happens that woman don't really like behaving like men. Like every cohesive, natural selection driven species they still need and want men, and not men behaving like woman type of men, biologically alpha men, so that natural selection/biology can take place effectively.

Societal pressures have pushed both men and women to stray further and further from their biological nature. Men adopting more feminine traits, with woman becoming more career driven, providing for themselves, providing their own(or potential to) food and shelter, not settling down, not having kids. Compound this with women not having the consequence of having a baby after spreading her legs and it's opened up sexual promiscuity instead of strict selectiveness. The Alpha traits they would have selected for are labelled as toxic so they become more dormant in society than ever before. The less we are aligned socially with our biological nature the less happy we become.

I learnt from my cousin that she can't help but attract fuckboys. It appears that they are some of the last bastions of masculinity, now given a derogatory label in an attempt to shame Alpha behaviors. Her description of a fuckboy: *Gym guys who fuck, but don't ever commit*. It's truly one of lifes greatest riddles why they won't commit and settle with one vag in the greatest vag buffet in history. They're called called fuckboys because well, they fuck. And then all the ""nice guys"" of Gen Z offering commitment are the guys you heard about in our lovely short film.

**So what to do?**

No matter what direction we go in it will simply be another society, one we will need to learn to navigate all the same, so I'll open that discussion to the floor.

My last thought, TRP is going to be more relevant than ever with Gen Z. With a free and unregulated sexual market, it's the Alpha that is once again king. No more supposed one for one marriage, in a free market AF/BB is the order of the day. The Top 20% will be drowning in it while the remaining 80% go hungry, at least until they're established and even then they'll be picking from the post wall pool. It's like we've gone back to the principles that governed early man.

In the absence of stable women, plating is more relevant than ever. With the pussy buffet pumping, vetting is of paramount importance. With unregulated hypergamy a man needs to be outcome independent and willing to drop his treasured unicorn more than ever.

The market can still work for the individual, as long as he doesn't expect whats not being delivered and knows how to navigate the murky waters of the SMP that lies ahead.​",2018-09-04 22:48:45
99,Today was the day that Reddit almost swallowed the pill. On the front page today: Guy finds out soon-to-be fiancee is cheating and sets up an elaborate proposal to dump her.,1310,0,1310,3ui10w,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3ui10w/today_was_the_day_that_reddit_almost_swallowed/,441,1448682787.0,"**Tl;DR from the top comment itself:** Guy discovers his soon-to-be financee is cheating. Discovers texts and photos. Sets up elaborate proposal including candles, glitter, and rose petals. Has her read a rhyming poem that ends with him asking who the other guy is. She looks up shocked, he bails without a word, and gets into his car and drives off holding a pink dildo.

>Gotta love living in a culture where a man would deem it necessary to document that he didn't trash her house or beat her before he confronts her for being a cheating whore. Why do you suppose he felt the need to do that?

>Because a crying woman is better than actual evidence in western society. Go ahead, just google what happens when a woman gets violent and the cops show up.
Edit: I wonder how much downvotes I can lose by mentioning theredpill(Linked here) is about acknowledging this sort of shit for self-preservation.

1k+ upvotes despite the mention of the red pill sub-reddit?! What has the world even come to now! :(


**Backstory:** Decent guy. Goodlooking, fit, well groomed, smart, not a total beta finds out that his soon to be wife is actually a whore through her facebook account and stuff. She's been pretending to be in love and all the jazz but she's been fucking a guy called Thomas Roo behind his back.

She sends Thomas the same nude pics that she sends to her fiance . Fucks him. But hides it from the guy in the video. This guy even had requested her to just tell him to walk away if she wants to be with someone else. But no, she wants to keep the beta husband as well as the boy toy on the side. Guy feels devastated cuz of the sham she tried to pull off and plans to dump her shamefully and record that he has not done any physical harm to her or her house to protect himself from the police.

A sixteen minute video but well worth the watch and something everyone will be able to relate to on here. This setup is a few weeks after he realizes she's a whore. You will she the feeling of pure freedom and liberty when you see him escape out in the end and play the music in his car as he drives away.
