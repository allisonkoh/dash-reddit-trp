Edit: on awalt, I agree with it and what it entails, but generally ive found that all people are like that its just that men have given them the world and that was the mistake. The women of today are drunk on consumption, narcissism, and social power. In a sense they are nothing but shallow and materialistic hedonists. They have been sheltered from every form of hardship and are given handouts for doing nothing more than complaining.

If men were raised as women are I doubt we would be better than them.

Parties every weekend, not an iota of worry about debt piling up - as long as there is cash flow everything is fine, right? 

In brief, life used to be taken for granted without war, disease or famine happening for long:  the same way men are (dis)regarded by women after being accorded too much  comfort and security by modern civilization. 

Those men who are aware of being exploited in the name of relationships aka 'thats what men are supposed to do!' decided to stop supporting them and society has no clue about what is going to happen next. But that is none of our concern.

Looking back at a younger more inexperienced version of myself, I was bp beta, like I imagine a lot of you were before your awakening. In high school I was the funniest in my year, but if you saw a picture of me you'd know I had to be... I wasn't a great looking kid, not ugly, but on the lower end of average. I had a perfectly round head and my balls didn't drop till I was 17 so even if a girl did take an interest it's not like I could've progressed very much. 

Once I left school after a measly performance in classes I didn't like, to be honest that I only took because girls I fancied were in them, I got my first job as an apprentice administrator. £6.50 per hour - wooohooooo! I used to work with 4 of the most bitter women I have ever crossed paths with. I knew it wasn't going to work, and to be honest, it wasn't the kind of administration I had hoped for... I was thinking it'd be like Edward Snowden but it was more like Peggy Olson from madmen. But I worked, and worked, first in last to leave until a small dip in share price gave room for the ""last in first out"" schtick. 

I was 17, making the shittest amount of fucking money ever, barely had any friends, and was getting nowhere with girls. Nowhere. You know that Louie CK bit where he says ""I couldn't talk to women I'd just walk up and go cOuLd yOu FUCK mE?"" that's me. 

Fast forward to my 20th birthday (2015). I went on to YouTube and one of the suggestions was ""Bill Burr - Let it Go"". I've always been a massive comedy fan, and religiously watch specials so I thought, I'll give this no-name guy a try... wow, what an experience. This was peak Burr doing what he's good at, and being a fiery red head myself, thought I want to see more of this guy! So I looked him up, a couple of MMPC episodes later, and he's talking about this ""Patrice"" guy and how he had such game with women.. I'm like yeah right but if Burr finds him funny, maybe I'll like him too.

\*QUEUE EVERY OPIE AND ANTHONY CLIP EVER MADE WITH PATRICE, BLACK PHILLIP SHOW, ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, ALL LIVE SHOWS LATER\* 

I seriously consumed this guys content like it was heroin. Not only was he saying EVERYTHING I had to hear but he made it so authentically funny that it all resonated instantly. My anxiety about women seemed to melt and I felt like I had entered a new world. Patrice O'neal gave me my first ever red pill. 

I then had the confidence to phone up and demand an entry level position within a local 'sales' firm, I interviewed that same day, and had the offer by the next days lunch. 

I worked tirelessly. My hours were 8am - 5:30pm, but I'd usually stay until 8 most nights to get a jump on the next day. Thats where I met Nicole. I had some game now... I thought... and enough confidence to back up a swagger + I was good at the job and well respected by directors, so I had some situational clout. 

We went to the head office for training, and we fucked. Then when we got back, it carried on for some months till I left to go to a better firm for more money and better commission. By the time I was 22, I was making £5k a month, easily spending £3k on cocaine, hotel rooms, and nights out to impress more girls, finally I was getting the attention I always craved. 

One night out, I met this girl who would later become an LTR. This is already long so I'll spare you the whole story but she cheated and got pregnant to some chad, and like Patrice said, just walk away, so I did. She hit me for 3 months, I never went back. 

So feeling at an all time low, I started watching Patrice again. He used to have this guy on called Dante Niro, and I realised I had never really payed him any attention, so I searched him on Youtube and watched an interview with Sam Roberts, where he talks about a culture on reddit called the Red Pill and MGTOW communities. It peaked my interest, so I looked this up.

\*QUEUE READING EVERY FUCKING BOOK THOSE CUNTS HAVE EVER WRITTEN, MULTIPLE ROOSH HOURS, RED MAN GROUPS, ETC\*

Like it says in the book, lift, dress well, eat right, etc. So I did. The plan was never look like Dorian Yates or be as strong as Eddie Hall, but just to have a t-shirt fit right. Not too tight round the sleeve etc. After about 1 year of that, banging sluts, becoming totally teetotal, I was starting to have doubts over it. Im mean is all life is about to bang girls? Because that's getting pretty repetitive and for fuck sake is every girl this fucking boring?! REALLY?! YOU LIKE DOGGOS AND HATE TRUMP?! WOW!

So this was already on my mind, and then one night last week I watched the Red Man Group with Turd Flinging Monkey (I assume most of you know who he is). For context, the Red Man Group is supposed to be a group of the hard hitting red pillars within the community, and Donovan Sharpe. Rollo is there, Richard Cooper is there, Shawn Smith is there. TFM made them look like little boys. He totally schooled them all. His frame was bulletproof, and he was very calculated in everything he said. 

Donovan Sharpe that cuck fuck kept trying to bait him into saying ""oh I'm just a beta I can't get girls"" but TFM calmly explained that it's not too much effort - it just isn't worth it... and I agree. I have achieved nothing from banging sluts. I had a sense of emptiness and for what?! 10 minutes of sex and then a ""eh so we can maybe get drinks during the week or something"" or ""I got to go I have work"", why the fuck are they so destined to deny that ""the juice is worth the squeeze""? WHY?! it isn't! One of the 'godfathers' of the manosphere and probably the most prolific out of everyone, Roosh, has tapped out and found God and seems much happier!

TFM - you opened my eyes. Thank you.

I don’t really watch any of them at all, but I’ve heard of them as they are pretty big “stars” on the platform. Apparently this Kate girl that Carson was dating was essentially a nobody before she starting talking to him, and he started having her on his streams and such.

I believe roughly about a month ago Carson stopped uploading because he was extremely depressed. Then, just 1 or 2 days ago, the news came out that Kate had cheated on him with Fitz.

I don’t know about how anyone else sees this, but this is how I see it. Kate was a nobody who used Carson to get famous, then when Carson stopped uploading she realized her views and subscribers were going to drop as well. So she decided that she’s going to get with another big prominent Youtuber, Fitz! This will be an easy way to ensure that her views stay up and she stays relevant. She got a taste of the good life, and now she’ll do anything to stay there. I honestly feel bad for Carson because he seemed like a pretty nice guy who didn’t deserve this, and hey, maybe it’ll lead him here, you never know.

And I’ve seen so many people saying “She’s such a bad person”. No shit. The same thing happens thousands of guys everyday, the difference is you only notice it when it’s on a big public stage. And all the blue pilled people are going to say “Oh your just over analyzing this” when in actuality I just see this for what it is: a female using men however she can to keep her place among the “influencer” culture.

I know some of us here hate women. It's ok, it's your choice. MGTOW is not about hating women. It's about putting you first, so women have no incidence over your decisions. Like, you're not going to change yourself to get validation from a woman. You're not gonna fall in the traps women set to get you in trouble. It's you first, you become your number one priority.

I don't hate women. I am disappointed in knowing and learning the true nature of women,I believe AWALT, and I try to move on, caring less and less each day about women.

So I thought why be a lurker when you can contribute then decided to share a story I lived couple months ago. I have been living away from my hometown for better education since 2017 in dorms. I visit my family and friends 2-3 times a year. On my last visit we went to see an old family friend. I knew their daughter(lets call her jennifer) but havent talked a lot. After couple hours, when we were leaving, her mother asked me to stay couple days with them and I accepted. A day later I realized Jennifer started acting kinda wierd, I saw where this was going. That night she was really flirty and playful, she was touching me all over and lying with me on the bed. This wasnt the first time a girl was doing this to me, I think it was 4th. Every time I simple stood up and just made up a lie, got out of the place without making it weird. I did the same thing. Next day I was home and she was still a friend of mine. Chose to not lose my virginity again. Whenever I told this story to my friends all of them called me dumb, told me to take the chance I get(which is not something you get a lot in this country). I didnt really agree with them. I think of it like a trade, it is not something girl is giving you and you are taking it. Both genders are participating and even though she found me good enough I didnt feel the same way with her. A month later when I was talking to a friend(female) of mine, she told me that she fought with Jennifer. And another month later when I was talking with my friend again she told me that Jennifer had 8 boyfriends at the same time. “ Those 8 guys didnt really believe it to be true, they all said she wouldnt do it. Then they decided to meet and talk about it. They meet up and checked each others messages. She has been sending them the same nudes and the same messages at the same time. Can you believe that?” she said.

""Everyone knows marriage is better for men- they live longer and are happier than women in marriage""

Truth: men live longer in marriage because they take less risks and have a family to serve and stay alive for. Men absolutely do not need the companionship of a woman to be happy. Men have evolved to be okay with spending years and even decades away from women because for  most men, sex was few and far between.  The only monks who have spent decades in isolation successfully are always men. Women are collectivist animals and cant be alone for too long without going completely insane. Theres no record of women ever successfully setting up a life totally removed from men and thriving. Women post this line all the time because they are absolutely terrified of men collectively realizing they dont need women to be happy.",2020-04-04 14:12:43
