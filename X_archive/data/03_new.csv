I wont argue that modern day feminism isn’t still too female-oriented, it definitely is, and that perpetuates a lot of their problems.

Anyway; wouldn’t it be more effective to advocate for feminism (equality of the sexes) rather than diverging half of what feminism includes and excluding the rest?

For example, father's rights groups are fighting for equal custody laws and divorce reform.  Two issues that effect men not just on a societal level, but also on an institutional, statutory level.

But instead of helping, feminists have been actively fighting against reform in this area.

Feminists should be ALLIES to the men's rights movement but instead they've shown themselves to be a bunch of hypocrites and traitors.

The crazy thing is that reform in these areas would help two issues that feminists claim to care about: the earnings gap and the child care gap.

Fixing these laws would encourage women to work more and rely less on ""trapping men"" for money, since that strategy wouldn't work as well. Which would then help fix both of those issues.

**Giving men equal rights would therefore also help women**. It would be a win-win for everyone, but feminists don't seem to get that.

I’m coming from the side of being an anti-feminist MRA, and I consider myself well researched, well cited, and rational in my arguments. But I’ve been heavily downvoted.

It was rather shocking to me that the people of people seem to genuinely hold the belief that feminism is a completely equitable and fair movement. While the men’s rights movement is the movement in the moral and intellectual wrong. It was eye opening- I really do live in a bubble and am out of touch with what people think- I thought my views were common knowledge and commonly held.

However, I’m stand by that I’m right.

What I realize is that the knowledge I have isn’t common knowledge and is unknown to most people. To me, the sentence “feminists support discriminatory and sexist laws” is obviously true, because over the years I’ve read many examples and can cite many examples. But the people I debate *dont*, so to them, it sounds like I’m against equality for women (I am not)

This is why I now think the men’s rights movement needs to focus on educating people about what the laws actually are, and explain how feminist organizations are relevant to the issues at hand. In this post, I’m just going to give a few examples. There are many more than just these few, but I don’t want the post to be too long. I’m going to demonstrate examples of feminist organizations support inequality under law that hurts men and boys. I don’t have a laptop STM so this is all on my phone, so it won’t be as well written as I’d like. Sorry about that. 

————-

**violencia de genero laws, Spain**

I’ll start with domestic violence laws because they bother me the most, having been personally affected. Feminists support domestic violence laws that have a “gendered” lens, meaning men and women are treated and considered differently by default.

The most extreme example is in Spain, with what’s called the [violencia de genero laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Courts_for_Violence_against_Women). As you’ll see, Spain has a separate justice system to handle domestic violence cases involving women (male victims do not have access to these courts and are treated separately). Under these laws, men can be arrested and jailed without any evidence. Within 72 hours, they appear for trial in one of the special courts. They are not permitted to defend themselves or give any testimony or evidence; they are simply spectators on trial. 

No physical evidence is needed for conviction. A conviction will be handed down as long as the woman’s testimony remains consistent. The sentence is a mandatory 2-5 years in prison. 

So, a man can be sentenced to prison with zero evidence against him, and zero recourse or ability to appeal. Domestic violence against women is the only crime that is handled this way- even murderers as given more opportunities for defense and appeal.

Domestic violence against men is very weakly prosecuted. Usually, a woman will released without charge. She will occasionally be fined. Prison is very rare.  A man who slaps his wife after she hits him will face a harsher punishment than a woman who stabs her husband and sends him to hospital.

As you’ll see in the article, feminists were and still are the main proponents of this law. Many judges protested, calling the law unconstitutional. 

In addition, women receive free housing, monthly compensation and a government job after the accusation. There are [over 100,000 reports a year, and 25,000](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2017/05/31/inenglish/1496243416_419062.html) receive ‘special protection’, the benefits recorder about. (Note, you’ll see male victims included here. This is because they are still covered by law, just to a very different extent)

So this is an example of feminists directly supporting inequality under law.

The US and U.K. have less extreme versions of this, although it varies by jurisdiction. Feminist in the US developed the [duluth model](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth_model), the most widely used procedure model for the US. The Duluth model teaches that can’t be victims of domestic violence, because women are only violent in self defense. I linked to the [criticism page here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth_model#Criticism).

**Employment Equity law, Canada**

The employment equity law is a federal law that has been active since 1995:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_equity_(Canada)

It mandates preference in hiring for 4 groups:

1. Women

2. Minorities

3. Disabled 

4. Native

This means that if a man and woman both apply for a federal job, the woman *must* be hired over a man. The act was revamped in 2019, and it’s now having very severe effects on [male unemployment rates](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/men-male-youth-unemployment-jobs-alberta-1.5389303)- as you’ll see in Alberta, [young male unemployment doubled](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-unemployment-male-youth-feels-dire-1.5390778) in the last year, while women’s stayed the same. This is because it’s impossible for men to get hired when a woman applies for the same job.

Keep in mind, the overall unemployment rate for men in Canada is higher than women’s in all age groups, and by a [significant margin](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-222-x/2008001/sectionb/b-unemployment-chomage-eng.htm)- note for overall youth, female unemployment is at 7.5%, while for young men its 16.8%, more than double. And this doesn’t count those who have stopped looking, which many young men have.

You also get nonsense like this:

[women only jobs for military](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/the-canadian-forces-jobs-where-only-women-need-apply)

[joe bate case](https://torontosun.com/2015/10/28/white-worker-sues-canada-revenue-agency-for-discrimination/wcm/71ed4d61-0d28-46fd-8fe6-61f365241d1a)

Feminists were and are the strongest proponents. This is direct legalized discrimination and difference under law- a man literally has less rights in the Canadian workforce.

———

Imagine if I could fill 1000 more squares like that, because I can. And not just of examples of legal inequality, things like the education grading gap- this study from MIT school of Economics (decent source, I’d say) found boys earn [lower grades for the same work](https://mitili.mit.edu/sites/default/files/project-documents/SEII-Discussion-Paper-2016.07-Terrier.pdf), and [other studies back that up](https://www.bbc.com/news/education-31751672)

I could bring up how currently, it’s not illegal to rape men in India. They are literally excluded from the law. Why? [feminist groups directly protested](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms)

Or feminists in the U.K. [protesting equal pension ages](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-women-pensions/british-women-protest-as-their-pension-age-rises-to-meet-mens-idUSKCN1NB2AM) (men must work until older. This is what MRAs call the [retirement gap](https://menarehuman.com/retirement-age/), where because men have to work until older and die younger, they often only get half the years in retirement. (The argument they give about having “time to prepare” is laughably absurd)

So yes, it annoys me when people say “feminism is for equality”, and when people tell me “the men’s rights movement has no valid cause to exist”. This is, quite simply, utter bullshit.",2020-04-05 17:08:59

I feel this is not only extremely unfair, but unwise. After a week with no food, what will men do? They will be desperate and start stealing. And who has the money to steal from? Women do.

The arguments that women need it “more” really don’t apply when you talking about starvation. Everybody needs to eat.
There’s just no good reason to *not* give men the money too. A man who lives with women might have food, but single men will be completely without food for 3 straight weeks

Even if a man lives with women who gets the money, if only half the population can buy enough food for 1 person, then there won’t be enough food for everybody.

Basically the ""masterpiece"" premise directed by one of the band members is. Girl is stranded in desert, hitchhikes walking down deserted road. Guy pulls up, offers ride. He winks at her, puts hand on her leg briefly. She smiles. Then, he goes into store, she steals car. Wahoo! She was traumatized by his winking and hand on her thigh. So lets steal his car... Then goes to pick up 3 of her other female friends. Then ends up at a motel. Older motel clerk man helps fix the car, while the hood is up, they sneak into the motel lobby and steal food,  beer etc.  

Then go to the diner, eat tons of food, and dine and dash. Just hipster chicks having warm and fuzzy times. The premise bothered me. But more so the MASTERPIECE their 'fans' were calling it on the youtube comments, and instagram. ""Stealing from men vibes""... 

The perception that the first guy deserved his car stolen because he winked and touched her thigh. Feels off. Should he have done that, Probably not. But the way it was written and her clearly not bothered reaction made it not payoff.  The instagram fans saying how they can relate, and pretty much men deserve it. But the innocent older hotel man, who was helping them, for them to steal from him... 

If roles were reversed.. Toxic Masculinity, etc etc. But when women do it. Aww summer vibes, I wanna do this with me and my girlfriends... 

It's a silly music video. Im not on the floor crying. lol But still... Am I wrong?

It kind of reminds me of when I was young in 6th grade. We were on a field trip and my class was heading into an elevator. One of the teachers said in an announcement, “ladies first.” I said it was stupid and didn’t make any sense if women are “equal”.

This is it:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_equity_(Canada)

So a few months ago we saw all those articles about how Alberta has a sudden surge in young male unemployment, at 20%. It’s double for young men than young women, and as the young male unemployment rate suddenly increased, the young female unemployment rate stayed the same:

I believe legal discrimination under the [Employment Equity Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_equity_(Canada)) is a major factor. Under the act, any federal employer is required by law to discriminate against male applicants in favor of female applicants. This essential means that for entry level jobs, a woman will always be hired over a man.

Took a look at a snapshot of Albertas employment situation, [with official statistics here](https://work.alberta.ca/documents/labour-profile-youth.pdf). Scrolling down you’ll see how men are significantly more likely to to be unemployed, but this one star really jumped out at me- [women are 63% of employed youth with college degrees](https://imgur.com/a/oNd4ndD). That’s nearly a 2:1 ratio, and the sort of jobs that would be hired on a federal level. 

Considering that women are automatically preferred over men for federal hiring, might this explain the significantly higher male unemployment rate in Alberta?",2020-04-04 23:48:47

This is my second attempt at my support for ""ungendering"" the legal definition of rape. Some countries (like India) explicitly say that rape is perpetrated by men on women. Some other countries define sex as 'penetration by a penis'. Either way, in no country do I find a legal provision for a female raping a male. Reality, however, is different. Women can rape men just as well- either forcing a man to have sex, or having sex when drunk. I'll try a biological rationale here. And I'm limiting it to heterosexual PIV sex.

***

The act of sex for a man is penetration of the penis into the vagina under consent. The act of sex for a woman is encapsulation of the penis by the vagina under consent. If you remove the element of consent, sex becomes rape, right? So, by definition, women can rape men too.

***

The definition of rape as 'penetration by a penis' is stupider. Assume that the definition of urination is now changed from the Wikipedian one (biological) here

>Urination is the release of urine from the urinary bladder through the urethra to the outside of the body

to a one-sided (legal) one here.

>Urination is the release of urine from the urinary bladder through the penis to the outside of the body

This is now gendered to reflect that only men can urinate. So, women can't pee. Ignore the process of defecation for the moment. Now, schools, universities, offices, airports, railway stations and everywhere need only have men's toilets. No need for women's toilets because legally they can't pee. Urinary infections and related medication can only be focused on men, because women can't pee. Toilets can be designed only for male needs. See how the legal definition trickles down to other institutions...

If a woman can't legally urinate, all the rights and responsibilities associated with urination also vanish. If this sounds ridiculous, then so does the gendered definition of rape.

***

If this were a women's right, the feminist lobby would've gotten the law gender-neutral generations ago. But because it is a crime, feminists are either silent to this gendered definition or actively against those who want to ungender it. Ask a feminist if she is ok with the state preventing a woman to exercise her legal ""right to rape""...",2020-04-04 20:19:28

There is only one way to be safe in this joke of a legal system if you are planning to move to another EU country and that is to take out a divorce in your home country before moving so you know what to expect. Otherwise the incentive which is called alimony to take you to court for your wife will certainly be large and judges and lawyers will happily part with your money. Alimony after all keeps the judiciary busy making money and EU and the Commission have seen to it that nothing will be left of your money.

I was certainly not aware that a divorce could be taken out but in my own country. I posted this here as well so you are aware before it is too late

I have heard from many other outside people not just on reddit that MRA is one of the ""dumbest things to exist"". I don't agree with that opinion but I have been looking through many of the posts checking the comments and many of men calling women bitches or calling all women inherently selfish. Before anyone says that ""oH FeMiNiStS sAy WoRsE"" true feminists will say ""yo bro that's fucked that ain't feminism"" 

Final Note: I am all for male rights, having men and females having equal opportunity to succeed. But seeing all women lumped together makes me feel like many of ya'll are no better then the women who say all men are rapists.

I understand that men have problems, just like women do, and that many of these problems are swept under the rug.
I have a few questions, though, if anyone is willing to answer.
Do you think that men are oppressed, whether systematically or otherwise?
Who do you think “has it worse”: men, women, or do you think we both have it rough equally?
What are a few examples of statistics in your favor?

Again, not saying any of you are wrong. Just curious, as this idea hasn’t ever been introduced to me.

Women are slow, indecisive and passive in accepting a man as worthy of a serious relationship and commitment. If men were to just wait while women take their sweet time to decide, they'd die single by running out of time. Men don't have the luxury of someone else pursuing them all the time. Women can just get a relationship whenever they want from all the suitors, once they've decided they're too old to keep saying no. Women don't have to deal with the very real scenario of never finding anyone.

Women who use shaming on men who behave this way don't realize the self-serving feminist morals we have to live by.",2020-04-04 07:15:42

95,"Have any of you read Naomi Alderman's novel ""The Power""?",7,0,7,fufe8r,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/fufe8r/have_any_of_you_read_naomi_aldermans_novel_the/,1,1585973054.0,"NOTE: I asked before but doing it again since the previous post didn't get much responses.

Have any of you read her novel? For those who have, what do you think of the premise?

In my personal opinion, this book is a bit 50/50. It's an ""interesting"" premise, but the content is just jarring. I think I should start with the elephant in the room.

Why is the Power just limited to women and few men only? I get that it's supposed to represent the strength differences in men and women, as well as trying to creat a plot device to explain how women overtook the world, but that's a bad comparison. An equivalence would be one where ALL men have the weaker version of the Power.

The second point is regarding the women; where are the ones who are supposed to defend the men from those who want to hurt them? Like there were some examples but I was expecting more women to come and say ""This is BS!"". And I'm saying this because for women grown in patriarchal norms, I don't see why they wouldn't. Hell, in real life, ISIS actually recruited women and they were vicious AF. The novel unintentionally portrays the women as naturally bloodthirsty; if internalised misogyny exists, those women would outright attack back.

I might also add, if women did get electrokinesis and society has to get an overhaul, it would just be women defending men and society still moving forward.

Lastly, maybe it's just me, but premises similar to these ones are outright diabolical, even if they come from good intentions. As an example, there's a lot of jokes and portrayals about assaults on male genitals, but I gag if I even think about making a joke about assaulting female genitals. Maybe it's due to shitty media being shitty and poisoning the well, maybe it's just me. Regardless, my point is just how violence against men in fiction is normalized. Don't attack the author because she definitely doesn't believe this. Rather, blane the media.

SPOILERS:

Essentially, it's about women getting the power of electrokinesis, the attainment of which led to events resulting in an overhaul in society, resulting in the whole world going back to Stone Age and history being repeated, except with men being oppressed this time.",2020-04-04 04:04:14

""Made to penetrate"" isn't specified and it takes a little bit of mental gymnastics to interpret it that way.

Feminists have claimed this joke of a definition a victory for male victims of sexual assault when in reality there was no motivation to help male victims at all, it was a serendipitous effect of their own agenda which was to inflate the overall rape statistics so they could get more funding for their own gender-specific causes. But not just that, if they really did care about male victims it would  specify ""made to penetrate"" as well as include other forms of male rape rather than to define it as penetrative sex only. To an objective observer it looks suspiciously like feminists do not want to include women as possible perpetrators of rape.

If we could change this once again we would not only stop feminists from claiming they've done more for male victims than anyone else but we could expose them for being self-serving and neglectful of male victims because of the correction.  The men's Rights Movement should also rightfully take up being the biggest advocate for male victims. Maybe I'm wrong on this but it seems like feminists are the only ones to really care about the definition. Is it worth it to look into this? 
Is anyone else feeling this? If nothing else, I think even a failed campaign  would be a great symbolic victory and probably get a lot of attention, at least in the in social justice universe.",2020-04-04 02:54:55
