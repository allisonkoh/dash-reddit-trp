7,Feminists should be allies to the men's rights movement but have instead shown themselves to be traitors,49,0,49,fvg45m,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/fvg45m/feminists_should_be_allies_to_the_mens_rights/,19,1586131501.0,"Feminists claim to care about equality but often end up disappearing when issues effecting men come up.

For example, father's rights groups are fighting for equal custody laws and divorce reform.  Two issues that effect men not just on a societal level, but also on an institutional, statutory level.

But instead of helping, feminists have been actively fighting against reform in this area.

Feminists should be ALLIES to the men's rights movement but instead they've shown themselves to be a bunch of hypocrites and traitors.

The crazy thing is that reform in these areas would help two issues that feminists claim to care about: the earnings gap and the child care gap.

Fixing these laws would encourage women to work more and rely less on ""trapping men"" for money, since that strategy wouldn't work as well. Which would then help fix both of those issues.

**Giving men equal rights would therefore also help women**. It would be a win-win for everyone, but feminists don't seem to get that.

I’m coming from the side of being an anti-feminist MRA, and I consider myself well researched, well cited, and rational in my arguments. But I’ve been heavily downvoted.

It was rather shocking to me that the people of people seem to genuinely hold the belief that feminism is a completely equitable and fair movement. While the men’s rights movement is the movement in the moral and intellectual wrong. It was eye opening- I really do live in a bubble and am out of touch with what people think- I thought my views were common knowledge and commonly held.

However, I’m stand by that I’m right.

What I realize is that the knowledge I have isn’t common knowledge and is unknown to most people. To me, the sentence “feminists support discriminatory and sexist laws” is obviously true, because over the years I’ve read many examples and can cite many examples. But the people I debate *dont*, so to them, it sounds like I’m against equality for women (I am not)

This is why I now think the men’s rights movement needs to focus on educating people about what the laws actually are, and explain how feminist organizations are relevant to the issues at hand. In this post, I’m just going to give a few examples. There are many more than just these few, but I don’t want the post to be too long. I’m going to demonstrate examples of feminist organizations support inequality under law that hurts men and boys. I don’t have a laptop STM so this is all on my phone, so it won’t be as well written as I’d like. Sorry about that.

**violencia de genero laws, Spain**

I’ll start with domestic violence laws because they bother me the most, having been personally affected. Feminists support domestic violence laws that have a “gendered” lens, meaning men and women are treated and considered differently by default.

The most extreme example is in Spain, with what’s called the [violencia de genero laws](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Courts_for_Violence_against_Women). As you’ll see, Spain has a separate justice system to handle domestic violence cases involving women (male victims do not have access to these courts and are treated separately). Under these laws, men can be arrested and jailed without any evidence. Within 72 hours, they appear for trial in one of the special courts. They are not permitted to defend themselves or give any testimony or evidence; they are simply spectators on trial. 

No physical evidence is needed for conviction. A conviction will be handed down as long as the woman’s testimony remains consistent. The sentence is a mandatory 2-5 years in prison. 

So, a man can be sentenced to prison with zero evidence against him, and zero recourse or ability to appeal. Domestic violence against women is the only crime that is handled this way- even murderers as given more opportunities for defense and appeal.

Domestic violence against men is very weakly prosecuted. Usually, a woman will released without charge. She will occasionally be fined. Prison is very rare.  A man who slaps his wife after she hits him will face a harsher punishment than a woman who stabs her husband and sends him to hospital.

As you’ll see in the article, feminists were and still are the main proponents of this law. Many judges protested, calling the law unconstitutional. 

In addition, women receive free housing, monthly compensation and a government job after the accusation. There are [over 100,000 reports a year, and 25,000](https://english.elpais.com/elpais/2017/05/31/inenglish/1496243416_419062.html) receive ‘special protection’, the benefits recorder about. (Note, you’ll see male victims included here. This is because they are still covered by law, just to a very different extent)

So this is an example of feminists directly supporting inequality under law.

The US and U.K. have less extreme versions of this, although it varies by jurisdiction. Feminist in the US developed the [duluth model](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth_model), the most widely used procedure model for the US. The Duluth model teaches that can’t be victims of domestic violence, because women are only violent in self defense. I linked to the [criticism page here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duluth_model#Criticism).

**Employment Equity law, Canada**

The employment equity law is a federal law that has been active since 1995:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employment_equity_(Canada)

It mandates preference in hiring for 4 groups:

1. Women

2. Minorities

3. Disabled 

4. Native

This means that if a man and woman both apply for a federal job, the woman *must* be hired over a man. The act was revamped in 2019, and it’s now having very severe effects on [male unemployment rates](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/men-male-youth-unemployment-jobs-alberta-1.5389303)- as you’ll see in Alberta, [young male unemployment doubled](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-unemployment-male-youth-feels-dire-1.5390778) in the last year, while women’s stayed the same. This is because it’s impossible for men to get hired when a woman applies for the same job.

Keep in mind, the overall unemployment rate for men in Canada is higher than women’s in all age groups, and by a [significant margin](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/71-222-x/2008001/sectionb/b-unemployment-chomage-eng.htm)- note for overall youth, female unemployment is at 7.5%, while for young men its 16.8%, more than double. And this doesn’t count those who have stopped looking, which many young men have.

You also get nonsense like this:

[women only jobs for military](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/the-canadian-forces-jobs-where-only-women-need-apply)

[joe bate case](https://torontosun.com/2015/10/28/white-worker-sues-canada-revenue-agency-for-discrimination/wcm/71ed4d61-0d28-46fd-8fe6-61f365241d1a)

Feminists were and are the strongest proponents. This is direct legalized discrimination and difference under law- a man literally has less rights in the Canadian workforce.

Imagine if I could fill 1000 more squares like that, because I can. And not just of examples of legal inequality, things like the education grading gap- this study from MIT school of Economics (decent source, I’d say) found boys earn [lower grades for the same work](https://mitili.mit.edu/sites/default/files/project-documents/SEII-Discussion-Paper-2016.07-Terrier.pdf), and [other studies back that up](https://www.bbc.com/news/education-31751672)

I could bring up how currently, it’s not illegal to rape men in India. They are literally excluded from the law. Why? [feminist groups directly protested](https://m.timesofindia.com/india/Activists-join-chorus-against-gender-neutral-rape-laws/articleshow/18840879.cms)

Or feminists in the U.K. [protesting equal pension ages](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-women-pensions/british-women-protest-as-their-pension-age-rises-to-meet-mens-idUSKCN1NB2AM) (men must work until older. This is what MRAs call the [retirement gap](https://menarehuman.com/retirement-age/), where because men have to work until older and die younger, they often only get half the years in retirement. (The argument they give about having “time to prepare” is laughably absurd)

I think this is a bad idea

India has started a new program where [women get 500 rupees in relief cash](https://news.abplive.com/news/india/coronavirus-india-women-to-get-rs-500-per-month-under-pm-jan-dhan-yojana-1188860). This is help survive a total 21 day lockdown- most work is suspended, so most people will be unable to earn money. 

Men however, get nothing. This will, IMO, lead to riots and starvation as hunger builds in desperate men. I did a [video on it](https://youtu.be/CAZQBgK_Qmk) too.

I feel this is not only extremely unfair, but unwise. After a week with no food, what will men do? They will be desperate and start stealing. And who has the money to steal from? Women do.

The arguments that women need it “more” really don’t apply when you talking about starvation. Everybody needs to eat.
There’s just no good reason to *not* give men the money too. A man who lives with women might have food, but single men will be completely without food for 3 straight weeks

Even if a man lives with women who gets the money, if only half the population can buy enough food for 1 person, then there won’t be enough food for everybody.
