Tonight's discussion takes on The Wall and how it applies to women's pluralistic mating strategy. This episode was shaped towards women, but the research articles below are worth reading and the video is evergreen for the entire Red Pill community.

Not only do they discuss The Wall and how women can navigate it, but for those with kids they give useful tips and pitfalls to consider with raising your daughters as they enter the Sexual Marketplace. 

Key questions that were raised...

* Were our elders on to something by restricting daughters' sexuality when they come of age by screening boys they can intersect with? 
* What role do parents and grandparents play in this process?
* What pitfalls does social media create? 
* How can women navigate the sexual marketplace while avoiding getting alpha widowed or being paralyzed by choice due to the advent of dating apps like Tinder?

**The Wall:** The hallmarks of fertility are largely responsible for what make makes women physically attractive to men. To wit, looks and fertility are effectively one in the same. The further women move away from their peak fertility years (late teens to early 20s) the less physically attractive women become. Mother Nature is not a feminist. 

**Strategic Pluralism:** Women's mating strategy has often been referred to as a dualistic strategy (AF vs BB), but it's more nuanced than that. As discussed in the livestream, there's the AF/BB during women's monthly cycle and then there's a macro level application of this across their lives opting for AF during their youth and then settling for BB once they approach the dreaded wall. Ideally women should strive for guys that have a good blend of both dad *and* cad qualities. The best of both worlds if you will. Guys that get this figured out have options galore as they're the total package, so our advice to the ladies is to not delay if you know early on you want to have a family someday.

801,fucqlt,"This is a repost, but it would appear we have some new posters that need some guidance.  I am giving an amnesty to any post that has been posted to date, unless it is an egregious rules violation or a site wide violation.  I cannot promise automod or another mod might yank it.

Also be sure to [visit this note](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/f9cm7n/reddit_admin_are_hellbent_on_killing_off_reddit/) from our chief mod and operator of http://trp.red/
----------------------------

A few weeks ago I posted about the quality of submissions and the sort of things I would summarily remove without comment.  It would appear the message was not received.  So I’m going to try again but with additional detail and perhaps a bit more menacing.  

Before continuing, you should read [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ery372/dear_diary/) if you haven’t already.

##Priorities

**A guiding principle of this sub has always been QUALITY over quantity.**

We don’t need to shit-spew dozens and dozens of posts a day like so many other shitholes on reddit.  You can participate by providing good content.  In return the rest of us give the same to you.  Since there are more of us that you, you should be spending more time listening than talking.

**ECs and founding members are important to us.**

We want them to stick around or at least stop by from time to time.  We value what they have to say.  We value their critiques.  We value their experience.  We do not value your personal life story.  We do not value your justice porn.  We do not value your need TO [SAY SOMETHING](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3d5u6t/first_post_syndrome/).

You should be listen to the ECs and refrain from doing things that would drive them away.  Disagreement is ok, but do so in a mature, professional manner.  Refine your ideas before presenting them.  Simply negating an EC looks like dick waving, not proper discourse.  

##The rules and guidelines

**The rules are not optional.**. READ THEM: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/about/rules/  

These supplement site wide rules.  READ THOSE TOO: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy

NO VIOLENCE.  Period.  Zero tolerance.  This is a site wide rule that I completely agree with.  Don’t even joke about it.

This rule and “Threatens, harasses, or bullies” are the hammers that the reddit admins use to nuke subs.  The difficulty for them has been that we have always banned this sort of behavior.  There will be no brigading.  We do not spill out into any other subs unless explicitly invited.  We keep what we do in our subs and leave everyone else the hell alone about it.  

I have and will work with mods in other subs to root out people that violate this so we can ban them.

**Do not name anyone that is not a public figure.  Do not post pictures of anyone that is not a public figure.**  We don’t care what your girlfriend looks like.  We don’t care about some random bar slag you want us to point and laugh at.  

**Breaking any rule is a bannable offense.**  Not knowing a rule is also a bannable offense.  Deleting your bannable post or comment and then asking us why you were banned is going to get you permanently banned.
  
##Post quality

Obviously this does not strictly apply to comments, but we ask you to at least TRY to say something of value.  One word responses and short zingers just clutter shit up.  Do the latter only if you think it really adds to the point.

**There are post formatting rules.**

Yes, really.  Read them here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3a0135/announcement_new_thread_requirements/. I’m going to start enforcing them again, but not super strictly.  Sometimes a different format works better.  Ask yourself: is your writing so good that your format makes it better?  In most cases, the answer will be NO and I will remove it.

We do allow direct links into manosphere.  We allow links elsewhere IF ACCOMPANIED BY A COMMENT THAT PROVIDES ANALYSIS OF THE LINK.  Don’t be lazy.  A 50 word TL;RD is not analysis.  Tell us what you think about it and what it teaches, not just what it says.

**There are content guidelines and principles.**

Read them here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3d4qb2/on_platitudes_imperatives_and_unsolicited_advice/. https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1u6m3m/the_basics_explained_and_our_direction_for_2014/. https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2xwllf/100000/

If you haven’t read all of this, don’t post.  You aren’t ready.

##Post removal 

I’ll try to be more explicit than last time.  This is the last time I give you lists.  From here on out it is your burden to figure out what is post worthy and what is not.  So here is the list of things that will get removed without comment:

- Pointing and laughing without a learnable point.  Making fun of other people is a waste of time.  Learning how to avoid their predicament is useful.
- Justice porn.  This isn’t a contest and there are no winners and losers.
- Seeking validation.  We are not your mommy.  If you need our opinion to feel better about yourself, you are not ready to post.  Validation seeking is a destructive and gross behavior.  Chicks most certainly hate it.  I hate it too.
- Black pill woe is me shit.  Your life sucks?  Keep it to yourself.
- Black pill woe is you shit.  My life sucks?  That’s my problem.
- Links to other subs that haven’t been scrubbed through an archive service.  A couple popular services are https://www.trp.red/archive.php and http://archive.is.
- Dear diary posts.  Basically you talking about yourself without giving a concrete, learnable point.   “He guyzzz, it really works!” is not a learnable point.
- Autistic ramblings about your life.
- [This sort of shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/cc0vj2/about_cosmomasculinity/).  Does it sound like clickbait?  Is it formatted like clickbait?  Don’t do it.
- Debating or negating.  We don’t give a fuck if you disagree.  If you think you have a better way, then present it as a better way.
- Stuff that belongs on https://www.reddit.com/r/ThankTRP/

The following are danger areas.  There are lots of good posts that do it, but be mindful of the content guidelines and principles.  They are:

- Prescriptive advice.  Tell me a proper way to eat, drink, lift and general life skills can be useful, even if controversial.   Giving us a checklist of how to approach is not.  The former are material acts with specific results.  The latter is how something worked for you, which is worthless to the rest of us.  You’d be better off telling us Why it worked for you.
- Politics.  Der.
- Meta topics.  If you really think there is a hot topic, then ask us first. 
- MGTOW but because of what I will be saying about incels below.
- Short posts unless it’s a razor sharp and novel point.  Good posts usually take time. 

##Ban bait

Aside from violating the rules, the following might get you banned (technically they are rules violations, so consider these examples, rather than additions).  They are:

- Incel content.  I’m so fucking done with it.  No memes.  No egging each other on.  No trying to find your kin.  Zip.  If I sniff an incel, you are gone.  You better be an incel in active recovery.
- [Jordan Peterson](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9gyopm/no_more_jordan_peterson_shit/)
- [This sort of trash](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/emxugb/last_night_i_didnt_have_sex/).  Read the comments, chucklekfucks, if you want to find out what the post really means.  This one is temporarily suspended until Max does his follow up post.

**I’m serious about incel content—-it’s gone.**. The worst fucking thing reddit ever did was shut down braincels, because now the rest of us will suffer it.  We are now joining a large number of other subs that are shutting it down.  

As a clarification, I understand there is a difference between “black pill” and incel.  You can harbor dark opinions while not actually being an incel.  Your opinions will be judged on everything else in this post and not by a possible connection to incel content.  Connect the dots is a game simpleton’s play (aka a whole lot of other subs).

##Closing remarks

**There are no new rules in this post.**  This all flies under what was already acceptable or not acceptable.  

A lot of focus is being put into our other home:  http://trp.red.  If you are looking for more diverse topics, go there.  Find or found a tribe for it.  Here we are going to refine focus on our core principles and purpose, and expect quality in posts.

Feel free to ask questions in comments.  I’ll do what I can as long as I don’t get overwhelmed.

Finally, I hereby grant a general amnesty for any post submitted before this one—as long as it doesn’t break site wide rules.  I also may leave some posts up but locked with a note why it should have been removed.  These are teaching moments; make use of them.",801,2.0,0.6685000061988831,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck"
802,fuxcf4,"**INTRO**

I discovered TRP five or six years ago now. At that point in my life, I was smart, egotistic, socially awkward, and not particularly (read: not at all) attractive. I'm sure we all have our own treasured memories from high school.  

Over the years I succeeded and failed in applying TRP. A few years back, I met the girl who would become my first LTR ever. TRP ideas helped me predict her behavior, but I also used them to mask my insecurities. Instead of writing a novella with all the boring details, I jump from idea to idea doing my best to avoid TRP cliches.

**BODY**

First things first, my self awareness when she and I met might have put me on the autism spectrum (she used to point out similarities between myself and her friend with aspergers). My looks compensated for it; **weight lifting** contributed to my looks more than any other factor. I cannot overstate how important weight lifting has been in my life the past half a decade or so.

Sex was always the most enjoyable when I treated it as a game. I learned to not go into the bedroom with a script in my head of how things were supposed to go; instead I went with the flow based on how she and I were feeling. Sometimes we fucked dirty, sometimes we made love, other times we just fucked around giggling like kids. Going with the flow always kept it natural; forcing it always felt rigid and unnatural. The only book I've read on the topic is The Sex God Method. I think it's a good place to start developing your own brand of sexuality. 

An LTR will change you. You'll likely become gentler, softer, and more pleasure seeking. Being on the other side now, I can see how my LTR changed me in those ways. It's inevitable, and it's something you should be aware of before shacking up. This change has pros and cons: I lost some of my aggression and ambition, but gained empathy and a certain *joie de vivre*. Now that my relationship is over, I've regained my natural aggression and retained the soft skills I developed with my girl. 

**CONCLUSION**

I'm grateful to have known the amazing girl I dated and for being TRP conscious going in. Before my relationship, I was decently attractive but very rough around the edges. IMO, LTRs are great for refining all aspects of seduction (wit, foreplay, etc.) and social agility. More than anything, I treasure the intimacy I shared with her and the connection we made. All in all, I'm very satisfied with how things turned out and what I learned from the experience.

**Edit**

I left out a lot of details to avoid beating dead horses. The rougher I treated her in bed, the better she treat me. When I fucked her weak she acted out. If I acted like a pussy, she treated me like a pussy. Et cetera, et cetera. You know the rest.",802,2.0,0.49320000410079956,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck"
803,fu8g4g,"There are 3 types of vocal tonality: **Rapport Seeking**, **Rapport Neutral**, and **Rapport Breaking**.

**I want to talk about Rapport Seeking**:

This is the tone you often hear when people ask a stranger a question. “Excuse me, do you have the time?” It’s disarming. You want to make sure the stranger feels comfortable with you approaching them on the street, so you’re basically raising the pitch of your voice to subtly say “Hey stranger, I am of no harm to you, please don’t be afraid as I approach.”

This is a safe and recommended tone for women to use. In fact, if you’re anything like me and were raised by a single mom, then *you probably don’t even realize that you replicate this tone in social situations*. 

**My mother spoke** to us children in her neutral voice, but the moment the phone rang, she would answer **with her rapport seeking tone**. The same would happen when she spoke to a stranger (the waiter, post office clerk, people at the bus stop, my teachers, etc.). Literally every person she encountered, my mother’s tone would raise and without realizing it, **I grew up doing the same thing**.

**This tone is crippling for a man.** You are conveying that you are lower status. People pick up on the cue and act accordingly. If you don’t believe me, the next time you are having a conversation with someone, male or female, take note of their tone as the conversation progresses. If you are speaking to them in a rapport seeking tone, they will change their tone in response. Your tone is saying, “I am lower status than you, please be kind to me, I am harmless.” They will change their tone to a more rapport breaking (Higher status) tone. This won’t even be a conscious shift. It just happens because people naturally pick up on social cues and nonverbal communications. 

Learning this was unbelievably eye-opening for me. I saw a YouTube video a few years ago about vocal tones (I'm aware the red pill covers this, but that isn't where I originally learned about tonality) and then I began noticing mine when I spoke. Awareness is the first step to change. Then it's time to take responsibility. **I could’ve blamed my mother, but instead,** **I** **grabbed the wheel** and took responsibility for making the change. It was awkward at first because I had to literally correct myself mid-sentence, “Hi!” (Rapport seeking tone) \*ahem\* “Hey, how are you?” (Rapport Neutral)

The first female I tried this on was a cashier I saw multiple times a week. Usually, she didn’t even look up at me during our transaction. However, just simply changing my tone of voice to a Rapport Neutral (and eventually I mixed in some Rapport Breaking), she not only made eye contact with me the entire time, but her voice tone went from Rapport Breaking to Rapport Seeking towards me. Soon, she would greet me as I stood in line, and our small-talk was much more comfortable.

I began applying it to every conversation I had, no matter who I spoke to. Males that I used to feel were kind of dicks towards me either accepted me as their equal, or even flipped the script and began speaking to me in a rapport seeking tone. Even my female boss now speaks to me in a rapport seeking tone (That one was a surprising shift at first).

Check your tone of voice. If you’re seeking rapport from others, bring that pitch down to a neutral place (the tone you speak in when talking to your friends) and even learn when to mix in some rapport breaking tones to raise your status. You will be surprised at how much it changes your life.",803,0.0,0.3066999912261963,"girl, feel, really, find, still, shit, male, always, leave, relationship"
804,fuywge,"I know it's a basic and simple question, but it has been on my mind for quite a while.

This thought began just an hour ago when a friend left a comment on a certain Instagram post of mine. He's a good buddy, the man who first introduced me to the ways of TRP. His comment lacked gracefulness, and I wished not to interact in conversation with rudeness and unmannerly remarks. I left no reply.

The problem of modern men is not only about the self-defeating competition against himself in fucking women. The problem is also about how they talk without using their brain. Some people express rudeness without even the slightest consideration. Maybe it's a cultural thing, maybe not. Who cares, any socially intelligent man expresses his opinions with poise. In layman's terms, he is not viewed as trash by society.

I'm in my mid-20s and I'm starting to find my own lane, knowing who I really am. Gone was the guy who displays rakish behavior. Gone was the guy who objectifies women. There's a certain place for a man to act that way and that's when he is a boy. I want to be elegant and would act the part growing up.

TRP is a body of knowledge. Since it has originated from the persepective of insecurity and a lack of self-confidence, the ones that 'awaken' learn the truth behind why things are the way they are, but they fail to identify a deeper side of self-development and it is true acceptance of what is, while applying the truth and not altering himself to what he is not.

As Rollo once said, ""personality is not static."" Best to be yourself while applying what you know of the truth. People, and not just women, could intuitively smell from a mile away whether you are being true to yourself or you are just playing a character based on your imagination from the truth.

Confidence is acceptance of what you really are–your strengths, your weaknesses, you are all of them. Embrace them and play them to your advantage.

Guys introduced to the facets of TRP turn to a more materialistic approach of application, while failing to regard to *age well* with it. Like fine wine, it takes years of intensive care to taste its best flavor. Only then can we say that the juice is well worth the squeeze.

Yesterday, some guy posted on this sub about his frustrations from living the TRP life. Despite his 'years of self-education' with the knowledge and truth, he has found no meaning from fucking around with countless women he encountered throughout his journey. TRP is not a cycle of fucking women over and over, nor is it a game of who gets more lays than who, but rather it is a means of getting to know more about the self and how it can be refined further growing up.

I'm turning 27 this year. Most of my buds still act like they are still in college, being reckless and disregarding the perception of what people think of them. Boys will be boys, so the saying goes. But also, boys turn into men and it starts from a shift in mindset.

Sure, priorities change as men grow up. They get married. Get frustrated by their wives. We all know this premise way too much. Of course, it's a shame if you don't realize that we are the ones who should recognize this narrative more than the other guys. The narrative has been the same ever since Eve ate the apple.

What's more important growing up is the *mindset*. At age 30-35, fucking women wouldn't be the main priority, heck it wouldn't even be an issue, because the mindset has changed. Counting the number of lays has its own place in the life of a TRP-ed man... but growing up elegantly is what drives value even further into the sexual market place--sometimes I cringe even mentioning these terms because they all seem to stem from technicality, that it seems so unnatural for a man in the perspective of a woman.

Sure, ok, not giving a fuck what people think is what other people would argue... but I have considered that I do give a fuck about what people think because everything boils down to how much people would like to associate with me. May it be in business, peers, or even as shallow as the women I attract.

I find that a handful of people in the TRP community values the knowledge behind the ideologies to its utmost potential. However, some guys fail to realize that women are not only sexual objects of desire, as a way to compensate for self-improvement and progress, but people also degrade themselves by doing this. And that is not very elegant.

I think elegance is the highest form of value (in all the market places in the economy of human relations) caused by a clean mindset, intention, and discipline.

I really enjoyed the post about female solipsism, as it's something that can be vividly seen and tracked. So here is a recent story. 

So because of all this quarantine and lockdown, I've been getting texts from some of women that I used to try to spin or the ones I was actively trying to before the virus hit the fan. 

I'm not much of a texter, I suck at reading between the lines, therefore for me, it's a logistics tool. I use it strictly to share important information and set up dates. I don't use social media either. I used to, but it's a waste of time. So when I got the following text, I really didn't know not only what time think, but what to say.

9:40 PM : Please PLEASE do not tell anyone because I do not know how I ended up here I trust you.

I just did cocaine.

What? Okay first of all this chick is wild, this doesn't surprise me. Hot, extroverted, witty. She knows her game. She's hard to get. She normally doesn't share personal information or what she does, besides I don't text things like ""what are you up to"". I've been using the rule of less is more and slowly reeling her in. Her issue? Awful friends/influence/coworkers. Note: Apparently cocaine goes around but she ""would never do such a thing"". 

Here is where this is a great example of solipsism.

She is acting like it happened on its own. It just happened. She is not responsible. Which is utter bullshit. Social perception got her in this position and now it's hitting her that she fucked up and is a bad girl. She always was, she likes her alcohol and pot, and with cocaine being all around her it was bound to happen. But telling women what to do is useless. What they see is what it is, and she saw herself as capable, responsible, good. Wrong. She's nowhere near. 

I soft nexted. Seriously I have 2 dull plates waiting after quarantine, and it sucks cause this woman would not care about quarantine restrictions, but not looking for crazy. Especially when they follow up the texts with:

Idk why I shared with you, I'm sorry, I just need to tell someone, I'm in a bad stage in life, it will never happen again.

Why even apologize? If she never told me I could keep fucking her and not be bothered. But she cares what people prcieve her as. And that's all women care about.

TLDR

Plate texts me she did cocaine and it's not her fault and she isn't responsible. Right. You get the rest. The only reason women will tell you something like this is because they think you're some benevolent God who will forgive them and tell them everything is okay! She's not bad!

Edit:

I'm glad this brought up discussion, as thinking about something is a lot more productive than simply absorbing information.

Edit 2: 

So what I've learned is there are way to many coke heads on Reddit! Y'all need some serious medical attention my friends! COVID-19 does like a weak immune system :D",805,4.0,0.390500009059906,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

Disclaimer: This is not a post about how to get girls, there are so many posts on that here in trp or the PUA community or whatever on what you should and should not do (even though it all comes down to how much you try and the experience you have in the end) this post is on how to maintain your plates, the reasons as to why we break them and what it looks like when you get laid consistently.

The problem with texting

I know that during this pandemic there are guys here who feel the need to text their plates or even new girls. Please for the love of god stop texting girls. Girls, you've hooked up with, girls you want to hook up with, it doesn't matter stop texting them. You can never break a plate by not texting her during this pandemic. But if your attention-seeking, validating, orbiting ass keeps texting her it's easy to fuck up. 

This doesn't just go for this pandemic, it's for everyday life as well.

A bad habit for me personally that I had to get rid of is thinking that if a girl isn't constantly texting me she'll never want to fuck again. This couldn't be further from the truth. The closer you get to her only wanting to text you when she wants to fuck, the better. SHE HAS FRIENDS FOR CONVERSATION, SHE HAS BETA ORBITERS FOR VALIDATION, she should only have you when she wants DICK. All of the women that I fuck consistently, or women that my buddies have, usually only text them Friday night, Saturday night, during the holidays, during their breaks from work or late at night, why? Because that's when they wanna fuck. Not at 1 pm on a Monday afternoon during their bi-monthly hair appointment.  I realize this because I've hooked up with girls and I would forget all about them, not text them at all, and a month later they'd hit me up at 2 am talking about ""wyd rn"". They hit me up, not the guy who they've been texting constantly for the past month, not the guy who commented on her Snapchat story, me, the hot guy who is the opposite of needy and doesn't really give a fuck about them. They're times where I've had to reject girls just because of how fucking late they would hit me up. 

Silence is what you should want, I mean fuck, I like it that way, it's peaceful. Just because you're phone isn't blowing up does not mean no girl wants to fuck with you, just calm down and only text when you wanna set up a plan to meet, or if she wants to text you. Don't try to get your snapchat popping or your phone going off by replies from women just because it feels good, you're fucking up, even if it is flirtatious the main thing is -  it is not necessary, and it makes it easier to fuck up.

Here is why you've already failed when you start texting for convo, the only reasons why you would have to in the first place is because: 

1. You didn't leave a good enough impression when you first met so you're tryna make up for it via text - which almost never works, and is so incredibly hard compared to being in-person that it's not worth pursuing. 
2. You're lonely and want the attention of a woman 
3. You haven't even met the girl - which I strongly advise against sliding into the dm's and being grouped with the hundreds (yes hundreds, doesn't matter if the girl is hot or not) of betas who've already tried.
4. You lack an ""abundance mentality""
5. You just want her to know you exist - (lol you pathetic piece of shit, but damn I've been there too)

What does it look like for guys who get laid consistently

Let me break down what getting laid consistently looks like, it's not a lot of effort, in fact, it's almost no effort when it happens, most of the effort comes at the beginning, once you have it though, it's easy to maintain. For starters, do as I said before and stop texting for convo. It's a Saturday night or whatever and you want to get laid, okay great! You've already texted that girl you met in class three days ago who you gamed to the point where she would be down to hang. Oh, you haven't? You haven't even met a new girl this week? Jesus. No worries, text that plate who you know would be down to hang because you know she likes you a lot. She hasn't responded? Text your other plate. She's going to the club with her friends? Text your other plate, wait, you don't have any other plates? You only have TWO girls on your phone who you've hooked up with recently? What the fuck?

Okay, not all hope is lost, you can go to the club with the other plate, or with your friends who like to go out, and you can either get with her there or find some other girl because damn, you're in desperate need for more women in your life. You may not pull today but maybe tomorrow, as you learn and grow from your mistakes. Maybe next week, it takes time, it takes rejection. But you'll get to the point where you have a solid amount of plates. 

As you get more plates and start texting girls only when you want to hang out, the more of a chance you have for a girl to hit you up when she's free, and the more likely you are to find a girl who would be down to hang out. Don't get lazy and try to be fuck buddies instantly with the girl you just met by texting her a lot, it's not how this works. And even if you become successful with fucking this one girl a lot, what happens when she flakes, or when she isn't free? You're jacking it. Texting doesn't get you anywhere. But it all starts with you going out and trying to pull, and doing it consistently.

""Oh great, so basically in order to get laid consistently you have to be getting laid consistently, great fucking advice man"". Thank you, and it fucking is! You can't be getting laid consistently without looking like a man who gets laid consistently, you've read trp you know how this shit works. What do you need to maintain your perceived attractiveness from a girl? 

1. Outcome Independence 
2. Abundance Mentality 
3. IDGAF attitude

These are all traits of men who get laid a lot, and women think they should fuck. You have to fake this first. Me and you both are not the type of men to get laid a lot, we're not that hot, we don't have that cool of a  job according to society or fame or that much money. But the guys who do, and the guys who girls want, all have these attributes. The good thing is, girls feel this instinctually, so if you can fake out their instincts at first by acting like a guy who does get laid a lot, well, you get the picture. The moment a girl believes you do not have these qualities, your attractiveness diminishes. Again, to get a girl is easy enough, just go on trp and search it up and emulate what they tell you, you'll hear about shit tests, escalation, push-pull yaddi yadda, but what you need in order to keep getting laid by the same girl are those three things. Simply put, texing a specific girl for long periods of time about a subject that doesn't fucking matter diminishes these qualities because it becomes obvious you're texting her because 1, you care what she thinks and what she says, 2, you don't have anything better to do or anyone else to text. Now look at those three attributes, does acting like that align with it? No. 

So you realize you shouldn't be texting and you need more plates so you shoot your shot at several women consistently every other day. And you remembered to follow up on your kills for some other day you can hang out. Now you always have a girl you can hit up. After a while, you get to a point where there's no point in texting all of these women anyways because who has the energy to keep up with text conversations with 10+ women. Once this happens to you guess what, you become less needy, you don't care what happens when you don't text this girl, or if you say this or that to her, you ACTUALLY become outcome independent, you don't have to fake it because you ACTUALLY always have another girl you can fall back to. Women pick up on your abundance mentality and your idgaf attitude which helps maintain your attractiveness. You're experienced now you know how to handle interactions with girls so you ooze confidence, also maintaining your attractiveness. You can fucking RELAX and not text now because, with all these women on your phone who you've met with and hooked up with consistently when Saturday night comes now there's bound to be a message waiting for you, a girl invites you to her house at 12 pm to fuck, or better yet, dinner. And look at that, you didn't even have to ask her how her day was. 

Don't let your thirstiness take over this pandemic, it'll just make things worse, #stoptextingplates2020",806,0.0,0.41909998655319214,"girl, feel, really, find, still, shit, male, always, leave, relationship"
807,fugmsf,"Edit: This post mainly goes out to the ones who frequent askTRP.

I'd advise reading my previous post 'Perception' before reading this.


First and foremost. TRP is full of men who want to cling on to their own perception in order to stroke their own ego. These men are saying to themselves that they're an alpha, why? It gives them a boost to their own ego. It feels good. You may be one of these men reading this and thinking that you don't stroke your own ego, in order to STROKE YOUR OWN EGO. Well, do you want to find out if you do or not? 




Ask yourself these questions:




- Do you repetitively delete your posts/comments on here and askTRP? 



- Do you try to justify your actions to others?



- Can you not accept being wrong?



- Do you insult others?



- Do you post and feel worried about what other members of TRP are going to say?



- Do you live your life by what other people say here by a dime?



- Do you suffer with severe cognitive dissonance about the theory of TRP?



- Do you care so much about being 'alpha'?




If you say yes to any of these. YOU'RE STROKING YOUR OWN EGO. 




Many will cling on to their perception no matter what, why? Because they're afraid of being wrong, and therefore afraid of being emotionally hurt. That's EGO. 



Few will challenge their own perception. To be fair, everyone who actively participates in TRP has challenged their own perception. But there's another hurdle, breaking free from the ""I'm so alpha"" bullshit here, ESPECIALLY in askTRP.



You need to make your own rules. At the moment, you are following rules of others who are stroking their own ego too, just like you. You are the blind being lead by the blind.



Now, it's important to remember that not ALL people in TRP are blind. Notable examples would be the mods and EC's.



Now, it's perfectly OK if you're one of these men who are blind, because it's your current perception. Your perception in the future is going to be different from now, but only if you are able to challenge your own perception, and other people's perceptions. This post is ME challenging your perception. It is vital for a person to be able to do this, as this is how they move on.



Side note: Your perception is another name for your frame.



You can control other people's perception to a certain extent, by perceiving yourself as this and that, which is fine. But you shouldn't care about their perception of you. This is what outcome independence TRULY means.



If you're worried about other people's perception of you. That means you're not being true to yourself. You're not making your own rules. You're living by other people's rules.




On to my next point:



TRP IS JUST A TOOLBOX. STOP WORSHIPPING A FUCKING TOOLBOX.


You decide what you do with the toolbox.


> What you create is up to you.


Credit to The1ndex for that quote.



People here say this for a reason, you know?




Another point:



The EC's on here are not gods, or super-ultra-mega-fucking Chads. Sure, they might have a lot of 'Chad' traits. But they also have 'beta' traits. They are human beings, just like you and me.



Speaking of EC's, I messaged Heathcliff the other day, and he explained to me that being stuck in the manosphere means that you've hit a wall in your development. You need to leave to enter the next stage of learning and understanding. He goes further mentioning the Pareto principle, from my interpretation, 80% of the men here get stuck stroking their own ego, while only 20% actually learn something.



Lessons learned:



- Stop saying that you're 'alpha'. You're seeking validation and feeding your ego.


- Stop making 'red pill' a part of your identity. TRP IS A TOOLBOX.


- Just because someone follows TRP, doesn't mean that they're a worthy source of information or advice. THIS IS WHY EC'S ARE A THING.


- Stop stroking your ego.


- When you get the message, hang up the phone. - credit to Heathcliff


- Make your own rules, and live by them.

- Stop mentally masturbating.

- Be that 20%.




- You HAVE to let go.

808,ftmmfy,"Tag makes it obvious, but: This is a theory I've worked on for some time. It applies mostly to men in or headed for LTR.

Food is a trap.  Don't fall for it.

An LTR partner will almost always try and ""fatten you up."" But that makes me less attractive, you say. Why would she want that?

Simple: It reduces your SMV. 

As someone else said here on a recent ""Best of"" post: Validation is sex for women. Its their primary need, in terms of what they get from men. Sex itself is secondary; its the validation they are after. And having you focused solely on them, and no one else, provides them enormous amounts of validation. What they need beyond that, they will get by wearing low cut shirts to work and leaning over the cubicles of overweight office workers desperate for female attention, to make them drool a while.

Meanwhile, SMV for men is determine by a LARGE margin, by physique. Thats not the ONLY factor, but is a BIG factor. By ""fattening you up"" she is essentially taking you off the sexual market. Making it so that other women, are not even interested. 

This gives her the power. It places your existence, within her frame. Think about if: If you are off the sexual market, Dread Game is impossible. If no one wants your fat ass, she never needs to worry. The power dynamic shifts to favor her to an immense degree. But this also means you can never, ever make her tingle; if there's no risk inherent in the relationship, no dread, her hamster has basically rolled over and gone to sleep...until someone ELSE wakes it up.

Do not let her junk food fixation, become your way of life. She will try. SUbtly, at first. Desert night once per week. Then next thing you know, she's buying potato chips and ice cream on every shopping run. Maybe she knows why she does it; more probably she doesn't even understand her compulsion to fatten up her husband or long time partner. But the fact remains: The result is your removal from the sexual marketplace completely, the utter inability to use dread game, and her complete stranglehold on your sex life and the relationship as a whole.

This leads to staleness and boredom. A complete lack of emotional tingles. And we ALL know where the next step is from there.

809,fsytc4,"Let’s start with a few truths:

1: You have no control over where, when, or to whom you were born.

2: You don’t have the mental capacity to take control of your life as a child.

3: Some things are just NOT YOUR FAULT.

Now,

You can blame your circumstances on your past, on your poverty, on your race, on your gender, etc. You can point the finger in so many directions, and EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, you are relinquishing control of your own life. Why would you want to do that? Do you want society to dictate your short comings? Do you want society to tell you that you are disadvantaged? Do you want pity, or do you want glory?

What can you do?

Well, the first step is to OWN IT! Take full responsibility. That’s right. Take the “blame” for things that aren’t your fault. Why on earth would you do that? Because, it puts you in the driver seat. It gives you the power!

**Owning your life is the first step to changing it.** 

**It isn’t your fault for how you were raised, but it is 100% your responsibility to overcome your circumstances.** 

Living in housing projects wasn’t my choice, but the friends I associated with was. **Even though I was too young to make good life decisions, that only allows me to forgive myself for my choices, not deflect responsibility.** 

I chose to break the law. I chose to skip school. I chose not to pay attention and learn. I chose to smoke. I chose to drink. I chose to have sex. I chose to rebel. I chose to refuse to live by my father’s rules when I moved in with him at 17, and then I chose to live on the street instead of giving in to him. I chose to pursue a rap career, and I chose not to invest back in the business. I chose to party instead. I chose to go out to California with no plan. I chose not to work hard when I got there. I chose to take pills that led to my overdose. I chose to make a change in my life right then and there. Then I chose to call my dad, come home, and join the Navy. I made all of those decisions, but I only took credit for the last few good decisions. The rest, I blamed on my circumstances.

Nothing is going to get better until you accept FULL responsibility for your actions, past and present. You must forgive yourself for the past decisions you’ve made that were during the times you didn’t have control over your life. You must forgive yourself, but you CAN NOT EXCUSE yourself. You just do your best from now on. You get in the driver’s seat, **you grab the wheel**, and you steer yourself to the life that YOU choose. It isn’t easy, and the road may be long and windy, but would you rather sit back seat to someone else’s adventure? Not me. I choose to drive.

This is the be all and end all: __why do you fucking care?__

They’ve just found this awesome forum on the internet that is 100% guaranteed to turn them into pussy slaying LVL 99 alpha bro dudes overnight - great.

Asktrp has all the answers they need. They read the sidebar (or don’t, more often than not), read a couple GLO posts and get motivated to go try this shit in real life. They go do some curls, call a dude a beta, cold approach a girl or 2 and then run into an error. “Why did this girl take 1 minute longer than usual to reply? I’m red pilled now, how is this happening? Asktrp will know!” So they run and ask the internet alphas for advice. They get called a faggot and told to go lift, get some piece of advice, and then they go back about their business. Then they will keep getting spoon fed every time they run to asktrp for help.

811,ft387l,"As everyone here knows the Red Pill is not a reactionary ideology that came about as a direct response to the SJW feminism of 2013. No! It is a state of the art research facility where angst ridden virgins, chubby divorced dads and spectrum spergs trade notes on their scientific findings to delve into the mysteries of getting women to ""open bobs and vagine."" The Red Pill is a community of lab coat wearing scientists who analyse 100% true unbiased field reports in order to unlock the secrets of quantum ""All Women Are Whores.""

As rational empirical alpha male sex scientists the logical way to begin our research is by measuring our penises. This however presents the issue of replicability and the need for a Uniform Penis Measurement Standard (UPMS).  How do we determine where the base of the penis truly begins? Is it where the shaft emerges from the fatty mons tissue? Or do we press the ruler into the pelvis to obtain a  measurement at the dick stem? How do we account for odd shapes and curves? Akin to an HB scale, we need to an objective amalgamate unit scale that takes all factors into consideration. A True Penis (TP) value of 1- 10 which factors in all elements including testicle size weight and symmetry, scrotum wrinkling, moles rolls factor, pubic hair trimming, as well as aftermarket decorative elements like jeweled cock rings.

In order to obtain a complete scientific understanding of a particular penis, the penis in question must be submitted to the Uniform Penis Measurement Standard (UPMS) and the True Penis (TP) examination protocols. The Uniform Penis Measurement Standard uses the [Archimedes principle](https://youtu.be/lQEUDsn0p80?t=165) to obtain a volumetric measure of a particular penis. In order to conduct this highly scientific clinical measurement a penis is inserted into a large beaker of 37C distilled water which sits on a scale tared to zero grams. Although a true stoic alpha can obviously maintain an erection during even extremely adverse physical conditions, through extensive testing it was found that the variability of a flaccid penis's volume when inserted into room temperature or colder water was unacceptably high, so body temperature water is recommended for this test. The buoyant force of the water acting upon the inserted penis manifests as an apparent change in the scale's reading, which is then transformed into the desired volume measurement by using rho = ~ 0.993 g/cm3 at 37C for water. This measurement should be repeated at least three times, under both fully erect and flaccid penile states. Despite the objective nature of this measurement, an impartial referee or other official governing body must still be present to observe the procedure to ensure that 1) the scale is indeed tared at the start of the measurement 2) only the shaft is inserted into the water and not additional appendages or foreign objects 3) that the penis is, indeed, completely flaccid for the flaccid portion of this measurement 4) the measurement is not compromised by unnecessary movement or splashing. The use of a shrill whistle or other auditory feedback device during the test by the referee is encouraged to ensure compliance with the Uniform Penis Measurement Standard protocol.

While the UPMS is an objective volumetric measure. True Penis (TP) is a holistic multivariate analysis of all genital aesthetic elements assessed at a 1-10 scale. In order to submit a penis for TP assay, a photograph of both erect and flacid forms must be submitted to a certified TP specialist. These Rational Males have dedicated their entire lives to analyzing men's penises. In fact they are so invested in penile assessment that they have little time to invest in physical health, masculinity or serious intellectual endeavors. All these men have time for is assessing and analysing cocks which is why they are exempt from Red Pill's lifting requirements. If you're are interested in undergoing a TP assessment do not hesitate to contact our specialists. They love getting paid to stare at cocks almost as much as they hate lifting and will get back to you promptly with the proper information on how to submit your specimen.

Now that we have an understanding of the protocols and procedures needed to obtain a complete scientific measurement of a particular penis, the next logical step is interpreting the result. You got your numbers back and their not very good. What do you do now? If that's the case simply abandon hardline biological determinism and adopt a liberal subjectivist attitude. Don't be ashamed to revert to determinism at a later date if it suits your egoic fulfilment. TRP is not about what size of dick is best, but how to have the BEST dick no matter what that means to you. It could be no dick at all.

At this point you have two options: self improvement or self delusion, although the two are not mutually exclusive. Jelquing is the art of pulling on your ding ding in a desperate attempt to make it bigger. It's not about the penis you currently have, its about the penis you one day will have. Jelquing requires patience effort and consistency, qualities that are in short supply among redditers. The second option is ""Faking It Till You Make It"". Pretending the issue is resolved is much easier than actually doing anything about it. Buy a dick sleeve. Using a fixadent like product glue your penis into the dick sleeve. Don't worry about the logistical nightmare of having a plastic penis glued onto your real penis. It's not about the reality of your penis, its about her perceived reality of your penis. 

This brings me to the deep philosophical conclusion 80% of the Red Pill will never comprehend. Is penis measuring both in the literal and metaphorical sense a coping mechanism for living in a castrating NeoLiberal society? Man feels castrated by society so he measures his penis in a desperate attempt to affirm that it is still there. Isn't measuring the penis a castrating act unto itself which inevitably leads to a positive feedback loop of more measurement? Furthermore if penile measurement is itself a symptom shouldn't we seek to overcome it rather than endlessly enjoying the symptom? Isn't it true that the more empirical a man is the more castrated, humorless, boring and lifeless he is? Aren'tt impulsivity and spontaneity key traits that make a man attractive? Then why are we striving for the exact opposite in a community dedicated to helping men get laid? Finally since women find humorless scientific empiricists boring and unattractive shouldn't you instead strive to be a fun guy who writes April Fool's day posts?

813,fsz5yy,"Confidence is very difficult to tackle because of how blurry the entire concept is. It's often touted as some ethereal concept that you either have or don't have, or that if you just do this one quick thing you'll suddenly be confident. That's all bullshit. As someone who went from lacking it in many aspects of my life to being someone quite sure of themselves, I've weaved through a lot of the crap and stuck with what works and it's really quite simple.

Firstly, you have to understand what confidence is: Confidence ultimately comes down to ones perception of their own self in any particular scenario. How competently you view yourself to be at any given task will determine how much confidence you have in yourself. If you fancy yourself to be good at something, you'll have confidence, if you think you're terrible at it, you'll lack confidence. 

Take driving for example, if you were driving a car for the first time you'd have zero self confidence in your ability. You'd be nervous, anxious and concerned that you may have an accident because you simply don't know how to do it. However, over time as you do it more and more, the more you practice, the better you'll become. After enough practice you'll be able to drive quite competently and the nervousness and anxiety  will dissipate. Eventually you'll get behind the wheel and it will become a mindless task because you've done it so many times before successfully. This is confidence in your driving ability.

This is how your mind and confidence work and you can map it out onto almost anything. If you lack confidence talking to girls, or with your job, or with public speaking it's simply because you haven't practiced it enough or been successful at it enough to be sure of yourself. Your mind recognizes the novelty of it and becomes tentative. The only way to build confidence is to practice it repeatedly until you internalize that you're proficient at it. You need to practice talking to girls, your job or public speaking, become better at it and it and eventually it will become a mindless task the same way driving does, but it takes time. 

Contrary to buzzfeed articles, there are no quick fixes and there are no shortcuts. Most people try something once or a couple times and then tell themselves they don't have no confidence and give up and that's fine, most people lack discipline. If you want to gain confidence you need to understand that the payoff is always gonna be way down the line, compound interest. You just need to have the patience and perseverance to get there. The human mind takes a long time to internalize change. 

The last and most sobering realization is that you won't be able to have a high level of confidence with everything. You'll find somethings you have a knack for and it takes very little practice to become competent(and therefore confident) and there's other things that you can practice a whole lot and don't become very confident at all and this is fine. We're not all gonna be Michael Jordan's or Don Juan's, but you can become better at almost anything by practicing it repeatedly and with that comes more confidence.",813,2.0,0.6646999716758728,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck"

**If masculinity is power, there is a defiance in masculinity.** The masculine man lives on his own terms, resisting the world’s inertia insisting he conform. He assesses risk and reward, and takes pride in making his own decisions.

No better a glimpse of defiant masculinity than the combat sports fighter. He understands the game- he evaluates the risk, he visualizes the reward. Even the losing fighter garners the respect of participation- the only participation trophy that matters- and walks away with a warrior’s honor and the gorgeous women who find that irresistible.

**The feminized world cannot come to grips with the defiance of masculinity.** It misunderstands the high-risk/high-reward dichotomy and believes the participants are *unaware* of the risks or else they wouldn’t hunt for the rewards. The feminized worldview is steeped in consumerism- the proverbial activity punch-card at summer camp; the bucket-list life- where the longer life is understood as the better life. If not for a long life, how else will you enjoy food, wine, and travel?

This worldview is ideal for women, who are natural consumers. **Western civilization has always been arranged for female comfort, and without the constraints of expectation- modern women are no longer expected to be… much of anything**- life becomes an endless summer camp.

The bugman exists as an infection of consumerism. To the bugman, there is no higher degree of satisfaction than money and women- not wicked in their own right, but neither should be ends in themselves. **The masculine man will demand a deeper experience, spitting in the face of risk to attain something which transcends what the bug can understand.** When a bug’s goal is money and women they’ll settle for achieving either with the least amount of energy exerted- leaving them enslaved to a master both at home and at work.

Productivity can be an abyss.

**When a man transcends the feminine, summer camp, bucket-list life and becomes attune to looking at his time on Earth as productivity maximization**- pure creative output, total content-mindset- he looks for ways to squeeze the most blood from a stone. How can I sleep best, when it’s time to sleep, and work hardest when it’s time to work- risks, be damned. It was toward the waning days of Spring when I discovered Kratom.

815,fsc92e,"So I’m going to tell you guys about STIs I caught while wearing a condom. Recently contracted Molluscum Contagiosum from a plate I used to hook up with a few months back.

I also caught genital warts in the past (gross af). I managed to napalm them off with a soldering iron and fix it (it doesn’t leave scars boys, unless it’s on your cock or scrotum, leave that to the professionals). Compared to molluscum, hpv warts are a breeze, easier to contain and you can still have a sex life.

These molluscum things are a different story. They spread like wild fire. Doctors don’t take it seriously, in fact no one does, so the choices for treatment are limited. And you’ll have to insist, because most doctors will tell you to leave it because it “resolves on its own”. Do your research and you’ll see what I mean.

Tips to make sure the lady you’re about to smash is STI/STD free. (Obviously, wear a condom)

1: TURN THE LIGHT ON, MAKE IT BRIGHT AND CLINICAL.

2: Know how to distinguish between folliculitis (shaving bumps) and actual STIs.

3: Take your time when looking, don’t rush it. You can go down there, pleasure her while looking without putting your mouth on it.

4: Ask her if she’s clean (in some countries if you contract an STD from someone and they don’t let you know you can sue)

5: If the paranoia gets to you, fuck her while in boxers (the kind that has an opening in front). This is last resort and for the true warriors who don’t mind looking like a twat while shagging.

Tips for living with these 2 STIs:

1: It takes time for your body to fight the virus, you have to be on top of it and halt the spread, every bit helps.

2: If you’re about to hook up and you’re infectious, be honest, if she isn’t down, you’ll eventually find a girl who is. I’ve done it and you can too. If you take the right precautions, you can be safe. Just be smart.

3: Be healthy, eat the right things, don’t drink or smoke too much and exercise often.

4: Don’t beat yourself up about it. Shit happens, be thankful it isn’t something worse.

5: Keep talking to women.

Tl;dr - turn the fucking light on and know what you’re looking for

EDIT - yes, I didn’t do the check (duh) So that’s why I’m telling you cunts now, CHECK and KNOW what to look for. I could’ve avoided this and the thousands I’ve spent on doctors appointments if I just did the check. Molluscum is tricky, you have to know the difference between molluscum bumps and folliculitis. Don’t be fooled, molluscum cases are rapidly increasing

816,frmzf8,"Five years ago, I left the small town I grew up in to move to the big city and begin university for the second time. I was extremely driven at the time for not only by the career prospects of doing a PhD, but also by the social opportunities of living in the UK's second biggest city. 

  
Previously being very shy and inexperienced socially, I threw myself into he social environment and nightlife of my new home. I was out on the town twice a week, and going too peoples homes as well to relax most evening.

  
Whilst I felt my confidence grew, and I was unaware of a insecurity that was taking seed in me: The expectation I had for myself to be out and socializing all the time. 

When Friday or Saturday lunch time would come around, I'd start messaging friends the classic 'Wuu2' to see what was up. If it turns out that my close friends where busy or not going out, and I begin to panic. ""I don't have any friends going out tonight, that means I'm going to be stuck indoors on a Friday night like a friendless looser!"".

I use to get really anxious about not going out, I use to try 'booking' people into going out a weekend or so in advance just so I felt secure. One Friday night, I was having the usually stuck in doors panic when it struck me ""No one fives a fuck what I'm doing tonight"" and with that revelation, I slammed my PS3 on and played Final Fantasy all night.  


I didn't get into a habit of playing Computer games on a weekend after this, but I did feel more comfortable leading up to the weekend and when I didn't go out. I also probably got on with my friends more, being less manipulative in trying to get them to go out.  


Fast forward 7 years to today, and these old securities are plaguing me. I live in a small town, with most of my close friends being an hour and a half away. I have to make an effort to drive to see them at least once a month, otherwise I start to feel like a friendless failure, watching life go by.  


The UK has been on quarantine for two weeks now. I've not seen face-to-face anyone but my parents and sister. It around this time that I should be feeling anxious and self-pressured to go and see people, but instead, I'm perfectly fine. The quarantine has imposed a hard limit on me seeing people, and as a result, I'm fine with my seclusion.   


I spent this weekend cleaning up, organizing both myself both physically and mentally, meditating, and sending funny meme's to my close friends. If I hadn't been for this hard limit, I'd start to feel stressed and anxious, but those are just due to my expectations, they're not due to any actual sense of loneliness.  


This week I learnt that I am totally happy by myself, and that I need to use that a solid foundation to build both my personal and social life.",816,3.0,0.36410000920295715,"people, feminist, sex, year, well, live, actually, let, question, great"
817,frtveo,"**In a flash Fake Winehouse was able to transform our hetero-normative experience back into something she was more comfortable with**, her own safe space of *gender neutrality*, with the magic words: “get this shit off me.” Tossing her the tissue box, I chastised her for *breaking the narrative*, something usually reserved for slightly longer than fifteen seconds after sex.

Winehouse may have rolled her eyes, but the fact of the matter remains: **sex is the narrative of attraction**. For the red-hot 20 minutes I spent with Amy, she behaved like the ideal submissive- this is what she wanted in the moment. After, when her big girl brain came back, the feminist became disgusted with herself, and, “get this shit off me,” was her way of re-framing the mess she’d made by bending to my will.

**Sex is like editing together a documentary film. Everything is based in reality, but it’s up to you to put together the story. Initial attraction may be there, but if you don’t string things together the right way, you’re not getting laid.**

Both sexes have their role in building this narrative. It’s too easy to reduce the female’s role to that of a movie goer or theater attendee; “just start the damn show and hope I don’t walk out.” Although there is truth to that dynamic, the woman has her part in showing up *fit for the performance*.

If she’s had the bad luck of being out with a doofus, only minimal effort is required. The slightest exertion of feminine prowess will allow her total control of the situation. These aesthetic stakes will rise along-side the value of the man interested. By the time she shows up to the date, he’ll already know if he wants to fuck her or not- from there, as long as she doesn’t commit an egregious, narrative disrupting crime of anti-sexuality, her job is mostly done- any further action on her part is for sport.

As a man falls under the aesthetic spell of a woman, he’ll construct the rest of the narrative on his own with very little input from her. Did she try to make a joke? It’s hysterical! Did she make a rather obvious observation? She’s so smart! Is there any kind of minor nuance to her behavior that can be focused on and doted over? She’s adorable!

His misguided interpretation of her qualities will remain until his attraction for her has been extinguished, which may be accompanied by feelings of sadness, guilt, shame, or even disgust, depending on the particulars of the situation.

Since anything beyond her aesthetic may be his narrative imposing on reality, there isn’t a lingering question of authenticity. Ironically, the authenticity of her beauty is actually debatable- women have an entire arsenal of weapons to deceive the gullible- however, most men are only looking for surface level approval.

Conversely, **authenticity is a central question for her- an on-going issue to which her attraction to him is contingent upon.**

She will also see what she wants and lie to herself, but rather than constructing a false narrative based on his aesthetic, she magnifies the fragments of his personality that she finds attractive and comes to the conclusion that he “must always be like that.”

This is as much a naive fantasy as his personifying her beauty into the idealized girlfriend. While he’s putting his best foot forward on their date in an attempt to have a sex worthy performance, she’s going along for the ride believing that he’s being himself and this decisive, assertive, cool and confident guy is *just who he is*.

Only it isn’t so easy- women are savvier in this department than men. **She’ll subconsciously match his behavior to what he looks like while trying to determine if he should be entitled to acting so decisive, assertive, cool and confident. And if this scan turns up negative, she’ll think he’s faking his swagger and aggressively test the depth of his authenticity.**

If he’s able to hold this frame together for long enough, he’ll get laid.

**All human relationships contain a degree of narrative, requiring effort and social pruning, because we’re really just animals on a dirty rock floating in space.** But, yes, we have the capacity of forming intimate relationships with one another, and that can be a great experience… or a devastatingly disappointing experience… or something so torturous that it becomes mentally crippling. Even the bonds of family are held together by narrative- and if this seems inaccurate to you, you likely don’t know the pain of a distant mother or an absent father… or, even a murderous mother.

**There is no greater emotional pain than of a narrative dissolving.** Death, of course, is the ultimate narrative dissolution… but short of an ending so dramatic, there is an element of innocence lost for good when a relationship falls into disrepair. When you can take a step back and recognize the true peak, the trust and good feelings that went with it, and even if you’re not conscious of the narrative elements that engendered the connection, you’re highly aware of your new status as strangers.

If we can crystallize heartbreak to a single moment, it would be the intersection between confidant and stranger.

818,frrlae,"I’m currently a 20-year-old college student. I’m in my second year. The most important thing I did for my social life was to join a fraternity. 

Before I get into the details of why joining a fraternity can positively impact your social life and your game with girls, I want to talk a little bit about my past. 

High school was hell for me. It was the worst experience of my life. I didn’t really have friends despite desperately wanting to be popular. The friends that I did have were also kind of losers like me. Great guys, but we never really had the fun that the popular guys had.  I never went to parties. I never even had kissed at girl in high school. This partly had to do with the way I was raised. 

I decided to go to a college that was several hours away from home. First year was okay. I made some friends, went to some parties… But there was something missing. 

I struggled making “real” friends and having a group to belong to. The parties and social events that I did go to were never truly organized. They sort of just happened. I made some friends, but I did not have an abundance of friends. 

This year, everything changed. A couple guys from one of my classes were part of a frat. At the time, I didn’t really know much about what a frat was. Like everyone else, I had all these negative connotations associated with the word. “All they do is drink and party”. “You have to pay to have friends, how stupid is that”. 

Turns out, I couldn’t be more wrong. I remembered that a few guys on this subreddit had talked about the benefits of a frat. So, I decided to express some interest early in the process. 

The two guys from my class took a liking of me. They invited me to a couple invents so that I could meet the rest of the guys. I thought it was a great group of guys and they liked me too. 

I met some of the other potential pledges (people thinking about joining), and I liked them too. I convinced a couple friends of mine to join with me, and they did. My social life, and my game have greatly improved as a result. Without further ado, here are the 3 reasons why you should join a frat if you’re in college: 

**1) Abundance.** 

As I talked about, I now have an abundance of parties and social events that I can go to. I have a fee that I pay every semester, but that’s about it. Almost all these events are optional. It’s a great way to go out and have fun. Also, you’re no longer the guy who’s actively searching for fun stuff to do. Instead, you’re the guy in control. You get to invite people and throw parties. I no longer feel desperate for friends or for fun. I have an abundance of it. With this, comes a very attractive and calm attitude. Furthermore, the friendships that I made feel real to me.

**2) Networking, Career and Philanthropy.**  

A frat isn’t just about the parties. Most of the guys in my frat are in my program. Some are older than me and have access to notes and textbooks that they can lend me. Some have great advice on what courses to take, how to manage money…The frat that I now belong to, is a big one in North America. Some very successful people have been a part of it throughout the years. This can be very helpful for your career. We also have a ton of philanthropy events. We get to go out and help the community and just be good human beings. 

**3) Girls.** 

Now that I’m in a frat, it’s much easier to meet girls. One way is through the parties and social events that we have every week. But we also have relations with sororities and events with them. Joining a frat is like social circle game to the max, at least from my experience. A lot of the frat guys have a lot of friends who are girls, so you’re bound to meet them at some point. Then you’re circle just keeps getting bigger and bigger. With that, your confidence increases. 

In conclusion, a frat can help you with just about everything when you’re in college. With girls, with having an abundance of options when it comes to events and parties, with school grades, with networking, with career options, and even with philanthropy and building yourself as a man. 

Overall, it’s been a great experience for me. I don’t think it’s for everyone. But if you are anything like who I was, someone who was really struggling socially and needed a group to belong to. Someone who quite honestly didn’t really have the balls for cold approach. Someone who often found himself in isolation. Someone who was hungry for success in other areas of life, such as business, but who couldn’t quite concentrate because his social needs weren’t being met. If you are anything like I used to be, then consider joining a frat. 

The most important thing is to meet the people that a part of it. Make sure you vibe with them. Make sure that you can see these people as your friends, most importantly the other people thinking of joining (since you’ll be spending most of your time with them at first). Maybe try to get a couple of your friends involved with you, if you have friends. Of course, make sure that you have the means to be paying their fee every semester.

819,fre0a5,"I made a comment a while back on a guide on how to max your looks, I was surprised to find out that a couple of members messaged me to make a thread on this stuff. 

Here we are.

&#x200B;

**Why should you improve your looks?**

If you truly think that looks do not matter you are truly delusional and the circle jerk of ""Red Pill"" nowadays has gotten to your head, I am sorry to all TRP funs but I've been here long enough to realize that the circle jerk and YouTubers filling this sub with recycled content is beyond control. 

Yes, looks do matter and it's something that everyone in the Red Pill community should try to improve if you don't try to improve your looks you are not someone who *lives* the Red Pill lifestyle in my books.

Plus this is evidence-backed, do your own research.

# Haircut & Facial Hair

**Balding** ***-*** If you are **CURRENTLY** balding (receding hairline), buy a derma roller (along with minoxidil) as your first line of defense and use some DHT blockers(this needs more research on your part). [https://moreplatesmoredates.com](https://moreplatesmoredates.com/) blog and YouTube channel has some of the best content on the subject.

&#x200B;

**Bald -** If you are already bald there are three things you can do. Embrace it and go on from there, but yes being bald will ""decrease your SMV"" but there are plenty chicks out there that will be more than willing to rub their pussy in your shiny head or get a Toupée. The best solution would be to do a hair transplant, costly but probably your best option for natural-looking hair.

&#x200B;

**Haircut -** Your haircut plays a major factor on how good you look. The best styles are the ones that fit your face shape the best. There are \~6 of face shapes: Oval, round, square, heart, rectangle (aka oblong), and diamond.

&#x200B;

>***Oval*** Face is longer than it is wide, with the jaw being a bit more narrow than the forehead. The jaw is slightly narrower than the forehead and tapers down towards the chin. Lines are fairly soft.  
>  
>***Round*** Babyface basically. Like oval but with vertical and horizontal ratios being almost identical.  
>  
>***Square*** Like a round face but with hard edges. Prominent jawline and compact midface.  
>  
>***Heart*** Prominent forehead tapering down into narrow or pointed chin.  
>  
>***Rectangle*** like oval but with sharper lines. leads to typical horse face appearance.  
>  
>***Diamond*** like oval but cheekbones are the widest part. narrow forehead and chin area with angular bone structure. Usually somewhat large gonial angle and high hyoid bone.

&#x200B;

After you have identified your face shape what cut should you get for it?

>**OVAL:**  
>  
>Very versatile. One of the most “flexible” face shapes feel free to experiment tend to look better with short styles.  
>  
>*Caution:* Stay away from too much height/volume on top.  
>  
>**ROUND:**  
>  
>Keep hair short on sides and back, long on top. Volume/height products are your best friend, try and grow facial hair.  
>  
>**SQUARE:**  
>  
>Hair should aim to soften the harsh lines of the upper face. Messy, medium length hair is the best bet. This is the best type of shape to pull off a buzzcut, use facial hair to soften harsh jaw angle  
>  
>**HEART:**  
>  
>Stay the fuck away from short hair, use long or medium length up top swept over to mask large forehead. Use facial hair to fill out jaw  
>  
>**RECTANGLE:**  
>  
>Stay away from short sides or cuts that give volume up top, don’t grow a beard.  
>  
>You can probably pull off slicked back hair.  
>  
>**DIAMOND:**  
>  
>Go with a fringe, long on top covering some of the forehead.  
>  
>You can grow facial hair or not, up to you.

If you are still not sure Instagram models, Tumblr, fashion blogs and Pinterest are your friends.

DO NOT cheap out and go on a shitty barber, most of them have no idea how to style and cut hair for specific face shape. Go to a professional and when the cut is done take some pics that you can so to your barber for reference and hopefully he doesn't fuck it up.

&#x200B;

**Beard -** Watch [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLLaHc22qAU) video, If you can't grow a beard and it makes you look like a Shaggy from Scooby-Doo knock off, then cut that shit. 

&#x200B;

# Skin

**Acne -** If your acne is hormonal then you have to let do its work, you can hop over the skincareaddiction subreddit and other skincare subreddits for advice on how to handle the situation and improve it. If you are not in your teens that means that there is something wrong with you, thus you have acne. This probably is your diet (which will discuss later on) or other issues, once again skincareaddiction subreddit is your friend, but make sure to check with your doctor.

&#x200B;

**Skin Texture -** I am using Tretinoin for this, however, this can also fuck up your skin so do your own research. Skincare subs are your holy grail for this.

&#x200B;

**Tan -** Tanning can greatly improve someone's appearance, please do not use those tanning creams that at the end make you look like some Manchester Girl.

You should aim for a Medium Brown color [here is a reference image on tanning levels.](https://1luicn4uholwsc2jlmo5w1ad-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/evoderma-fitzpatrick-skin-tone-scale-SM.png) 

How should you tan? Other than sprays and creams which are temporary and can make you look like the annoying orange, I suggest you go to a Tanning bed or even better a Beach.

If you can't tan for shit or in general want to tan faster lookup ""Melanotan 2"" and read up on it, the Peptides sub might come in a handful (be careful with this, this stuff ain't something to mess around with and the boners from it are no joke).

&#x200B;

# Diet and Fitness

**Diet -** Diet is a controversial subject, no, it's not that I am scared that vegan soy boys will come after me but simply that you have to see how you react to specific food and act accordingly, I cannot tolerate carbs thus I went with SCD (Specific Carbohydrate Diet from the book ""Breaking the Vicious Cycle"" the book is worth a read especially if you suffer from Crohn's/IBD, etc).

In my opinion, start with a Ray Peat inspired diet such as [Thermo30](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1153/7200/files/Thermo30_Fat_Loss.png?v=1524509549) or this one.

>Arugula  
>  
>Pomegranate

&#x200B;

**Fitness -** Lift weights(make sure to have correct form otherwise you are stupid), do HIIT  and use the Buteyko method. Maybe some calisthenics for showing off. 

You should aim to stay at around 12% BodyFat since that is where most people look the best.

Jeff Nippard, Jeff Cavaliere, MorePlatesMoreDates and my personal favourite John Meadows are your friends. Don't fall for traps like ""6 minute abs"" bullshit.

**DO NOT, buy workout programs,** without trying them first. 

[http://well-trodden10.rssing.com/chan-6614317/all\_p1048.html](http://well-trodden10.rssing.com/chan-6614317/all_p1048.html) they archive the 7chan board of fitness, people share programs there. Try out a program and then buy it from the creator, people may disagree with me on this but this is safer than falling for shitty workout programs.

821,fr4t4z,"So I met this girl on campus. Was waiting with a bunch of friends to go climbing with the climbing club, and saw her walking past: blonde, tan, long legs in tight shorts. Damn, better get me a girl like that, I thought. Well she walks over to us. She’s here to try out climbing. Nice.

We all take the train together. I catch her name and find out she’s a medical student. Quickly see the twitchy neurosis and snarling rage hidden behind her eyes. This girl has a good dose of angry crazy, easy to tell. Very tightly wound. I’m kind of into it. After initial greetings I ignore her to speak to my friend. There’s another guy in the group obviously hitting on her and telling her his life story. Do I attempt to speak to her more? No.

We get to the climbing wall and as regulars of the club it’s our responsibility to teach the newbies how to tie in and belay and all that so they don’t kill themselves or their partners. I could have offered to teach her, and she looks at me imploringly. But I don’t. I teach some Asian kid instead and she gets paired with blabbermouth who eagerly jumps at the chance. She looks mildly disappointed. Do I try to spend more time with her? No. In fact, I ignore her the rest of the day and leave at the end without saying a word to her.
_________________________________________________________

A week or so later I decide to go to a hiking club meet. We’re doing a short walk and then going to a pub to socialise. Whatdy’know, med student girl is there again, looking fine as ever and very North Face. After initial greetings and “oh we met before” I ignore her for the rest of the walk, and speak to *everyone else except her*.
 
At the pub half the people leave and we all sit down to get drinks. I’m speaking to everyone including her now, as we’re in a group. Conversation is quite good and I can tell she’s pretty smart, but ofc, wound up in the “I hate myself but I’ll take it out on everyone else” kind of way. Other guys are all interrupting each other to get a word in with her.  

There’s a really cute goth bartender at the bar. Has the kind of sleepy, spaced out vibe to her. One of the guys obviously has a crush on her because he can’t stop staring and keeps going over to get drinks directly from her. I tell him to just go for it, hit on her bro. He’s like, nah… too scared. I say “If you don’t hit on her I will”, he says “be my guest”. The med girl is grinning at me like “is he actually going to do it?”, and ofc, I get up, walk over to her, tell her she’s really cute. “When does your shift end?” she tells me a time which was much later; normally I’d wait around to meet them if it was soon but that won’t happen this time. “Okay can I get your number then?”, she’s quite taken aback and of course says yes. “Do you get many guys hitting on you then?” I ask her, “Not really” she says, and blushes.

I walk back to the table and they’re all mouths agape impressed like I’d just did a backflip or something. “Whoah dude that was smooth”, “Thanks”. Blondie is grinning with her big white teeth and giving me the “bend me over and fuck me right now” eyes.  The guy next to me asks me (out of earshot of medthot) how I learned to do something like that and I tell him “practice, after failing many, many times and embarrassing myself”. 

As the people trickle away over time I’m left talking to medthot. We have a nice conversation and I tell her I’ll take her climbing sometime again. She’s totally up for it and gives me her number. Important note here: plausible deniability. It’s not a date, I didn’t ask her out. I said I’d take her climbing. I’m doing *her* a favour, imparting my experience onto her. It’s just friendly, there’s no way I’m doing it because I want my dick inside her. Obviously….

____________________________________________________________

So a week later I text her out of the blue telling her I’m going climbing on Wednesday if she wants to come.  She replies like five times, and then bombards me with texts on the day as well like “I will be 5 mins late”, “where are you?”, “I’m nervous haha”, “Do I need this and that etc etc etc”. I ignore most of them and reply with one word to the relevant ones. Text message ratio is like 5:95 me to her, at this point I know I have her.

So we go climbing and it’s more time to speak together more intimately and I tease her and make jokes about her competence and I use the excuse of tying her in and helping her out to put my hands on her, her hips, her waist, her hair etc. She’s blushing and I think getting a bit turned on and after we finish I just leave. Don’t ask her to extend the date or anything… well it was just platonic climbing together after all right? She’s a bit disappointed by this and asks me if we’ll go climbing again soon and I say maybe and leave. 

Do I beg to see her again? Do I make her any promises? No. Left her hanging completely.
______________________________________

Well another week later where I don’t message her at all, I text her that I’m going to a party and she should come with me. Ofc she plays a bit coy at first like “I might be busy, who’s party idk the people etc etc” but I just ignore the texts entirely. On the day of the party I text “I’ll pick you up from your place where do you live?” and she sends me the address. 

So I meet her at the front door and she’s all Urban Outfitters and looks nice, and we go to get booze and walk to the house party. As we walk we have a dark conversation and I can really pick up on her overt rage and superiority complex; she is a med student and I’m not and that makes her better than me. To be fair, she must be really smart, she gets great grades and I wouldn’t be able to get her grades or even get accepted onto her course, so her raw power and anger translates somewhere. But it also means she belittles literally everyone else who isn’t a Med student and thinks of herself as queen. 

We get to the party and there’s barely anyone there, we’re not that early, and the people there are kinda nerdy, I cringe because I took this girl to a lame party. But do I apologise and make excuses? Nah, I just go with it. We meet all my friends who I haven’t seen in a while, and they’re used to me bringing a conveyer belt of girls to these things and they talk about all the usual things “where are you from, what do you study” etc. I can see just how proud she is whenever she says “I study medicine”. It’s so funny. My friends respect me a bit more now because she isn’t just a dumb bimbo and she’s also hottest girl at the party by far.

Well the party fills up with actual cool people eventually and as it does so I don’t trail around with her like a dog. I let her do her own thing and go and hang out with other people. We bump into each other occasionally and at one point another girl shows up who’s tied for or even slightly hotter than her and I can tell she hates her immediately. The girl, who I have history with, is polite and friendly with everyone but literally ignores me and medthot.  Medthot seems a bit insulted by this. A bit later on she asks me if I’m going to hit on her like I did with the bartender, in a jokey way of course, and I tell her “No, not with her, we don’t have a good relationship, we ignore each other now”.

This set her cogs turning and she starts asking me more questions about her and I tell her, “I don’t want to talk about it. Drop it” and she says “Oh, okay” and does. Truth is, this girl rejected me recently and was very bitchy about it, I hit on her quite overtly and she was disgusted by it. Now she ignores me and thinks I’m a creep. That’s fine… but medthot doesn’t need to know this, and I can spin it in such a way that she thinks we fucked or something. Plus I can rub medthot in rejection girls face. 

So we’re going round the party and another dude shows up. He is an acquaintance of mine, friend of my friends, and we’re on good terms but not exactly close. He’s fucked girls I’ve been into and I’ve fucked girls he’s been into and it’s stupid to say there’s a rivalry there but I think there is, even though it’s dumb. He is very handsome, more attractive than me, has a chill stoner vibe, and now the chaddest guy at the party. Whatever, I’ll only get mogged if I allow myself to get mogged. We have a friendly chat and I can see that he’s taking an interest in medthot and she’s taking glances at him. Great.

So what are my options? Guard her all night, be cold and distanced, tell her to stay away from him, or just sit back and let it happen? Well there’s only one option really. I introduced them to each other. Not doing so implies saltiness, and I had to be courteous to save face and keep that dgaf vibe. I could see the hungry “wow he’s hot” sparkle in her eye which feltbadman, and he was being really smooth and chill with her and they were focusing the conversation at each other and I started to feel like a fucking thirdwheel so I left to talk to some other girls. 

Idk what they spoke about but eventually she came back to me and we had a good time the rest of the party, shared a few cigarettes with otherChad, and then left. I told her I would walk her home. Important that there was precedent that I picked her up from her place, now it’s not about discovering her house for the first time, but instead taking her back to somewhere familiar.

I kiss her on the journey there and hold her hand and when we get to her place I tell her that I need to pee (this was actually true) and she is hesitant but I think she was just looking for an excuse to let me in. We get up to her flat and I pee and then go into her bedroom and start kissing her and the rest is textbook, bit of ASD, but get through in the end and the sex was quite bad. She was eager yet inexperienced and I just collapsed, fell asleep and left in the morning.
______________________

I meet her one more time at my place a few days later. She was hesitant at first and had to wrangle a bit to get her to meet up again. Bad sign. I tell her we’re going to cook together. 

Cooking together is my favourite date of all because it sets a power dynamic and allows you to lead her, lets you show competence, gives her a plausibly deniable excuse to come to your place, and your bedroom is right within reach. Ticks all the boxes.

We cook pasta and salmon and I’m in charge and show her simple things like chopping onions. She doesn’t really know how because she’s a spoilt rich girl but she really enjoys being bossed around like this and the whole time I’m pinching her ass and kissing her and picking her up and just being affectionate in a way that she wasn’t used to. We go to my bedroom and she tells me her life story (god I’ve heard a million life stories by now) and I am resistant to telling her mine and remain mysterious and closed off. I do tell her that I’m not looking for a girlfriend and I’m seeing two other girls at the moment and she shouldn’t expect anything serious. She seems a bit taken aback but also impressed by this. I ask her to suck my dick and after some resistance she does so and it was the scariest and most aggressive blowjob of my life I thought she’d fucking rip my foreskin off she was so violent with that thing and I couldn’t cum out of fear so I told her to just lay down on my thigh and jerked off onto her face.

________________

Well a few days later I ask her to meet up again and she says we need to talk about something and I’m like “great… oh well”. And we meet in a park and she gives me this whole, “It’s the wrong time for me. I don’t want to be your third girlfriend. The way you talk about women offends me etc etc”. I tell her she’s being dramatic and acting like she’s in a reality tv show. She tells me that she told her friends all about me and they told her to run away because I’m a horrible person. Fucking “friends” man. Girl’s friends always sabotage it for each other. Always bitching at each other about their guys… and when is the advice ever “stay with him”? They’re always telling their friends to break up.

Whatever, cool, we won’t see each other anymore. “We’ll still talk though right?” She wants to keep me on as an orbiter. Lol. “No”. I tell her. “I will block your number”. “Oh, okay”. She looks sad about it.
__________________

I don’t block her number but I do ignore every text she sends me for the next few months. Polite things like “I just saw you on campus lol” or “Are you going climbing this week?” She’s trying to reconnect with me, by giving me openings to ask her out again, this is the way women do it, they’re never overt about wanting you back. I ignore her.

At climbing and the hiking trips I see her there. She looks very pretty. I ignore her and talk to other people. Sometimes I bring other girls that I’m dating, plates or potential plates that are prettier or more extraverted or blonder than her. She gives me quick glances but maintains her distance. I see it in her eyes, she wants me back. If the sex was better, maybe, but atm, nah….

______________________

A few weeks later I’m sitting at the cafeteria eating my lunch when I notice the chad from the party. We say hi and sit together. He asks me about the medthot and what happened between us. I tell him the truth. “We met like two times and she dumped me but tbh I don’t mind that much the sex was bad and she was really high maintentance and kind of crazy”.

He tells me that he’s been hooking up with her for a few months now and yes she is crazy. 

Of course... What did I expect?

I smile at him. I’m not actually as hurt as I thought I would be, in fact I find it kind of funny. If he was looking to get me upset or anything, it didn’t work.

“Well you lasted longer than I did bro haha” I tell him.

“Yeah man I went deep... it was bad”. He has to go to his class so we bump fists and I spend the rest of the day with a smile on my face and a good mood. Whores will be whores. Just accept it.
_____________________________________

I run into her a month later, on campus. I can’t just ignore her now because that would imply saltiness. We have a brief conversation. 

“I’m walking this way, walk with me?” I ask her. “Sure"" she says.

“I saw (otherChad) the other day” I say to her. She gives me that toothy grin again when I bring up his name. She didn’t think I knew, or at least didn’t expect me to mention him. She likes the idea of me finding out and being hurt. I can tell. It’s that bitter rage again. 

“What did he say?” She’s being hesitant to reveal too much. Probing.

“Oh, we just both agreed you’re crazy”

She laughs. “Well he’s just mad because I dumped him and he was *so* in love with me and got all emotional and wouldn’t stop texting me af-“

“Ah, ah” I put a finger to her lips. “I don’t want to hear it”.

“Don’t want to hear what?”

“I don’t want to hear you badmouthing my friends. That’s between you and him. You shouldn’t be telling me these things. I like him. I don’t want my perception of him changed”

“Oh okay” She looks a bit taken aback.

We walk in silence for a bit more.

“I’m going to a party this weekend if you want to come” she says.

I think about it. “Maybe”.

822,fqvksc,"A lot of us ended up on this sub for a simple reason: we wanted to get better with women. Why? Because we operated under the fallacy women would make us happy. For lots of us The Red Pill has 5 steps. 

1.) You read literature and it tells you to improve in certain areas of your life. You do what the literature says.

2.) The self improvement isn’t working nearly as fast as you’d like, so you complain. At this point people either stagnate and never pass this stage or continue to improve themselves regardless.

3.) Women begin showing attraction towards you. It appears the self improvement is working. Plus, you feel much happier then before.

4.) You slack on the improvement, now believing that you are good enough for any woman of your desires. Even though you continue to get laid you become less and less happy. As you become less happy you start getting laid less. At this point another crossroads presents itself. Either you backtrack to step 2 or ascend to step 5.

5.) You realize women were not the source of ur happiness in step 3. It was your self improvement. The women came because you were happy and improving. For many, they re-invigorate themselves and focus on self improvement again and become happy. For some, the happiness does not return.

Optional 6.) If you find yourself improving but remaining sad it is likely that the improvement you have laid out for yourself isn’t what you actually want to improve at. It is those that require a step 6 this post focuses on.

When I was in 8th grade, I was very happy. Why? I had improved from bronze 5 to platinum 5 in league of legends during the year. The happiness did not result from the actual achievement, but rather the journey of improvement. People experience happiness in the 3rd stage not just because they are improving at weight lifting and game, but because they are improving with women. Remember people often come to this sub for the sole reason of improving with women. This is what they wanted to improve and they are seeing the incremental improvement. 

The problem of stage 4 arises because getting women is not a goal that can provide incremental improvement for a long time. After a point, continuing to improve at the majority of goals given on this sub stop improving your ability to get women. For most of those that ascend to step 5, ascend because the goals given on this sub for instance, social confidence and fitness, become what they wish to improve at. 

The majority that fail to ascend, fail because they simply don’t enjoy those goals as much. Therefore, they miss the lesson of self improvement because they get less satisfaction from the basic goals given to teach this lesson. There are a few that ascend to 5, come to realize they don’t enjoy lifting and constant social confidence improvement as much as other avenues. These people continue on to step 6, discover what they love to improve at and understand that happiness does not come from a set of instructions given to you, but rather happiness comes from pursuing improvement in what you want. This could be a video game, ceramics, or raising kids. 

Don’t get me wrong, fitness and social ability are extremely important to well being, and I am not saying people should not keep the habit of lifting or socializing. Instead, I am saying don’t expect powerlifting or social mastery to be every persons key to happiness.

823,fq18vj,"When we were kids, our father used to be hard on us but our mothers used to give us emotional support everytime was asked them for her and share all our problems to her. This conditioning made us believe that somehow women in relationship will behave the same but that's contrary to our experience. Women don't like men who look for their supports ,they want men who are as strong as a stone but meriful to others.

There is a subbreddit loveafterporn  where women complained so much that they can't trust their partner no longer because they are struggling with porn and most of them even have hard time trusting their partners again once they know they were watching porn in the relationship or had watched porn previously.  I mean, when it comes to them, we are suppose to forget and forgive every chad/Tyrone they had hooked up with but they are not even to forget images of women we had seen although their feminists sisters encouraged to women to behave like sluts and do porn and when now, its coming and biting them in their asses  but somehow they are saying we are responsible for not controlling our urges. How ironic.

824,fq70b2,"**If you're new to THE RED PILL, forgive me if I give you some spoilers- if anything, I'm saying you time- yes, in fact, it's all bullshit.** Everything you've been told, is almost reliably, the opposite of the truth. One key to under standing the world is that *there are no small lies*, minor shifts in approximation or slight exaggerations- no, when lies are told, they are big lies- whoppers, total bullshit, the wool being pulled over your eyes- and **lies are usually the polar opposite of the truth.**

Take what we're told about FEMALE NATURE. We're told that women are naturally sweet, nurturing, understanding; trusting, humble, and submissive- all aspects of [femininity](http://archive.vn/gGQLH) that we're told *come naturally to women as FEMALE NATURE.*

This, my friends and brothers, is a lie- and the polar opposite is true.

Rolling things back to humans as *fancy animals.* Women are dick targets and baby ovens. Men are cum machines and lion killers. Everything on top of this are theatrics for one to attract the other. Anything on top of that are exceptional people doing exceptional things- but on the red pill, we don't concern ourselves with *exceptions to the rule.*

**The rule is that we are animals and we want to fuck...**

...in order to procreate, at least that's where the urge really comes from. And, again, men want the LARGEST NUMBER of women to (theoretically) inseminate and women want to select the BEST MEN to be (again, theoretically) inseminated by...

**Female nature is her quest to find the best men, with the best genetics, to have sex with.** We call this hypergamy, or the female instinct to *trade up*, always on the hunt to find a better mate and produce higher quality children (the latter, of course, is subconscious).

What is the problem here? Allowing this to run rampant, without restriction, will not produce strong societies or coherent civilizations. In other words, you're here, reading this on a smart phone, because of the limits put on human nature/female sexuality (again, dominant men looking to impregnate everything that moves and hypergamous women looking to abandon her prior husband and offspring in the face of a more dominant man)- we call these limits *marriage.*

Suddenly with the bond of marriage (either through the church or through the state, or both)- enforced by a strong social taboo against promiscuity and adultery- women were stuck with the man she chose at a young age, and cads (or, in modern terms, CHADS) had their dicks on a leash. If they wanted to make their marriage a happy and content one, that opportunity was available for them to take. For all the talk about having to do away with the rigid, TILL DEATH, institution of marriage, as it produced *unhappy people*, it was their own fault for not making the most of what they were given rather than faulting the glue we used to hold society together.

But, as it turns out- and as we're seeing now, with aging cat ladies and divorcees loading up on anti-depressants- marriage was actually the best arrangement for long term happiness. And, in order to get both men and women to subdue their inner nature, there needed to be a little bit of *brain trickery*, in the form of social programming and taboos.

**Femininity was a form of social programming.** Convince women to be trusting in her husband, humble in the face of his confidence and masculinity (as leader and head-of-household), and submissive to his leadership. These character traits that she was programmed with, and pressured to adhere to, necessitated that she make a good, long-term choice (a man who is emotionally stable, kind, dependable, etc.) as she would be punished by a poor long term choice. On the flipside, this encouraged men to be good men in order to attract good women, and have a *good marriage.* Everyone was putting their best food forward, or they didn't win the game.

Of course, to the surprise of no one, when feminism became the dominant ideology, they did away with any expectations fostered on women, creating circumstances for hypergamy to run wild, and for marriage (as we knew it) to die, dead as fucking dead. And, guess what bucko, all those social expectations are still placed on men- at least superficially- and **the real heart of our message on THE RED PILL is: the game ended a long time ago, so stop playing by fucking the rules.**

825,fpq047,"I keep hearing the term : ""It's always your fault"" all the time, but often it gets misunderstood.

*""My girfriend dumped me / Wife divorced me"" - Your fault.*

*""My parents were abusive to me as a child"" - Your fault. (Seriously WTF? Well unless you are Hindu or Buddhist or some mystic who can find out what you did in your past lives to deserve this...)*

*""I'm wasting my life"" - Your fault (well yes, in this case, it almost always is)*

*""I'm not genetically gifted with a superstar body and looks"" - Your fault*

*""My friend turned to alcohol and drug abuse and died"" - Your fault. (The Hell? I didn't make him drink!)*

*""I lost my job due to the recession"" - Your fault*

Fault is NOT a synonym for responsibility. Fault is explicitly a blame word, used when you have made a mistake, for the purpose of stimulating a feeling of guilt. I don't know who used the word fault in the first place (maybe it was JP?), but he did a crime by substituting the word ""fault"" for ""responsibility"".

In relationships it is a good way of blaming only the man and essentially absolving the woman of any sense of responsibility. Not only does reinforces the lack of empathy for the suffering, it usually just leads to anger and does not resolve the real problems.

A failure to distinguish between fault and responsibility can either lead a man to his awakening, or send him down the slippery slope of toxic shame, guilt and self destruction.

Plus we can always break our head over who's fault it was that caused shit to hit the fan, and hold the offender culpable, but no matter who did it, because it is happening in your life, you will be affected. Dealing with the results of the fallout will inevitably fall on your head and setting things right will be your responsibility. So you'll have to own it regardless of who's fault it was. 

The thing that gets so misunderstood is this -- when it comes to life, we have little control over a lot of things that happen to us. What we DO have control over (if we wake up and see) is the sense of ownership and responsibility - looking at what we can do with what life throws at us.

It can sometimes be a very small window - say just letting yourself spend a few minutes silently being a witness and allowing your thoughts and emotions flow out and dissipate, but it could make the difference between getting up and back on track after a breakup vs a downward spiral of self destruction.

Sometimes it can be a much bigger thing. Look at EVERYTHING that has been created and invented. What did our ancestors have? Nothing. Nothing, but some rocks and trees and animals. Starting from there, all of civilization has been created over time.

Let's just for argument's sake alone, consider that there's something called karma that caused you to land up where you are. But still, karma is not a term to justify you being a victim of fate and things not in your control. What it means is that you got here by what you were once responsible for. Your fate is the result of distant past responsibility and your past choices became your present fate. Karma means that your life has always been your responsibility and it is only awakening your sense of responsibility that can help you dig yourself out of the hole you've dug yourself into.

The term karma if you read it up, has never been used as an excuse to stay a victim who's merely reactive, but ultimately to take responsibility, which leads to a solution to your mess. 

This moment is the only moment where you can be truly responsible for what has happened, what is happening and what is to come. Now is the moment of responsibility. Now is the time to be responsible. 

Responsibility is the quality that allows you to proactively own your life and open the door to creating your life even from virtually nothing.

Being responsible awakens your inner creator and live consciously for once. Being reactive allows you to remain a victim, driven by a clueless subconscious. If anything, this is the ONLY choice you really have. Everything else flows from which frame you choose.

The more you come into the frame of ""It's my responsibility"", the more you get to live a conscious, proactive life of your own making where you find your creative capabilities finding expression.

So next time any of this happens to you, reframe it a little differently, and suddenly many possibilites open up. It is true, that necessity is the mother of invention, but only when you're responsible.

*""My girfriend dumped me / Wife divorced me"" - Your responsiblity. Kick depression, get healthier, get new better relationships.*

*""My parents were abusive to me as a child"" - Your responsibility. Find the tools to overcome your past, come to the present moment, and live truly again. Be the father to your children your parents never were.*

*""I'm wasting my life"" - Your responsibility. This can really be fixed in so many ways.*

*""I'm not genetically gifted with a superstar body and looks"" - Your responsibility. Find out what it takes to improve yourself. You'll soon see that good looks are almost always about a fit body, body language, good style and grooming. How did Joe Decker go from fatass to world's fittest man at one point?*

*""My friend turned to alcohol and drug abuse and died"" - Your responsibility. At least be the rock for his family, or in the long run do something to help people get their shit back on track. I know of one family who started a foundation and a hospital from seeing the death of their loved one.*

*""I lost my job due to the recession"" - Your responsibility. Who knows, you could end up on a new, better career path in a much better place (like me). You might even start your own venture maybe.*

Of course, if you do sit down and honestly look back, you will realize that in many of these situations lots of things were indeed due to your own mistakes and inexperience and you could certainly have done better in hindsight. But many of these lessons aren't learnt without going through the whole experience itself in the first place. However there are also many circumstances that simply aren't under your control either. And other people do exist and have played their own roles in how things turned out, for which they are accountable. 

But FAULT is something different from RESPONSIBILITY. Fault is usually content with blaming yourself (""I'm so bad"") or someone else (""I'm so good) for everything. Neither of the two are realistic. But it is responsibility that allows you to be real, own your life, grow and create from these moments, and inspire others to be responsible in turn.

826,fp8phs,"This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to self improve yourself with little distractions. A lot of us may have lost jobs or started working from home. Luckily everyone is in the same boat, there should be absolutely no complaining about the situation as a man.

I’ve noticed a lot of my beta friends/acquaintances have been lining up for welfare payments (I live in a lucky society where welfare payments in this current crisis are near my part time wage). Instead of using the money on self improvement they are all picking up bags of weed, gaming consoles and other dopamine hits.

Don’t become one of these people and use covid-19 as an excuse. This is a golden opportunity.

Working out from home is the new standard. Gyms are closed. Learn to enjoy this opportunity to improve your calisthenics skills if you don't own weights. Make sure you are adding weight and volume to your workouts consistently. Come out of quarantine more toned.

Earn income. I know a lot of people that have lost their jobs, but there are still ways to make money online. Now is a great time to begin chipping away at that business you always wanted to quit your job to begin. You need to get ahead of the pack in times like this. You can’t even be spinning plates during quarantine, so you have no excuses.

Invest. Asset prices are lower than they ever have been in recent memory, there is probably (definitely) more downside over the coming months. Now is the time to start dollar cost averaging and putting money in. Remember the central banks will shower more cash on the world economy, only furthering asset prices in the future when the quarantine is over and employment resumes.

Initiate a side hustle. The internet has so many opportunities to create revenue, turn your passion into a business to never work a day in your life. Even if you have a job, you need to be diversifying your income streams.

Hobbies. Follow your passions, girls don’t care what your passion is. Just have at least one. Bonus points for cool hobbies with the ladies.

Learn a language. It’s such a large goal, if you actually commit it will do plenty for your self motivation, goal setting, opportunities. memory and long term thinking skills.

Bonus: I went to Buenos Aires, Argentina last year and I was amazed with the quality of women there. I will admit I was staying in the rich area, but the men are so beta over there that it was easy to consistently score 8’s and 9’s. Learning the language would make these girls even easier as I was talking English on dates.

Don’t be wasting time on dating apps. Keep DMing girls on instagram to a low, always aim to be ignoring their DMs. Don’t invest time in being a girl's boredom killer, she will branch swing to the next best alpha when the quarantine is over and forget your emotional/boredom support during covid-19.

What I’m going to be doing:

* Learning Spanish
* Training hard
* Keeping my six pack
* Not drinking alcohol (I’ll save it for the crazy parties after lockdown ends)
* Working my part time job (Part time for work life balance)
* Creating digital products
* Learning to produce music
* Delete dating apps and ghost girls for mystery and efficiency
* No Fap
* Automating my job using Python.
* Keeping in strong contact with my bros.

If you don’t waste the next period, you will be launched back to reality with a new rhythm. You should have hobbies, be in great shape and have more money ready to cash in on how horny girls will be after the lockdown ends. Don’t become a loser and start smoking weed and playing games.

827,fpf095,"I've been lurking here for a long time, and found out about the red pill through the MGTOW subreddit. Joined maybe 6-8 months ago. I remember reading something, somewhere here, about the need to move on from your mother, as she is your first love as a boy (male). As I have been absorbing the gold lined pages of wisdom from the many of you veterans here, I have begun to filter my entire world through a red lens. I see the light! What I would like to focus on, is how simply absorbing, analyzing and meditating on vital information can change your actions. Slowly, but it all starts with a thought.

I grew up in a soviet immigrant family. I was born in the states, but my parents came out of the USSR in the very late 80's. They started with nothing and now have the american dream, somewhat. My dad is typical alpha male, and my mom, he probably married her because shes a fantastic house wife. But her brain, even though growing up in a completely different culture, was exactly the same as you would find in the west. I always thought my mom is different. If I could find a woman like that I would marry her in a heart beat. But alas, after going red pill, I have realized how many flaws my mother has. Yes she is an absolutely fantastic cooking and cleaning machine, those are simply learned, step by step skills that I have also learned. 

Yes I live with my parents, and even pay rent. No one really asks what I do, where I go. This is helping me save for a proper place of my own. It used to be that my dad would punish me for half assed work, low effort, lack of attention to detail. He would always be mad at me when I couldn't figure something out on my own or handle a family matter when he isn't there at the time. This constant pressure has forced me to adapt. Making split second decisions, handling important matters that matter to he family as a whole is a non issue. Him and me work in tandem, hand in hand. Without my mother knowing he has changed the ownership of the house from Him to Him and Me. I have shed blood and sweat for the family (literally). There is a lot of responsibility handling this wealth that he has managed to accumulate, and I treat everything as my own and he treats everything as mine.

So where is the mom section you ask?

Well, my mom still see's me as her little boy, her son, her errand boy. My sister who is now 20, has completely westernized my mom. When I talk to my mom I realize, being a stay at home mom and having only my sister as a female friend for 90% of her married life, has kept her mind at the level of a 20 year old girl who doesn't have a care in the world about anything other than marriage, making babies and looking pretty. Yes she can handle her own in this life because as me and my sister were growing up, she stayed at home and handled things, but over time responsibilities shifted to me. Thanks to technology and mobile phone addiction (which I have uprooted from my life thanks to trp) her attention span is 0 and the amount of misinformation she consumes is enormous.

I have found myself frequently having to put my foot down on her and my sister, take matters into my own hands, but my mother who still does not understand I am a full grown red pilled man, that she should listen to me instead of argue and claim disrespect. I do not mean disrespect, it is her family and her household, but AWALT takes its toll. She can't use logic, she can't think on her feet, she lacks experience in using technology in a useful manner, she doesn't understand western culture outside of the 80's and 90's and how things have changed.

Due to the harsh times upon us thanks to COVID-19, my father and I have decided to up security measures around the property, stock up on various foods, grains, plant seeds, etc. Thing is, unlike my sister who is home from school, and my mother whose part time job let her go, my father and I are still working full time, and will not be sent home. Picking up supplies, doing online research, preparing for the worst is hard to do when you are already pretty busy. This is where the cracks show. Depending on delegation is no longer working and we had a huge fight between my dad and I, and the women in my house. I understand, men can handle a lot more than women, and can do more, period. But this has nothing to do with the topic. It all came down to my mom trying to throw me under the bus claiming I am irresponsible, that I should carry more of the load. I simply walked away, and let my father put her in her place. I was done arguing about it. I am not her errand boy, I am her future life line if anything is to happen to my father, and I will be the head of the family just as he was, and I answer for my actions in front of the family and the results will speak for themselves. She can doubt me, she can throw me under the bus, she can try to side track me from my goals, but it will have no effect as I only answer to other men.

TL;DR

At one point you grow out of being your moma's boy, her errand boy, her whatever boy. You answer to yourself, to other men even, but not her. She has done her job in feeding you and hopefully you had a father to raise you. I know you love her, but she will always keep you down.

Let’s take a look at a real life scenario that could happen to any one of us.

You are walking down the street one evening in your city's downtown area on the way to a date. Since you are in a time crunch you cut down an alleyway to save a few minutes. As you are walking you get an uneasy feeling in your gut. You can’t place it, but something feels off.

Moving past a dumpster you see movement out of your peripheral vision and before you can identify it, the words, “*Give me your wallet, phone and watch,*”  register in your ears. While instinctively turning towards the sound you feel a sharp pain in your side and when looking down see the knife blade being pulled from your gut. Falling to the ground you think to yourself, “How did this happen?”

Rule #1 says, “It’s your fault.”

---

*But I didn’t stab myself. I was just walking downtown. It’s a safe city. It was just bad luck.*

Sure, that is one way to look at it. Bad luck. But I don’t believe in luck. I believe we, through our intentional and unintentional actions, influence the world around us. We are the masters of our own destiny. By simply writing things off as bad luck or circumstance or **victim mentality** we are absolving ourselves of the **responsibility** to live our own lives.

In the above scenario are you an actual victim of a crime? Absolutely. Is the criminal to blame for your wounds? Of course. But who holds the responsibility for your life and the choices you made to put yourself there? Only you.

Did you have to be late and therefore choose to walk that way to save time? **No**. Could you have been more situationally aware and listen to your intuition? **Yes**. Even barring those was there a more advantageous outcome once engaged by the thief? **Of course**.

Let’s say you were Concealed Carrying (assuming it’s legal in your jurisdiction) and had enough situational awareness to notice the attacker before they were close enough to stab you. They still demand your money and with a knife in hand start to move towards you. You draw and shoot them.

Rule #1 It’s your fault.

(Disclaimer: This is a good scenario because it shows an important distinction between taking personal responsibility for your life, and legal or some other liability for your actions. I don’t ever want this rule to be construed as advice to take liability. It’s just about accepting the fact you are not a victim. It’s your fault. Own it personally, but in the above scenario shut up and ask for a lawyer.)

---

Why is it so important to take personal responsibility for your life?

If you spend your time trying to find and place blame, rather than just saying, “It’s my fault.” You will never be able to spend your time finding solutions and improving. If you write off the scenario above as bad luck, then you don’t learn how to avoid the situation to begin with.

When your girl cheats on you and you say, “It’s her fault for doing that.” You are technically correct and you should 1000% hold her responsible for her behaviour. But what did you do that led up to that. Things do not occur in a vacuum. Maybe you can evaluate the situation and come to the conclusion that you had no hand in anything leading up to it. But most likely not.

The other important reason for taking responsibility in your life is your own happiness.

When I get mad at people for things they do, I allow them to influence my happiness. If I look at every situation in life and ask, “How is this my fault?” I have much more control over outcomes and emotions about the situation. My happiness is no longer defined by others actions. I won’t be angry or upset about things that happen to me because I’m learning to own **my** life and **my** feelings.

Stop giving other people and life events power over your happiness and life. Take responsibility. Own your own life.

Over the years my syntax and diction has improved a lot. I’ve also developed a more seasoned arsenal of rebuttals that have led to some enjoyable banter with both men and women.

I honestly believe this all started when I was a teenager, back in the day when I inhaled more weed smoke than air. **My boys and I would freestyle all the damn time.** Even though we stopped smoking weed, we never stopped freestyling. I’m not talking “aspiring rapper” kind of freestyling, just get comfortable saying stupid shit, have fun, let loose. We did it alone, over beats or silence. Shit, I still do it in the shower. My employer doesn’t know, my plates don’t know, my family doesn’t know. 

I genuinely think freestyling gave me more “conversational confidence”. It gave me the ability to start saying something without knowing where it would lead to. Which is what you want when hitting on a girl, you want it to sound unrehearsed. 

It’s like drano for your thoughts, you get confident with how your voice sounds, you improve the pace of your word output and learn the rhythm that pairs best with your thought flow. I learned I’m better slow, with a sprinkle of speed here and there. 

It’s won’t be easy when you start. You will sound like an absolute idiot, but that’s part of the process, you got a bunch of idiotic shit to say before things sound better. Just stick to it, it’s a challenge, and if you can’t grow the balls to sound dumb around your boys, you’ll never have the balls to sound “witty” infront of a girl.

831,focmgh," 

This borrows some ideas from some recent posts, in my own original form and based on my own experiences. 

Female solipsism and narcissism. A concern only with how she is perceived socially. Her social appearance and the feelings which it provides are her driving force.

2 things...avoidance of blame and responsibility.

With bad behavior. Her default setting is that she is incapable of seeing the world through your eyes objectively. She is not interested in seeing her actions through your eyes. Or how it affects you.

She is only concerned with her social perception, and how that makes her feel.

She acts up. I could not say 'that was shitty, covert, secretive behavior'...and have her agree. 'yea, you're right'.

She is only concerned with protecting how she is perceived and how that makes her feel. How she can rationalize her own behavior away. Even if it contradicts reality.

She will say 'no, that isn't me' and 'don't make me feel bad'. 'I am not responsible'. The only thing that matters is what she sees through HER eyes. And her eyes will try to see her in the best light possible. Protect the feelz.

Secondly. In a greater sense, this leads to one of their ultimate operating programs.

They are driven by SOCIAL PERCEPTION. Over objective truth. If they can convince enough people they are a certain way, then it becomes the truth. 

Even if the truth of who they are, or their behavior is contrary. Social perception is more important than cold, hard, objective truths. 

They deal with people, not cold hard facts. If they can convince enough people they are a certain way, then it becomes truth. Even if it is incongruent with their actions. 

To many, social perception is so intoxicating, it can lead to a blinding lack of responsibility in their own lives. They will do anything, fuck whoever, behave however. But if in the minds of people she is seen as a 'good girl', it wipes out anything she does. That's all just 'feelz'. 'Enough people think I am good, so I am good'.

This is because many women, since girlhood, were taught that social perception is how they will survive. Boys were given things, taught skills, learned truths, to lead and taught that their ability to work and create is how they will survive. That is our value.

For women, it is how they are seen by others. Women were given make-up, beauty tips, told to be beautiful and ATTRACT THE GREATEST SUITOR. How they are perceived creates their truth and value.

They will gladly and unconsciously wipe out a history of incongruent behavior if they can convince enough people they are a 'good girl'. If others perceive it, and she feels it, it is 'true'.

How to tackle this, is firstly how you protect yourself. Listen to the stories and images she portrays. Know it doesn't necessarily signal objective and substantial truth. It's what she wants you to PERCEIVE. If she can convince you to perceive it and FEEL like she is that person, she is that person. Her measure of whether that is truly her is not on objective behavior, traits, and action. It is her ability to CONVINCE others to PERCEIVE her that way. It's up to you to decipher the distance from reality to desired perception. 

Watch what they do. Don't pedestalize. Watch for inconsistencies and lack of substantial objective truth to back up her stories. Words, images, and story without substantial proof is manipulation. Don't buy in right away. Especially if you don't see proof that what she says is what she is. 

Towards her. Always keep her on her toes. Always subtly hint that you don't buy into her bullshit. Amused Mastery. You're unaffected because you don't CARE what she is or does. But you're still the mighty authority, dropping hints that you see the holes. Tease her like a five-year-old girl who says 'this is who I aaamm', and believes how much she plays the part means she is the part. Cute, isn't it. She's a good little actress.

Always subtly play at her 'image'. If social perception is how she survives, you are the one who perceives who she really is. 'It's ok cutie, you can be the bad girl you really are with me, and I'll tell the world you're oh so good'.

You are a higher status, the authority. She needs your perception of her. If she can manipulate it, she's won. Drop hints that she can't. Tap and tease and pull at her frame. Not enough to show you care, but enough to show she's not winning or fooling the man of status and worth like the beta boys.

If social perception, image, and acceptance is her game, you play it better. You're not fooled, and you amusedly Remind her of that. You are the one she needs to convince the most of who she WANTS to feel like. You are the hardest to convince. 

And every time she talks the talk, with no sign of the walk, you gently remind her you really PERCEIVE her as a child",831,4.0,0.3458999991416931,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
832,fnn54p,"**It's probably my own fault for not being clear enough**, but it seems as though the prevailing misinterpretation of my last [post](http://archive.is/1nuYm) on understanding the FOUNDATION of ""masculinity is winning, and winning is power,"" is that getting women is the only marker for this, and this, getting women is the masculine mission. THIS IS NOT CORRECT.

**This reminds me of a story I told in the very first entry of my blog ([KTP](https://killtoparty.com/))**, where I was racking up female friends as an awkward, goofy fifteen-year-old and being such a good little *boy friend* (two words) that they'd pass their friend's phone numbers to me, in an age before AIM even (if you're too young to know what AIM is, think: texting with computers)- and I thought I was on my way to getting a *girlfriend* (one word). I'd spend hours upon hours on the phone with them (thinking MORE me is BETTER me and more EFFECTIVE me), making chitchat, and gossiping, and... well, whatever they'd want to talk about (to use the lingo, not just falling into, but *existing soley* in their frame).

Until one day, my father sat me down and told me that none of these girls were ever going to be my girlfriend.. and I was shocked, and angry, and *embarrassed*, and I'm sure I reacted like an ungrateful asshole but... I knew he was right.

**The mistake most teenagers make: I made getting girls the mission**, and then I'd be confused when they'd date boys who gave them less attention, and instead worked on their cars, and had cool jobs, and played sports, and had bands... had missions outside of spending all their time being a *boy friend* (yup, two words).

**Women cannot be the masculine mission**. Yes, it is totally valid to be a GENUINE voluntary celibate, the key word being GENUINE- and only you can be honest with yourself if you choose this path. But understand that you've then taken yourself out of the game, so of course women cannot be a marker of success...

But, if the game is what you're playing, it's naive to say that attracting women isn't a marker of success. Think of it like a litmus test- **WOMEN ARE A MARKER OF SUCCESS FOR A MAN.** It doesn't have to be your end goal, or your purpose in life (and, let's be real, unless you want a family, women are just a fancier means of masturbation). But, just like waking up with a roaring hard-on is an informal, but still darn good, marker for masculine health and wellness, GETTING WOMEN IS A MARKER FOR SUCCESS- a symptom, a gauge, a little bit of real-world feedback.

Remember, women are naturally attracted to the most genuinely, overall successful (physically attractive, socially adept, interesting, mysterious, etc. etc.)- they may fake attraction to a *overall* unsuccessful man with resource- but, again, **if you wanted a real-world, real-time gauge on your success, the number of women you can attract is a good marker for this.**

...and to answer the question in the subject field.. if there were no women left on Earth, success and power would be defined by whomever is winning (biggest castle? most weapons? who the fuck knows...).",832,4.0,0.4675000011920929,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

My fellow Men -

By nature we negotiate. We negotiate business deals, car purchases, home purchases, cellphone plans, if there is an angle for negotiation, we naturally jump on the opportunity to bargain. When the goal is simple, and the payouts low, most here will resort to base tactics, attempting to emotionally justify, that 'everyone wins'. I used to sell cars, it was confusing when customers happily agreed to the midpoint of our price difference as we salesman knew we'd be working from the midpoint down. 

Negotiations, in general, are about reconciling differences in a thoughtful, intelligent manner. Usually a checklist of must haves, ok having, and not ok having. We work with fellow Men and their lawyers & try to predict future issues, often setting up clear guidelines in how to deal with them in advance. If you've ever seen a purchase & sale agreement of a business, or even boilerplate home sales, behind the scenes were series of Negotiations.

So when your plate, FWB, LTR, Wife, comes to you with issues, whether logical or completely emotional, the **fool** responds by turning on his natural base negotiation tactics. 

Do I look pretty in this yellow dress? *Responds honestly*

You should cuss less. *Goes into scientific mode & responds how cussing is a sign of trust*

**Can we take a break?** *Why? Did I do something wrong? I'll be better, I promise. I'll try.*

My fellow Men -

You cannot negotiate feelings. You can only manipulate them. Don't resort to Man-speak, where words & facts are your sword and shield - useless, in the presence of the Feminine. Target & work with the underlying feelings. No negotiation

834,fmi710,"I found TRP 5 years ago while Google-searching “How to get out of the friendzone”. Thankfully, one of the Google search results led me to TRP where I read post after post after post; alongside articles from Rollo Tomassi’s *The Rationale Male.*


During my first four months of finding TRP I literally read TRP all day long, day after day. I read through TRP posts as if I was studying for an examination. I particularly enjoyed the comments section, they were pure gold those day. You got even more revelation from the comments than from the main posts.  I read TRP so much that my eyes began to hurt – literally and figuratively (“Why do my eyes hurt?” – Neo).


However there was one theme I kept reading over and over, yet couldn’t internalize: **How to Stop Giving a Fuck.** I won’t forget that day I clicked on a Sidebar Article which had been posted a few months before I found TRP – **One Key Step to Not Giving a Fuck** (Originally, **The Guide to Accepting Yourself Even When Women Don’t**). The poster deleted his account shortly afterwards. May the soul of his account rest in perfect peace.


That post changed my life forever. I later realized that learning to accept myself and not to give a fuck about many things is key to developing many other traits such as Frame, Abundance, etc. The post is on the sidebar, but throughout my 5 years on TRP, I have never seen anyone refer to it either in a post or a comment; hence this post. I’ll paste the original post here:


> Recently someone here posted about how women define ""average"" in astronomical terms, based on some bullshit a girl said while shit testing him. Most of the responses didn't understand that he was being tested because most of the commenters aren't ok with themselves at all.


> **Quick Method**


> Know all those dating apps and sites you use? Know how you like to finely craft introductions designed to make the woman see you in a favorable light?


> Don't do that.


>Send any one of these messages that say, ""I love me and I don't care if you do.""


> 1 - ""Boners.""


> 2 - ""Super boners.""


> 3 - ""I'm going to be playing video games all week but you can come over this weekend and do my laundry.""


> 4 - ""Do you ever get those crusties in your asshole and pick them out in the shower?""


> 5 - ""Want to help me practice for my driver's exam? The police said I can finally get my license.""

> These messages are not meant to get you a woman. The responses you receive (you will get responses) will show you how much better this type of ""who really fucking cares right?"" attitude matches up against, ""Oh god oh god oh god I'd better say the right thing.""


> And that leads us to today's lesson:


> **You don't matter that much.**


>Sorry, but if the fate of the world rested on your shoulders we'd all be fucked. You're reading how-to guides about becoming ok with yourself. So really you don't matter that fucking much.


>And that's fine! That's preferable. It takes pressure off your shoulders. You can walk into a bar and tell a girl that you're a martian whose pants will explode at midnight unless an earth girl removes them with her teeth. Guess what? No one will care! Tomorrow CNN will run a headline about ISIS feeding babies to elephants and your pickup line will become just another blip in the endless history of the universe.


> Corollary - Women will try to make you think that you **should matter a whole lot.** They'll tease you and ask you why you're not a buff macho kingpin or why you don't own 10 businesses and a thousand dogs. The important thing to notice here is:
*That's what they say, not what they think.*


>Most women wouldn't give ten shits about your income or dog breeding knowledge if you are ok enough with yourself to show them a good time. Confidence does not come to you by knowing that you're big stuff and that you're a huge valuable part of society. If it did, hardly anyone would be confident because hardly anyone actually matters that much.


>Confidence comes with knowing that you don't matter that much and that other people really don't either, women included. So if it's not that big of a deal, what do you have to lose?


>Nothing.

> **Little people often have big pride.**


>It helps them not feel little. It's a defense mechanism. Being defensive is itself a small and impotent thing to do.


>Pride weighs a lot. It's one of the biggest forms of baggage and some of you have been feeling it in your chest for years without realizing it. It comes in the form of thoughts like, ""What am I going to be doing a year from now? Two years from now? If all my dreams aren't coming true, I'm a worthless piece of shit.""


> Or, ""I need the perfect body, most money, and biggest adventures or I'll be a drain on humanity, just another turd in the bucket.""


> Or, ""If I don't bang every hot chick and turn into a fuck stud of epic proportions, I'm just another waste of space.""


> Guess what?


> People who don't care if they get ass...get more ass than you.


>People with shitty bodies who don't give a fuck...get more ass than you.


>People who have zero ambition and are ok with that...get more ass than you.


> **If it is truly your ambition in life to become something great, then you will follow that ambition no matter what.** You won't dither about it. You won't get confused and wonder if you're doing the right thing. You definitely won't beat yourself up about not doing it.


> So if you're an ambitionless ham planet and you absolutely love your life, there's no reason to qualify yourself to women ever.
If you're a healthy cut millionaire and you hate your life, well I can't help you with that. .0001% problems.


> So make a list of the shit you love about yourself that women would call ""immature"" or ""irresponsible"" and then realize that shit is all in your head. Almost anything you do (short of rape and murder) can be awesome and praiseworthy if you love doing it and you're solid about that to the core.


> Women will prod at you all day and shit test, saying, ""Well a mature real man is like this,"" or, ""I can only be with a man who blah blah blah."" If you aren't ok with yourself, you'll cave to this type of bullshit instantly. If you're fully ok with yourself, you'll laugh it off and continue on being you.


> **Remember this:**


> There are no rules for life other than eat, sleep, breathe, and survive. The rest is completely made up. Clothes? Optional. Words? Optional. Bathing? Optional. Dating? Made up. Relationship standards? Fiction. Breeding? Unnecessary.


> You could wake up tomorrow and pretend you're an African prince who has to drive backwards to work or else the mafia will come and steal your asshole. And that would make only marginally less sense than people driving to the same workplace every day to get money to pay for a piece of the planet they were born on which can be taken away by a group of people in a big building with giant metal rooms full of green paper.


> So you don't matter that much and life is ridiculous. You couldn't possibly make life any more ridiculous than it already is. So don't go around acting like every little action matters.


> Accept yourself.

835,fmhzor,"**It was a few months ago when a big, burly man with a beard- whom, I believe runs a lifting podcast- had a viral video shouting about masculinity.** In response to the [bugman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cetg4gu0oQQ)/[corporate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koPmuEyP3a0) alliance to redefine masculinity as weakness and submission- masculinity, as he put it, cannot be redefined and is only what it has been in the traditional sense: brute strength, the ability to confront and defend, and a willingness to fight to the death- if necessary. And while he isn't *necessarily wrong*, he isn't telling the full story... so let's start at the very beginning: 

**Masculinity is power**

He's right that the most visceral and immediately obvious form of power is in physical force and muscular aesthetic. Walk into a room and get heads to turn, often getting silently assigned the leadership position in any group you're part of (AMOG) based solely on appearances- because, yes, we judge books by their covers because this is *far more often than not* totally correct. The world can be highly predictable through genetics and physiognomy.

But what are men to do who are under six feet tall, and have less than admirable physical appearances (yes, I hear you yelling ""LIFT,"" let's put that aside temporarily)- men who are less than the obvious genetic alpha male, who aren't going to admit sexual market place defeat, will need to find a different route to power... so, now let's expand our definition of masculinity to include these men who have found alternate routes to power:

**Masculinity is winning, and winning is power**

Thinking back to the very foundation of the red pill- the evolutionary foundation of the red pill- men are programmed to want to impregnate (fuck) as many women as they can. This will calm the nerves of your pre-programmed, biological anxiety (sex drive)- this is why we discourage too much jacking off and certainly no porn, which serve as an artificial means of quelling this anxiety; we WANT you to be anxious, and use that anxiety to drive you to success (fucking as many women as you'd like).

So, in wanting to fuck *all the women*, men must compete with one another- and if we define success as *fucking as many women as one would like*, which is inarguable POWER (not money- no one wants to be a dickless billionaire), **masculinity must be defined as winning this game by any means necessary.**

Back to those bugmen who make YouTube videos attempting to redefine masculinity- it may not be admirable, but they're only trying (ok, and failing) to win the game the only way they can.

How about this: is the I DON'T GIVE A FUCK drug dealer masculine, even if he's 120 pounds and addicted to heroin? If he's winning and getting pussy, why not?

Now, of course, your life shouldn't be bought and sold on getting pussy alone- even if the drug dealer is winning temporarily, this isn't sustainable as the kind of healthy habits the burly man was yelling about, but to say this kind of *live for today,* carpe diem philosophy isn't masculine because it doesn't include raw power and muscle isn't quite the case either- it's just not terribly smart.

When we consider the behavior of the WHITE KNIGHT, we see him as unconsciously realizing that he cannot compete (and win) against men who are naturally good with women, he attempts to win by disqualification by displaying to the woman that, while he may not be the cool guy or the hot guy, his advantage is being *the respectful guy.* Of course, we're too smart to think this (ever) works- but again, the idea is to redefine the masculine as respect in order to win the game and grasp power.

When we think about GAME- what game is and why it's effective- we can conclude that game is signaling social attributes that *disqualify the competition*. For example, if other men shower you with praise and complements, I will tease you to demonstrate that I am *not impressed by your beauty and facade*- I've been with girls who are prettier, and therefore are pre-selected and of higher-value than those other non-masculine men. **A win by disqualification is still a win if the end product is the same.**  

**Winning the competition is masculinity and losing the competition is not.** Now get out there and FUCKING WIN.

836,flm3xk,"**It always gets me when semi-manosphere bloggers half-kiddingly will say that game is dead**- because more men are game aware, and competition is fierce. This has everything to do with the promiscuity market fully over-taking the relationship market, as fewer women feel a pressing need to have a relationship and are more open to long periods of being single and ""dating"" (commonly refered to as ""hook-up culture"").

In short, **game isnt dead** but anything less than top-shelf game is a waste of time. No longer do you have a lifebar, this is *one hit kill* territory. Think of it like this, just being a guy concerned with fitness twenty years ago would be a gold star in your favor- now it's a pre-requisite for entry (and don't expect to actually impress a woman with your physique unless you're in the legit top 10% of your gym).

So let's start with the very basics, **what is game and why does it work?**

First, a quick reminder of biology- from an evolutionary, human-as-animal perspective: men want to impregnate (fuck) as many women as possible and women only want to get impregnated (fucked) by the highest quality of mate. This is why you could see a girl on the side of the road with big tits in a tight tank top and know, for certain, that you'd fuck her in the three seconds you glance at her in passing... a woman will make that same snap judgment (gut-instinct, or ""female intuition""), but for the opposite purpose- as a means of sifting through and disqualifying potential mates efficiently.

**Game is a means of hacking her unconscious disqualification system**- *unconscious* because she knows what excites her (Chad) and what she's disgusted by (bottom 80% of men); this is something that happens in her brain, at all times, like software running in the background. Proper use of game is meant to make her take pause and *consciously* doubt the accuracy of this system.

For example, if she initially perceives you as a beta, and assumes you have stereotypical beta qualities: humble, nice, desperate for validation and attention, uncool social skills, shy, insecure, impressed by her beauty- when you display the polar opposite of these attributes, in a manner that is bold and captivating, she will *temporarily* reassess her unconscious appraisal.

**Negging, or teasing a woman, is the most common and timeless methods of game and should be in anyone repertoire.** When you tease a woman, you're extinguishing several of the aforementioned beta traits in combination, depending on the particular neg: you aren't very impressed by her (implying that you are used to her degree of beauty), youi do have cool social skills, you're confident and outcome independent- if she's not cool enough to get the joke, she could take a walk. You're the opposite of every guy falling all over her, you have good genetics, and are worth mating with.

Of course game only works temporarily- after all, this is a hack. It must be continued indefinitely, even if only intermittently (in LTR), in order for her unconscious to not override her doubts- in which case, she'll begin to lose attraction and interest in you until the relationship is completely over. This is very likely the end of every relationship you've had.

**Do all men need game?** Yes and no. All men can certainly use game, but the true necessity of game depends on the value discrepancy between man and woman. If a male 09 is interested in a female 06, he likely have a pass to behave however he wants- if he wants to date a female 08, he'll need game.

837,fl7jab,"A neverending dilemma that most in the BP world deal with is the sudden and unexplained shift in the women they marry. What happened to that angelic woman who wanted sex five times a day and treated you like a king? Well, for starters, she never existed. Instead, more likely, she did the bare minimum that the beta she was plying her wares on magnified in his mind because he has such a limited experience of what women are willing to do with, to and for a man they invested in. Secondly, and more critically, is the paradox of commitment: she despises the man for giving it to her.

It makes no sense on the surface. A man committing his time, energy, resources to one woman for the rest of his life is something that is celebrated and encouraged of all of us from the time we're old enough to be indoctrinated. Surely every woman's dream is to have the man she loves do this for her, correct? Why, then, would she despise the chump who saves up for six months, buys a nice shiny rock, gets on one knee and proceeds to spend a small fortune on one day? If you know female nature, especially the hyper nature it has taken over the past 60 years, then you likely know the answer.

See, the woman in this scenario, and every other woman in existence, knows an immutable truth. This truth is that the man is not committing to who he thinks he's marrying. Instead, he's marrying an idealised version presented to him by careful charms and illusions and cemented by his own pre-programmed beliefs. The real her is a dirty little slag who wants to sleep with as many hot guys as possible and extract commitment from one of *them*. The real her wants to have consequence-free sex and hop from one guy to the next until she finds the best amongst them she can extract marriage from. The real her doesn't want to be tied down to any particular alpha, but to sample as many as time will allow before deciding who will marry her. The only problem? Well, she can certainly get these guys to sleep with her, but very few are willing to stick around. And thus, her dual drives must compete and find a victor, and because she has a limited window where she is viable to the largest portion of men, she must eventually accept that the beta is the best she can do. Except, she doesn't. Not really.

See, women cannot reconcile a direct causality between the choices they made in their younger years with where they are romantically. She can't admit that her blatant whoring led to unrealistic valuations of her own place in the SMP, or that the distinct lack of viable, steady LTRs left her crippled and unable to maintain relationships through the inevitable lulls. Instead, she blames the man. If he wasn't such a chump, she'd undoubtdly be happier. And this is true, to the extent that betas are awful mates who can't provide the rocksteady foundations that women need, nor the firm hand they desire. But even beyond this, she wouldn't be happy because the problem goes much deeper than the chump she's with. The core is that she knows that she is not worthy of commitment.

You know that old joke about not wanting to be a member of any club that would have you? Women operate in that way. Because she knows herself and her several inadequacies, she can't help but look down on the fool who actually commits himself to her. She knows she's not worthy of commitment by any self-respecting man. She built up a facade that anyone with keen eyes can see through, and the fact that the man who commits to her cannot see through this glamour inevitably leads to her labeling him as unworthy. Because any man who can't see though her is worthless, because what experienced prospector mistakes copper for gold?",837,4.0,0.40880000591278076,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
838,fkxz2z,"#Introduction 

This virus shit is getting out of hand. Many of you are going to use this time to get weak as fuck and rationalize breaking your discipline. Don't. Stay strong and heed my advice. Although I wrote this as a chapter for my book, I figured I'd share it with the community that inspired me to get my shit together in the first place. 

Godspeed.





#1 Get Rid of Your Victim Mentality.


I have seen people with one leg running marathons using a prosthetic leg. 

I have seen people with no arms in the gym doing leg presses. 

I have seen people with stumps for legs (seated) overhead pressing 225 like it’s nothing. 


Even if you can’t move physically (at all) you can get strong mentally. Go read. Stephen Hawking couldn’t bench 225 but he could solve the puzzles of the fucking universe. Hell, even Helen Keller made use of herself and couldn't see or hear.
 
**The only excuses you have for weakness and mediocrity are rationalizations that are full of shit and have no ground in reality if you have an ounce of will.**

Practically everybody that’s lacking strength is rationalizing their weakness through a shit ton of means instead of looking in the mirror and seeing themselves for what they are; complacent spineless cowards who need to get their lives together.  

“Oh, I can’t lose weight… I’m naturally fat.” 

“Oh, I can’t gain weight… I’m naturally skinny…” 

“The universe hates me.” 

“I just have bad luck.” 

“Mercury is in retrograde.” 

All of this smells like bitch to me. It’s amazing how far people will go to justify being mediocre. The purpose of this post is to talk a little bit about rationalizations and the nature of weakness so you can get your shit together and become the greatest possible version of yourself.

#2 Understand Why We Rationalizatize.


Rationalizations are born out of a need to justify bad decisions and/or weakness.

Got drunk after you said you’d quit drinking again? 

*“Oh well, I had a rough week. I needed SOMETHING.”*

Went back to your shitty ex-girlfriend because you were horny? 

*“I had to get this nut off somehow. She isn’t so bad…”*

Cheating on your diet? 

*“It’s just ONE donut… and besides, I earned it.”* 

You get the point. Rationalizations “justify” bad decisions, lack of dedication, and weakness of will.

The next question is how exactly do we spot rationalizations and nip them in the bud before they end up manifesting itself as a weakness? 

There are two types of rationalizations. 

* Before the act.

* After the act.


#3 Don't fall for Before the Act Rationalizations.


Before the act rationalizations are really simple. When you’re about to do something you know you shouldn’t do you begin thinking of reasons why you should.

“I worked hard on my last gym session… I can miss one, it won’t hurt.” 

“I’m feeling really lonely… maybe she’s changed.”

“I don’t need to do *x* today, I can just do it tomorrow and I’ll be fine. Besides, I deserve a break.”

I needn’t go on. 

This just takes will and self-control. Notice the rationalization and don’t fall for it. There’s no special trick; just don’t fall for it and stay focused on your goal.

#4 How to Stop After the Act Rationalizations.


Rationalizations after the fact are dangerous. They justify being a failure and acting all high and mighty when you really ain’t shit. You already fucked up. The only thing you can do now is get back on the horse but know it’s going to be harder than when you first started. When you do something wrong and rationalize it afterward instead of berating and punishing yourself as you should be, you’re telling yourself it’s okay to fail and be an inferior human being. 

It’s not okay to fail. Anybody who tells you otherwise is a loser themselves. When you fail you should get angry, you should be pissed, whoever is graceful in defeat is destined for defeat.

It’s not okay to be an inferior human being. This is self-explanatory. If it isn't, get out of the gene pool.

The only way to stop these kinds of rationalizations is to stop failing. Just stop. Is it gonna be easy? No. Is it going to be worth it? Do it and find out for yourself.

#5 Understand Weakness.


**Weakness is a lack of something that’s needed to achieve a goal.**

Want to squat 600 pounds but can’t? You lack leg strength. 

Want to approach that chick but can’t? You lack social strength. 

Cracking under pressure when you want to be calm and composed? You lack mental strength.

**Everything wrong with you is due to a weakness of some kind. Even if you were dealt a shitty hand by the game of life you'd better play the fuck out of that hand. Make the most of it.**

Pinpoint your weaknesses through honest self-evaluation then fix them accordingly. The keyword is “honest.” Self-evaluation can quickly turn into self-delusion if you feed your ego. I’d rather be too hard on myself than too easy on myself; the former can still make you grow, the latter helps you stagnate and plateau.  

#6 Focus on stopping one and you'll stop the other.


The connection between rationalization and weakness cannot be overstated. You’re weak because you rationalize and you rationalize because you’re weak. 

When you focus on stopping one or the other, you’ll notice that over time you stopped rationalizing AND being weak, assuming you’re putting in the work to actually grow.

Of course, there are those who stop rationalizing and are okay with weakness regardless. These people are hopeless. Don't worry about them. Chances are if you're browsing the subreddit you're probably not one of these people.

There will be a lot of yelling and CAPS in this post. Do NOT read if you're sensitive and get offended easily..

The ""How to get laid"" mentality sets one up for a very precarious attitude and a deletrious one at that. \~It goes against the very core of TRP which is based on indifference, stoicism, realization and acceptance of reality, starting to put yourself on a pedestal, developing yourself because of selfish internal reasons (not external outcomes A.K.A. getting laid) . 

&#x200B;

Your propellers **MUST NEVER BE** ""WE ARE HERE TO GET LAID. HERE ARE SOME POINTS FOLLOW THIS SHIT FOR A YEAR TO GET SOME PUSSY ACTION...... MAY BE.""  


TRP is more about changing internal attitude than getting results. Getting results (or laid) is a by-product of reprogramming yourself (which WILL happen and you won't even care that it did) and hence living a longer, wiser (better frame) and more fulfilling life. But the very first prerequisite for getting laid is to be indifferent toward the thoughts of getting laid. It all starts in the mind, with the awareness of your own thoughts, discovering your own motivations and character. Awareness and recognition of underlying unwholesome mental motivations(AKA lustful thoughts which make you bring your ass to the gym/workplace) is the prerequisite to transformation.

IF YOU CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT GETTING LAID AND EVERY ACTION YOU DO IS TO GET SOME ACTION IN A YEAR OR SO, YOU WILL NEVER GET LAID, STAY UNHAPPY, IGNORANT AND OUTCOME DEPENDENT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

&#x200B;

Imagine Michael Jai White or Jason Statham saying on TV that they started fighting because they wanted some pussy back in the day. How fuckin shallow is that?   


The only such celebrity with the ""how to get laid mentality"" that comes to my mind right now was Mystery. He did get a lot of pussy in his pursuit but did he get freedom from external circumstances (true outcome independence?). We all know how that ended.

  


1. Your actions of self-improvement should come from a mindset of competitiveness/ambitiousness/selfishness NOT 'to get laid'.  
In other words : Your investment(via actions/thoughts/time devoted) in yourself should not be driven by 'Oh yeah! I'm gonna get laid in a year, i just need to stick to this regime' 
2. I'd rather have this line of thought (which isn't perfect btw) but much better: 'I'm gonna eat better because I wanna fuckin win that boxing tournament beat the crap out of \*insert Chad's name here\* or I wanna be able to do at least 1 muscle up in the next 10 days'. 
3. Get some competitive, toxic, masculine SOBs AKA Chads in your friend circle. You don't realize how much you need that toxicity(or rather positivity) in your life, they slap you with truth bombs in your face without thinking twice. They are like walking talking TRPers who hold you accountable for your laziness.
4. But The thing is: No Chad would wanna befriend your sensititve, outcome dependent ass, unless you are already improving or a threat to them or intimidating in some way (physically or psychologically).  
5. Easiest way to form an acquaintance with a Chad is to challenge them. Criticize their life style choices, shit test them (do not do this publicly if you're a sensitive bitch). Form a fuckin rivalry. Sounds pretty dang uncomfortable, right? Good. I'd take Rivals any day over 'friends'.
6. Rivalries have the most positive affect on your life. Keeps your bones greased and mind focused. How many people are jealous of you or would trade places with you right the fuck now? Any gym buddies? co-workers? Someone considers you a rival only when they respect you. Respect is gained only when you have something of value which others don't. You have something of value only when you put yourself in discomfort consistently, persistently and critically analyze your 'skill'.
7. Friendships are mostly 'insurance policies during a calamity' or 'jealousy in disguise' or \*insert any kind of selfish value sucking agenda\*. May be you have a compassionate totally selfless friend who you can count on and may be I'm wrong here. Still its best to be cynical here and have other back up plans when shit hits the fan rather than depending on this 'selfless friend'. Assume worst case scenario and have a plan B if Billy's wife doesn't want you to crash at their home anymore..
8. Got the crap beaten out of you by a Chad during a friendly spar? Good, now you are motivated as fuck, a hurt ego is the bestest of friends, you won't care about chasing skirts anymore, at least for a while. Getting physically dominated is the fastest way to get motivated and for a long time. Feeling physically inferior and inadequate compared to another male is one of the most basic emotions and quintessential to survival.
9. Have a friend circle you spar regularly with. Approach anxiety is nothing compared to a 6'8"" Behemoth of a fighter looking to tackle you with a shit-eating grin when the match is about to start. If you get used to the feeling of flight or fright you won't give a shit when you're rejected because the Will to survive is always more than will to copulate.
10. our motivations is our character and as BPilled as we are, we gotta rebuild our character and the thoughts that push us to improve.
11. The best way to improve is to measure your every GOOD AND BAD habit. Measuring puts a sense of achievement with every milestone. For example: Write down the amount of weights/reps you do for each exercise in an excel file. Every month, go in for a full body composition analysis (lean and fat both) and observe the graph of how you improve your lifting capabilities. I highly recommend it. It keeps you working towards your goal like a train on rails. Drink a lot of beer every day? Have a calendar and mark beer free days every month.
12. ALWAYS FUCKIN ASSUME YOU ARE BLUE PILLED BETA. I don't care if you're Orlando Bloom or Brad Pitt. Assume that you are not a pro, assume that you don't know shit yet, assume you are foolish. The day you stop caring about Alphas and Betas and fuckin Gammas and Deltas is the day you won't be one. The day you are not controlled by this terminology or your desire to stick your dick inside a wet hole is the day you will be truly security within yourself which leads to outcome independence. If someone calling you an incel brings out even a speck of retaliating thought inside you, know that you still measure yourself by how much you get laid and you get affected by other's opinion of you. Many will disagree with me here. Keep the downvotes coming.....
13. A newbie who knows he is bad with women and his life is a mess is already miles ahead of a foolish TRPer who just reads one book and faps and thinks he knows it all and is outcome independent now. 

&#x200B;

Example: You should eat better because you ignore your 'dopamine craving' train of thoughts (lizard mind) under control and you want to be stronger than you currently are and live longer. Your purpose should not be another dopamine fix. Be wiser (Wise = thinking about long term benefit at the cost of instant pleasure). 

**In five years from now The variety of instantly gratifying foods you're consuming will shrink to a half of what you're able to consume today. Would you rather slow your junk food consumption down or stop out of necessity. That day will come really soon when you won't be able to keep beer down in your tummy like you were able to when you were 18. CUT DOWN CONSUMPTION OF DOPAMINE SPIKING FOODS, Slow it down, eat responsibly and be very alert of what you put inside your mouth.**

&#x200B;

Lifting does help alleviate this and you can eat more than you chew every once in a while but not like when you were 18 and went clubbing till 5AM consumed shit ton of alcohol then went out to eat ham burgers at mcdonalds, then smoked some weed.

&#x200B;

Try doing that when you're in your 30s, your body will say a big **""FUCK YOU"" and reject all that shit.**  


It is better to eat the shit you love sporadically and have the option for doing so for a longer time than to be forced to give up eating stuff you love due to health reasons.

&#x200B;

When we sacrifice one 'dopamine-seeking behaviour' (instantly gratifying food) for another 'dopamine seeking behaviour' (sexual gratification), our mindset tends to stay the same. We Stay outcome dependent. Bottom line still remains the same : We crave dopamine.  


  
Give that up shit from the bottom of your heart..FUCKIN TELL YOURSELF YOU WON'T DRINK ALCOHOL FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. BE VIGILANT WHEN YOUR LIZARD BRAIN TELLS YOU TO FAP/EAT SHIT. TELL YOUR LIZARD BRAIN, YOU WILL EAT BROCCOLI EVERYDAY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. When you come home from a good butt kicking workout, you thank yourself (your wiser, intellectual mind) and feel fuckin awesome. Thats the same feeling you get The day you actually turn down drinking beer and give up bad habits, It truly feels liberating.   


The problem with setting boundaries is that you need to fuckin set boundaries for yourself first that you yourself have to obey. SAY NO TO YOUR DOPAMINE CRAVING MIND FOR ONCE before saying it to others. Do 10 push ups RIGHT FUCKIN NOW. Do it you pussy.....It is for you and the nurturing of your wiser 'intellectual part' of your mind.

&#x200B;

  


FRAME : You wanna know how to maintain frame? First you need to build a strong frame. Before that you need to define what is frame to you?  


Frame: What plan of action you have convinced yourself internally to follow for 'the rest of you life'. Rest of the opinions/views is all but gibberish. Being a man of action requires a plan of action and Not getting distracted over trivial shit (like feminism) Read about it, don't openly subscribe to any agenda. It will only blow up in your face. Forming an identity only brings madness and suffering your way. Be anonymous, keep a low profile (if your line of work allows it), keeps stuff mysterious and people curious. 

  
""**For the rest of my life""** is the key phrase here.  


A frame that is based on wisdom, longevity of life, building strength, skill and improvement.

That only comes when you are consistent, persistent and consciously manage your habits (everyone needs indulgence every once in a while but not overdoing it needs conscious effort)

Consistency comes with controlling your lizard mind (primitive brain). So either you control your own mind and form a good work ethic or someone else will employ you and control you. Its your choice.

&#x200B;

You will have a weaker frame if it is not long term, visionary and helps you in survival. 

&#x200B;

LIFTING: This is where it starts: The prerequisite to transformation:

For example: TRP has a frame: The Sidebar. The first thing it does is to prompt you to 

go and start LIFTING. It's the first step to self improvement.  


Does anyone disagree with that? Can anyone outframe TRP on that matter? HELL NO. 

BECAUSE TRP IS FOCUSED ON PUTTING YOU IN THE UPPER ECHELON OF HUMANITY (ARE YOU?), LONGEVITY OF YOUR LIFE and YOUR SURVIVAL AMONGST THE FITTEST.

Everyone has frame. It comes from a variety of variables : A set of preprogrammed instructions, a plan of action, a core philosophy a group of people subscribe to.

For example: One of my former acquaintances used to drink a lot every day. He asked me almost everyday to join him. I just started going to the gym and was consciously managing my thoughts, habits and friend circle. He recently called me and asked for my help. Now I like to help people, it is in my nature (I know its blue pilled as fuck). I recognized that part of me and set up some screening for the victim and some boundaries for myself (out of respect for my time), so that I don't feel guilty.  


I told him to go to the gym for at least 2 months first, get a personal trainer, then I will think about training together. To be honest, even if he went to the gym for a month I would have helped him but he wasn't committed enough (neither financially nor mentally), so there was no reason for me to care.

This was a shit test I wanted to make him jump hoops to test his commitment level because i don't wanna commit any more than he is committed to himself.

  
Same goes for any chick friends that I have.

&#x200B;

Enrolling at a gym was the best financial decision I ever made in my life. The returns are IMMEASURABLE as compared to the fee.

BUT, Lifting is only the prerequisite. Once you are at a point where the reward to risk ratios to lifting are really low compared to the amount of time and effort you're putting in, I'd say maintain your physique in the gym (around 10-15% bodyfat), stop increasing weights and GO JOIN A BJJ/BOXING GYM. You know why? 

After a point of time Lifting more weights starts working against you. It decreases your flexibility, agility and attractiveness. 

&#x200B;

Girls would rather fuck Jason Statham than a bodybuilder with a bubble gut.  


&#x200B;

And it does wonders for inner game. You become an elite inside your head. 

&#x200B;

A fighter has more odds of kicking a bodybuilder's ass than another bodybuilder. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now imagine actually being a guy who has Chads as acquaintances, is 15% bodyfat, knows Jiu-Jitsu/Boxing (at least the basics) or is good at calisthenics, is motivated by long term goals, does not drink alcohol. Imagine it for a second. Picture it in your mind.  


Vs   


A guy who is waking up every day motivated by the possibility of having sex in may be a year or two?

&#x200B;

 Who is more likely to give up? 

&#x200B;

Who is more likely to fall under depression?

&#x200B;

When you no longer require sex to have fun and maintain your psychological health is when you get to have sex.

Thats the paradox.  


The aim must be to become a guy who doesn't 'NEED' sex to be happy and is non-chalant about it. One has fun in other ways. Don't go around wasting time doing useless shit like riding a motorbike unless you're Marc Marquez(I know i did). If you commit to a hobby, do it everyday, become good at it. Make sure you are at least one of the top 3 guys around your area. It will take investment and effort and consistency. A time will come when you will get your dopamine fix out of these hobbies and then some. People will start recognizing you. Hell, you may even be able to earn money with your hobby and a day will come when you will need your employer less than he needs you because you will have other sources of income.

&#x200B;

When you will compete for psychological and physical dominance, you will learn clever comebacks UNCONSCIOUSLY when you get outwitted by Chads. It is fun outframing like minded people and outwitting them.

&#x200B;

Not sure if TRP addresses what im about to say but:  


A major part of staying happy is to be grateful for every single thing we take for granted and reduce unnecessary possessions. 

But don't be vocal about it, do not mention it to any one individual about how fuckin thankful you are if someone does shit for you. 

When you start being grateful for that piece of shit '04 honda Civic you own, you stop fuckin buying drive thru food and keep its interior clean. You sure as hell don't let any plate make a mess of your car even if she is an LTR unless they're cleaning it. (You sir are now setting boundaries)

&#x200B;

Humility keeps you grounded and happy and treasure the things you have in life.

840,fknwhe,"TL;DR – if you subconsciously chase security, you will always remain in mediocrity. Why obsessing over being accepted and labeling ourselves often results in stopping at the bare minimum and lacking motivation to approach women, improve, and grow. Why women typically have more controlling behaviours, and ***why they find mediocrity unattractive.***

I want to talk a bit about the problems of seeing success as binary, and having a safety-obsessed mindset, and how that holds men back.

Binary thinking goes something like this: “I either succeed, or I fail”; “I’m either perfect, or I’m a failure”; “I’m either alpha, or I’m beta”; “I am either accepted, or rejected”. There is no in-between in this frame. This mindset is one of the main reasons why so many guys are terrified to do approaches. Defining yourself as one of two states in a binary spectrum is an indication of a security-obsessed mindset.

# The Security Obsession

Growth and improvement is not about “being something”. ***The only people obsessed with “being something”, are those who believe that the label will give them safety.*** Being alpha is not a label you are awarded that somehow grants you unconditional security. In fact, obsessing over the alpha label is typical beta behaviour. Alpha is an attitude, where you have freed yourself from external influences that might cause anxiety-motivated goals. Successful men power through failure with consistency because they are not chasing after the warm and secure feeling of success, but rather pursue the limits of potential, and push hard into uncertainty without anxiety of whether people will accept them or the concern of how they will be perceived.

# Why you stop improving AKA the “good enough” mindset

Being security-oriented will often cause you to improve until you reach a point of security, which you will then get comfortable in, becoming unwilling to budge from until anxiety catches up once again. Beta men are motivated to take radical action only when they believe something is expected of them – they improve out of anxiety. You must leave that mindset behind. Security obsession is an inherently feminine trait. To cultivate a habit of constant improvement, don’t strive for some goal that you believe will magically alleviate your trauma-induced chronic anxiety – strive for growth, understanding, pushing the limits of what’s possible, and exploring the ever-expanding possibilities of your potential. Go beyond what the normies consider possible and expected. This will make you attractive to both women and men.

# The Security Obsession in Women

Consistently anxious people, which includes almost all women and most men, tend to pursue certain goals only because they are convinced that reaching them will finally relieve their ceaseless anxiety – this, however, never really relieves the anxiety, but it’s women’s only way of coping. This is one of the many reasons why women find micromanaging details and controlling other people very enjoyable. It’s why women so often try to control their surrounding in irrational ways – a man’s worst mistake is buying into that method and catering to their whims. Women don’t want that, because the anxiety remains. They desire a man who can go far beyond that. What women want is a man who transcends those petty worries and almost invalidates them, because a woman can admire that “unconcerned with pettiness” attitude.

One way to look at shit tests is as a manifestation of a woman’s anxiety in an attempt to test a secure frame. Most guys here know this. But to add to that, the reason why women are not interested in guys that fail shit tests, is that by doing so, you show her that you are just another **security-obsessed normie, stuck in mediocrity like her**, and she has enough of that on her own. Men with game are attractive, because they demonstrate they transcend social norms and the influence of public perception, and because of that can live lives that are extraordinary (which implies more intense emotional experiences) – and women want a piece of that.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

If there is one takeaway here, it is that as long as you are trying “not to lose”, you will never achieve anything exceptional, since you will always be stuck on a road to safety. Instead of avoiding losing, aim for winning at the expense of comfort and security. Chasing success as a label means chasing security and safety. Don’t strive for security – ***strive for transcendence.***

&#x200B;

1. Find out why and in what way you are caught up in adhering to the expectations of others
2. Free yourself from that concern through mindfulness
3. Independently determine your purposes, aiming for your personal transcendence, instead of security

842,fk7xbg,"Amidst the ongoing crisis that’s happening all over the world, everyone in this community/industry is at risk at losing their gainz. Nobody wants to lose any developed gainz over time. What’s the possible solution? Obviously you can either wait until the gyms are back and running, or if you are a creative brah you can always improvise. Seriously, there is no point complaining and feeling sad that the gyms are closed. We live and let live. The process just forces us to adapt. 

Luckily, youtube has a plethora of different platforms that promote bodyweight workouts, calisthenics to name a few. If you have little to no equipment at all, furnitures and other solid materials can be used as exercise equipment. 

Tomorrow will be day 1 of not having a premium gym, at least for me. I’ll be doing some bodyweight exercises and rep them to failure. Fortunately, in my home I have a barbell made out of concrete cement and I can improvise my workouts from that single equipment alone. But for those who really don’t have anything. I’m a good brah so I can provide some workouts for you guys. 

PUSH EXERCISES:

1. Push ups 
You can always progress your pushups by widening and narrowing your arms, as well as placing your foot on a chair to make it more declined giving your chest a much more harder push. Later on you can progress it by setting one arm pushups as your end goal in this temporary program. 

Diamond pushups are also good. 

2. Lateral raises 
If you don’t have any weights at home, you can always do Unloaded Lat Raises, where you just do the exact exercise and flexing your delts to failure. This is much better than no movement at all. 4 sets is a good metric til failure. Also, you can use a heavy book to add some weight, but bear in mind that grip will be compromised. 

3. Skull crushers 
This bodyweight exercise is good against a table or a solid platform. This mimics a push-up but with your elbows inclined giving that tricep some good activation. You can progress on this by decreasing the angle in which you push with your tris. 

LEG EXERCISES:

1. Bulgarian split squats 
You can do this by resting your leg on a chair and just do the exercise using bodyweight. Progress by either increasing the distance between the surface and your working leg, or you can have another chair placed across you where your working leg is on and do the exercise as it gives a deeper dip. 

2. Hip thrusts 
Pretty standard. Rest on a platform on a 45 degree angle and do the exercise. Progress by carrying a book or something heavy and do that until failure. 

3. Pistol squats
This alone can be pretty deadly for your legs. It requires balance, mastery and perfect execution to deliver a solid bodyweight squat. Progress by mastering the exercise, then carry something while doing it. It’s a pretty powerful workout that people underestimate so much. 

PULL EXERCISES:

1. Pull-ups 
If you don’t have any pull up bars at home, you can use a table and do some pulling under it. Progress by carrying a bag or something heavy. Repeat until failure. Progress by including your lower body as weight. 

2. If you have other recommendations for PULL EXERCISES, please include them especially for the ones without any equipment at all. So far, this is what I have, and with the barbell that I have I’ll be doing deadlifts and rows. 

ISOLATION EXERCISES: There are a handful that you can do that are a simple YouTube search away that require zero equipment at all. They are mostly core exercises. Don’t lose your abs brahs! 

1. Planks
2. Bicycle crunches 
3. L-sits 
4. Reverse crunches 
5. Calf raises 
6. Mountain climbers 
7. Burpees 

You don’t only want to just keep moving to maintain your gainz and not lose any as well. What the fitness world taught me is not only to be disciplined but also to set goals in the process. Try to set a different goal from now that would align with this and in time when things are back to normal, we can always rebound back to them gainz. 

In traditional bodybuilding, we set goals through progressive overload. In this case, and in my case, my goal right now is to learn how to execute a one arm push-up. I believe the above mentioned exercises can help me reach that goal. 

There are a lot of workout programs focusing on just body weights. Progressing them through different angles and variations help. Read on calisthenics. Chris Heria is a good platform of knowledge to start, but there are more brahs out there on YouTube who preach the same shit. 

Brahs, we’re all gonna make it. Never let this time at home spent just by sitting on the couch and watching Netflix. Always keep moving and we will be flexing once again. There’s no other way around it. 

When you get back at your gym, you’ll be thankful for learning what you didn’t know by doing these home workouts and applying them with better execution in the future. We are all in this together.

843,fkehnu,"This isn't going to be some bullshit diary blog post where I post up pictures like some Tinder obsessed tumblrina. We're gonna talk about technique. With all that is going on in the world right now, this is an excellent time to consider why focusing on half a dozen movements in the gym is detrimental to your overall success. 

First let's get some assumptions out of the way. Among those of you who will actually read this, only about one in five are actually going to the gym on a regular basis (meaning more than twice a week). Among those who do go regularly, many are only actually working a small number of muscle groups, and rarely work the opposite groups. For Example you'll see men who spend an inordinate amount of time on bench press without doing any pull exercise such as rowers to work the upper back. When this happens, you get disproportionate muscle build in the areas worked. Also, many make the mistake of not building the core, only occasionally working the front abdominals, and completely ignoring the obliques, hip flexors, and lumbar muscles. 

That's how you wind up looking like [this fellow.](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2487/0852/products/COVER_55f8ecab-0edd-4891-aeac-7c828d04d1ff_1200x1200_crop_center.png?v=1549199588) There are a **lot** of men who idolize Schwarzenegger's physique in the 80's, but the fact is that Schwarzenegger used steroids to get there, and using steroids is the loser's easy way out. It was also an expression of [form over function.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ef/0c/cb/ef0ccbfa60869fc62c8359ae90a04aa6.jpg) and ignoring core build up is a fantastic way to invite all manner of injuries ranging from hernias to spinal fractures. Your core is what allows you to ***CONTROL*** the weight you are lifting. 

What a nice opportunity for a segway. Another dangerous and idiotic thing you'll see in the gym is men who feel the need to throw on far more weight than they can reasonably control. [This is a perfect example of what I mean.](https://www.t-nation.com/system/publishing/articles/10000100/original/Fake-Strength-Stop-Arching-the-Bench-Press.jpg?1377118228) Stop. Just stop. It isn't impressive, and you will hurt yourself. Lifting is all about controlling the weight. If you can't bust the bar off the rack without help, it's too much for you. If you can't lower the bar down to your chest without raising your back off the bench it's too much for you. Swallow your fucking pride, take some weight off, and work up to that goal slowly. Lifting like the idiot in the picture is a good way to pull every muscle in your back, and kill yourself when you lose control of the bar and it falls on your neck. You want to push yourself, sure, but not to such extremes that it looks comical, and dangerous. Safety should be your primary concern. 

Next, we should touch on cardio. As in: among the few who actually take the time to work out, only a small percentage give any attention to cardio. Sure you can bench press the entire Dallas Cowboy cheerleader squad, but can you maintain a light jog for 15 minutes? *Why does it matter* you might ask? *I have the kind of physique that would make Schwarzenegger green with envy, and women throw themselves at me vagina first* you might say? Because sex is a workout, and it requires stamina. No woman is gonna be interested if you can't keep fucking for more than a couple minutes. *I'm so out of breath, gimme a minute*. ***NO*** You need to spend just as much time building stamina as you do in the gym building muscles. Run. Bike. Swim. Row. Whatever you have to do, just build stamina. You need to be able to keep it up for at least 15 minutes at a minimum without slowing down or stopping. Two miles. Two 8 minute miles isn't an absurd goal, and there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to achieve it. 

Finally, I'd like to touch on flexibility. We've all seen *El Gigantor* in the gym with upper arms bigger than our waist, who can bicep curl a bulldozer but can't raise his elbows above his ears. While impressive, this certainly has its limitations. You don't want to be the dude who can't put on a T shirt, or comb your own hair without help. You need to be able to maintain full range of motion while you build muscles. That means the ability to raise your arm over your head and touch the opposite shoulder, the ability to stretch your legs past a 90 degree angle *both forward and to the side*, and any other number of movements that I don't feel compelled to list. The fact is that there are three facets to fitness: Strength, mobility, and flexibility. All three are equally important. It would be an injustice to yourself to ignore one or more of those three in favor of focusing just one.",843,4.0,0.28439998626708984,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

Now this isn’t to say you should be a stuck up boring fuck who doesn’t know how to enjoy life. Enjoy life, but do so on your own terms while not straying on your mission or bending on your priorities.

Back in his bodybuilding days, Arnold Schwarzenegger would be in bed by 11 PM every night, even on Fridays while his friends were out partying and drinking, because it meant him getting the sleep necessary to recover and grow. 

The little things like going home a little early on Friday nights are the sacrifices you have to make to achieve the goals you set for yourself. 

Discipline and consistency will make you successful in reaching your long term goals. Hold yourself accountable. Be someone who sees the power of consistency, and take pride in setting yourself apart from the herd.",844,2.0,0.48010000586509705,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck"
845,fkcmxg,"  TL;DR - A basic overview on how equivilant salaries equated for salaried & self employed people. If you go self employeed you can pay less tax. You may have security or freedom. You can't have both.(unless you're super weathly)  
I've tried to keep the maths as simple as possible, but reintroduction of figures is needed at points. Hopefully it doesn't trip people up. If it does, get better at maths.

&#x200B;

Following on from a previous post I will outline a way in which the United Kingdom Tax system does this (HMRC) Comparing purchases & lifestyle choices made by a salaried employee vs. that of someone who runs a LTD company (1 employee/freelancer). 

I’m going to first set out a few key points that the future information will be built around. 

1) The pre-tax salary or profit will be £30,000. This as of 2019 is the average full time salary in the UK. 

2) It is based of you paying £250 per month into a private pension. (10% of pre-tax salary) 

3) I’m assuming the individual is single & has 0 dependents. So it keeps tax credits out of the equation. 

4) There are no student debt repayments to be made. 

5) They are sharing a house with one other individual. 

6) Food is calculated at £60 a week. Avg £260 per month. 

7) They have no car. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The average rent, council tax & basic bills in the UK are £650.14 (£483.5, £69.63, £97.01)

The salaried employee will take home each month. £1,795.   
 So they have £1144.86 to spend as they wish. 

Taking food into account they now have **£884.86** as disposable income.   
 

The self-employed individual pays tax on a yearly basis once their EOY accounts are done. 

Before this they take home £3000 a month. £719 is tax & NI free so covers any complications with paying tax on money needed for rent. 

10% into Private pension. 

£650.14 for rent bills etc.

They now have £2099.86.

Of this £68.69 of their tax-free allowance remains. 

Depending on the business. Food expense can be run through the business. Think coffee shop etc. So your business can feed you. It’s passed as a business expense.   
 

Accounting for food the self-employed person has **£1839.86** as disposable income. £955 more than the SE. Tax will need to be paid if this remains at the end of the year.   
 

They can now use this to help run their business by buying assets, equipment or “investment items” This can be art, computers, cars etc. It has to link into the business in someway. So you can’t buy flights to Paris with your LTR/FWB and run it through the business. Unless… There is a conference that weekend relevant to your industry. 

&#x200B;

**A short note on tax.**

  
 Dividends - You get £2000 as a tax-free dividend allowance. After that it’s 7.5% until you hit the higher rate (32.5%, >£50k total earnings p/a)   
 Income Tax & Ni – Whatever is remaining you’ll owe as if you were a normal salaried employee. 

To minimise the tax you pay you can some of the following through your business; 

Car, car insurance, fuel, Tv, computers, “Office” Furniture, flowers for your mum.   
 

**VAT – Value added tax**

You’ve seen those pissy feminist banging on about paying 20% tax on tampons? Well that’s VAT.   
 

If you’re business is VAT registered then you get to claim that additional 20% back on a monthly or quarterly basis. It’s on a lot of products which is really shouldn’t be. It was originally intended for “non-essential” goods.   
 

It features on adult clothes, fuel, toilet roll, soap, shower gel, most electronic items etc. Just ask for a VAT receipt when you next go to the supermarket and see how much you’re giving to HMRC for basic products.   
 

When you run them through your business this is where you get a nice double bonus. 

1) You can offset this as a business expense and reduce your personal tax bill. As you have less profit.

2) You get the VAT refunded.   
 

**E.g. 1**

You have to buy a new computer for you business. It costs £409. £68.17 of that is VAT. 

As a cost to a business it’s £340.83.

For the private individual to do this it costs £409. However if you recalculate it to pre-tax earnings, the true cost of what you need to earn. Then it is somewhere in the region of - £511.   
 

*Formula*   
 *(Pre tax earnings/post tax earnings) = (Pre tax computer / post tax computer)*   
 

**You’re paying tax twice. Once for your earnings & a second time on VAT.**   
 

Finally to compare the two tax bills on the £30000 earnings. For ease of calculation.   
 1) They both spend £884.86 of their income/business expense. 

2) They live equivalent lives. 

The Salaried employee has £0 left. But all tax & NI is paid. £5462 in total. 

The self-employee has £17381.68 in “profit” including their tax-free allowance. £2000 for dividends has already been removed.   
 

They pay £396 in tax for the year. £1063 in NI. A total of £1459. 

Just by a simple change in employment status the difference is **£4003.** Both have £3000 in a private pension & a £750 HMRC contribution. No personal savings however. 

*I’ve left out some obvious elements*

1) No sick pay for self employed persons.

2) You’ll probably need an accountants help with some things. 

3) If your business is VAT registered then some work e.g. consultancy is VAT applicable. So can mess with your VAT refunds. 

4) There are some worker protections for employed staff. However these are being eroded in the UK.   
   
 That’s a very basic overview of how tax works. I’m not an accountant so these figures won’t be 100% but are an example of how it works.

846,fjmm5q,"It shouldn't surprise anyone here that the Red Pill is packed with Beta Males. In fact, it's absolutely crawling with them. The problem with any forum on masculinity is that it inevitably gets filled with unmasculine men who have their own theories on masculinity. Unavoidably the forum starts catering down to what the beta males already do and therefore want to hear. In other words, reductive power point style lists, conduct manuals, and explanations on why their current behavior is okay. What they desperately want to believe is that the behavior that they are forced to exhibit in their heavily taxed 9-5 corpo cuck job will magically get them laid, even though it’s not and is actually pulling them down into a soul draining spiral of depression.

Sexual Selection is a means by which females chose exciting new phenotypes for the next generation. Females want the fastest antelope, the loudest songbird and the most obnoxious douchebag. They want the male who has what others don't and can thus disrupt the status quo. Beta Males are the status quo which is why their whole strategy is imitation. If you are using pickup lines you are by definition a beta male as you are sexually reliant on imitating the mating strategies of other males. You have admitted to yourself that you are uninteresting, incapable of becoming interesting and need to fool women into believing you are something that you are not. Alpha males win the race. Beta males buy trophies so they can trick people and themselves into thinking they won the race. If you are interested in seeing this latter behavior first hand, head over to the seduction subreddit. But I must warn you they are complete and utter fags.

Next we should answer the question: When and why is it necessary to AMOG aka establish social dominance? First and foremost, we need a clear definition of what a beta male is. A beta male is a mushy turd that takes the shape of his immediate surroundings. Beta males prefer comfort over abstract freedom. They enjoy the warmth and security of the herd and spent their youth being molded into the perfect worker drone consumer by media and education system. They're comfortable with how things are and dislike change. Therefore if you are pushing for change or advocating for something that is different from the norm you must first break the will of the beta males so they stop clucking and shut the fuck up. Obviously the big picture of what you're trying to accomplish will remain a complete mystery to beta males because they are pragmatards who don't think top down or think in terms of potentiality. In other words, whenever you try to accomplish anything big you will be called an asshole, crazy or dismissed with an all-inclusive meaningless label. That's okay. No one accomplished anything meaningful without being hated on in the process, just ask Steve Jobs. Extraordinary men must give themselves permission to perform extraordinary acts so they can rise above the ordinary.

**Write An Article On AMOGing Beta Males:** The easiest way to AMOG the most Beta Males is to write an article about AMOGing Beta Males. It's pretty simple and has an interesting element of recursion. The key takeaway is understanding why this works. Beta Males are insecure about an endless assortment of trivialities. These insecurities are then weaponized against beta males to make them compensate with overpriced GQ commodities, man up and get married and work a bullshit job until they die. Beta Male insecurities are like MKULTRA control words, they shut down thinking and induce compliance. My advice is to figure out what beta males are insecure about and mention it as casually as possible. Then when the beta male predictably spergs out, use their sperg out as an excuse to exclude them from the decision making process. In other words, exactly how I'm going to use this post to ban a bunch of sensitive losers.

**Do You Even Lift Bro:** The easiest way to increase your SMV, become more confident and have a higher tolerance for stress is to put in serious work at the gym. It's never been easier to find a gym nearby because there's more of them than ever before. Gyms are far better equipped than even 10 years ago. Finally, Bodybuilding is no longer a secretive cult like it was in the 1960s-1990s. All the information you'll ever need is available on YouTube or Amazon bookstore. At this point there is literally no excuse beyond being lazy or retarded. Beta Males know looking like shit is their fault and their fault alone. Broaching the topic directly or just looking fit, is enough to remind them of this fact and send them into an AMOGed spiral. Every article on lifting has hordes of betas crying how jumping jacks in their mom's basement is a legitimate form of exercise. Blue checkmark Twitter is upset that Bronze Age Mindset and fans post physique. Lifting is the universal AMOG. When men feel insecure, their girlfriends notice and look to the source of the insecurity for an opportunity to branch swing. In my experience it's not muscularity itself that gets you laid it's the high stress tolerance gained from becoming muscular and women noticing how other men behave towards you.

**ASStimidation:** while the previous sections explain general AMOGing principals, this section puts it all together in a practical way for a common place situation. Anyone who's spinning plates in 2020 knows that these tardettes are constantly on social media farming their orbiters for validation. What if I told you that there was an easy way to make the orbiters work in for you? Anyone who has been following Red Pill's lifting advice aka applying the Red Pill should have a thick muscular ass from squatting and deadlifting. Steal her phone and then Snapchat or Instagram story a pic of your ass to her orbiters with a flirty caption ""feeling like a snack."" Wait 20 minutes and send a second pic revealing whose ass it is captioned ""y'all niggas gay"". Within an hour her phone should be blowing up with angry ASStimidated beta males explaining how a mean Alpha hurt their *feeeelings* by AMOGing them. Beta males are two things: thirsty for sexy pics and on the brink of abandoning heterosexuality. If questioned tell her that you were feeling sexy and that you didn't know that all her guy friends are gay.

A lot of men mistakenly believe that being Alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident. Alpha males don't act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition. Things work in the human world exactly how they work in the animal world. Competition can be physical, musical, financial, intellectual or psychological. Beta males hate competition and hide behind contrived morals to justify their uncompetitiveness. Masculinity is competition. The most masculine animals are the most competitive ones. There is no climbing the dominance hierarchy without competing against other men and AMOGing them in some way. If your goal is to get to the top, you can't just sit around defensively passing shit tests—you have to actively compete against other men.


Since everything is currently going into lockdown now is the perfect time to focus on self improvement.

847,fjwc1l,"There's a couple mindsets that get emphasized here and they are exclusive of each other.

The first is how to get laid. The second is being indifferent to whether you get laid or not.

I see this confuse people because posts often make it sound that by not caring, suddenly girls will feel challenged and do the work for you: opening, closing, and consistently hitting you up to get fucked. That is generally not going to happen for 99% of men. Especially not with hot women.

Being indifferent, going monk mode, or having the IDGAF attitude generally will not get you laid. If you're a pro-athlete, big dick in your industry, or the hot DJ this week it'll happen. Otherwise, you need to work. Don't be a clown, don't be needy, but get to work and care about the results of your work.

It's freeing to have the indifferent mindset at times because it allows you to perform at a high level with other things. For example: I was indifferent to chicks during law school and achieved the things I needed to do. Immediately before and immediately afterwards, I fucked everything that moved. There's a time and place for both.

If you want to get laid and spin plates with regularity then it takes work. You have to care about the goal because that means you pursue and own the results. It requires a mindset completely opposite of the former. It requires an outgoing personality. It takes consistent lifting and eating. It means being persistent with opening, leading, closing, and following up with chicks that you want to fuck or want to keep fucking. After that, they're hooked and will hit you up. You don't get hung up on chicks who don't pan out because you're already onto the next, and you're constantly restocking the pool of potential plates. That is the IDGAF aspect of this mindset.

When you have the time in your life to pursue getting laid, then you need to get laid, a lot. You need to study game and get big. Every man needs to fuck a lot of women to understand the feeling of ownership and leadership that men need to experience. You need to feel that dominance over women because it's in our nature. It takes effort and persistence to sharpen your game and frame. That way, when you need to adopt one mindset or the other, you have the experience and confidence that you can do what you need to do, when it needs to be done.

TDLR: There is a mindset to getting laid and there is a mindset of being indifferent. Both have their roles. When you're going to adopt one mindset, adopt it fully.",847,2.0,0.49459999799728394,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck"

Pretty much everything is already said, read the sidebar, lift , do what you want in life and don't be a little bitch and when things don't go your way, work harder or change approach. And hey this sub has gone to utter shit because the ""alpha"" guys realised it's not all about the girls and how to do cold approach. You guys are too sex depraved to realise there are more important things in life than getting a smelly pussy.

Anyways quick post . Stop trying to entertain every girl you meet. Stop trying to find the next line in your chat, stop trying to pick up the conversation after a dead silence or pause. Why do YOU have to be the entertainer and the one to keep the pace up. Let the girl do the work for once. These b are getting too adhd by the constant likes and approval of instagram and they can't even form half a sentence nowadays. 

It's not your job to do that. An interesting girl will keep the convo up. An interesting girl will ask you questions too because she genuinely cares or is just a decent human being. If you go out with a b and you feel like you are doing an interview, that's because that's what's happening. It's not supposed to be like this. I get it you may not have many common points but there are so many things to talk about if you know how to converse. 

I'm not going out lately a lot, I used to do that when I was younger. Now my lifestyle has almost taken care of that lol. Girls see me doing interesting shit and they hit me up and say it'd be nice to meet you. Why? Because most people are doing nothing with their lives. I see my family all glued up to a phone. Retards. Don't be like this. And if your friends are like this, change them. Go fucking monk mode until you meet new people.

This also applies to chatting. I know many of you like this way of communication and I get it. It's instant , it's fast . But it only hurts you and your perception. Be busy. Keep texting only for logistics. Don't waste all your subjects in chatting. Tell that to her in person. And you are not supposed to be a fucking shoe carpet for m'ladies. If they are boring, if they respond with an emoji or a thumbs up, don't even bother don't even tell them to fuck off . Don't even try to think of the next interesting line. Just skip this b and live your life. Let them do the work once. Don't answer. or answer with just a thumbs up or emoji. Freak her out a bit. Don't be the average fedora tipper. Have some fucking pride and respect for yourself.

I know, you are insecure now, and some may not have sex at all but ..whatever, experience can't be transferred. I'll try to answer to any questions tomorrow. But be your best self guys .

849,fixp7a,"I’m piggy backing off /u/theredpillfinance here and his useful articles on investing.   
 

Along side your long-term investments, not spending money frivolously. To help keep more money in your pocket, a potentially important skill in life is bargaining/haggling. This is related to smaller purchases <£1000 etc.   
 

If you’ve had your eye on a certain product for a while and saved up enough money to buy it outright. You’ll be able to save some money easily by just asking for it.   
 

This advice generally applies to quality goods that have higher margins than products you can buy online etc. But are made by local or bespoke suppliers. Think watches, suits or specialist sports equipment. Send hand equipment is another are it can be used.   
 

Brick & Mortar shops are crying out for trade and will gladly take some money off the market prices to get your cash in their pocket.   
 

E.g. I purchased a watch last year the RRP was £750. Nothing too extravagant, but I wanted a nice watch to celebrate closing a chapter of my life. I liked the look of the watch and asked the assistant the price. 

Me – “How much for X?”  
 

SA – “£750 sir”  
 

Me – “Hmm ok, may I try it on?”   
 

SC – “Sure”  
 

Then a bit of back a forth about me. Normal salesmen spiel.   
 

SC – “So what do you think?   
 

Me – “I like it, but I’m not sure on the price.”  
 

SC – “We could do it for £650, if you would like?”  
 

Me – “That’s an improvement. But how much for cash?”  
 

SC – “I’ll check with my boss.” (Comes back a few minutes later) “£550, cash sir”   
 

Me – I’ll take it.   
 

In addition to just asking, I went in towards the end of a quiet month. When I knew they would be trying to hit sales targets before being appraised for their bonuses. I did some research on the watche(s) I wanted too.   
 

In business cash flow is one of the most critical elements to keeping the doors open. So use it to your advantage. You must be willing to walk away if you don’t like the price. (I bought an expensive suit by not following this advice)  
**Don’t get attached to the item.**   
 

I very rarely pay full price for anything now. However I generally only buy higher quality items. I’ve found they last longer, look better. Over the long run work out cheaper than multiple lower quality items. (Item cost/days of use)   
 

N.B. I know that jewellers know they will have to bargain with customers and put an inflated price on their stock. So they may knock a few quid off to seem like they are giving a good deal, to begin with.

I'll discuss some interesting facts about CV19 that I learned from family in the healthcare industry and which stock has rocketed to my #1 position in my watch list.

* Core information will cover CV19's updated morbidity rate thanks to South Korea, which is 0.75%, and what that means for the US. If we had as much capacity in our hospitals as they do we'd probably see a similar rate. Unfortunately we're closer in the number of hospital beds per capita similar to Italy. 

* Additionally, thanks to this damn thing starting in China, our supply chain is broken and many of our medical staff no longer have personal protective items to keep them safe and doctors and nurses are succumbing to the illness.

* Lastly, investors in CMG will be big winners once this is all over.  They've already fallen about 40% from their high, but will remain open during the various closures as take-out, so the damage to their profitability will mollified, unlike many other restaurant chains.",850,1.0,0.4812000095844269,"life, work, rape, stop, mgtow, word, female, turn, high, keep"

Tbh I'll give the relationshit place credit. They were very well aware of the strength difference between men and women. Even the female commenters self reported getting overpowered by smaller men. But a reoccurring theme with the OP's gf and even female commenters is just how SURPRISED they were when they first realised the strength gapm

Let's take a look shall we...

> I (21M) met her (20F) 6 months ago. We go to the same college.

Seems to have LTR'd her either just before or during the CC. LTR during college is a bad sign, but oh well.

> Now we would usually wrestle for fun but I'd always let her win. I think she took pride in winning but whenever I told her I wasn't going serious, she would say ""yeah right"" . But if it made her happy it wasn't an issue.

Didn't assert his dominance, and let her win for ""her happiness"". Very BP signs.

Also notice how she says ""yeah right""? Her deluded brain actually believes she is winning. 

> Now I'm not a big guy. I'm about 5""10 and 175lbs. I'm skinny fat basically. 

TLDR - I look like shit.

> I occasionally lift weights so I'm pretty strong. 

Translation - I've been to the gym 2 or 3 times.

> She's 5""11 and 165-170lbs. She plays Volleyball for our college at a competitive level, so she's an athlete.

Okay, so his GF is a competitive collegiate athlete and basically the same size as OP.

> Well the other day she initiated another wrestle and I let her win, until she said ""ok let's see what you got"". I wasn't sure what she meant so I asked her and she asked me to go serious.

OP's girlfriend begins to wake up from delusion. She knows he isn't really trying. But has deluded herself to believe she can still stand a chance.

> So we wrestled and I pinned her rather quickly. She tried to break free but couldn't. 

Reality manifests itself. Reality is that despite being of similar size and way less athletic, he's still **far** stronger than her. 

> I could tell she was a bit shaken so she asked to go again, and we went again but i got her in a headlock. 

OP's gf is ""shaken"", aka her reality is being shattered. She is realizing the lies that BP society and feminism have taught her. 

> I didn't squeeze too hard, but just enough to hold her and she tapped. We went a third time and i pinned her.

OP says he ""didn't squeeze too hard"", meaning that he's STILL holding back and easily winning. Even with restrained strength, he makes her tap in a regular headlock (not even a real chokehold).

> At that point she seemed confused and things got a bit awkward. 

""Confused"" means that she's realised what she's been told is a complete lie.

> She then told me she never knew I was serious when I said I wasn't really trying.

Aka her hamster brain was spinning so much that she genuinely thought she was winning. 

> Since then, her mood has been lower. She's usually bubbly but this time I noticed she was low and a bit mopey. 

OP's girlfriend is adjusting to her new reality, as she has realized the extent of male strength. Hell she probably doesn't even know that he was STILL holding back when he beat her.

OP mentions in another comment that he is ""quite strong"" because he bench presses 80kg. Make what you will of that, but benching your own BW isn't that impressive by lifting standards. He probably is stronger than the average dude (who apparently can only bench 60kg), but whatever.

TLDR -, **a skinny fat male with minimal lifting experience and lack of athletic background, completely DESTROYED a female collegiate volleyball player of the same size, while holding back.**

852,fimeq4,"**TL:DR - Calling your biggest compulsion of all a choice has to be the greatest irony in history. Taking credit for everything that's actually done by nature and calling it ""choice"" is dumb. ""Love is a choice"" is the mother of BP delusions.**

Today a whatsapp group of which I am also a part of (part family, part friends) has a heated discussion over a celebrity figure talking about her friend cheating with another guy. Naturally they also come up with men who cheat and the discussion goes on as to what's acceptable in a relationship and what's not. 

And you know the word comes up that feminists are so fond of using? Choice. The celebrity girl used the word and all others caught on to it. Apparently it was a moral choice. Apparently love is a <cough, cough> CHOICE! The rest is on the lines of ""blah blah blah, choice. blah blah"" - the usual rhetoric (women's dialogues seem so scripted with RP eyes that I swear they probably rehearse these lines in their circles). A woman should have the choice to be with who she wants...

The discussion went on aimlessly over a question of choices after that. The irony? We're talking about something where no only really chooses, only their bodies do.

Women's need to use the word ""choice"" is directly proportional to their internal feeling of being a victim (because only a starving man is obsessed with food). And honestly, it's utterly absurd that they describe their relationships as a ""choice"". Pragmatic yes, but far less of a choice than anyone wants to admit.

Relationships can't really work well only on conscious logic. If you think sexual instincts are Machiavelian, relationships that are entirely based on rational logic and pragmatism are much worse. They end up only considering the provider and become an emotionally soul-less, cold blooded business transaction. It's only a question of how soon the provider becomes a diving board for men that are actually attractive that one can fall in love with. The rational mind making entirely logical choices -- is only for the robots. 

Let's go beyond logic and consider a much more powerful form of choice. What would happen if we had true choice over our bodies and emotions? Just think - what would it be if you could truly love and be happy at will? Ideally, you'd have complete control over your biochemistry and therefore you could fall in love with anyone, or even experience all those feelz even if no one was around. You could be blissed out and totally content. Ironically this could make you so self sufficient that the very need for relationships could go DOWN. A breakup would be nothing more than a bump on the road. If she was also that way and you both chose to be in a relationship, it would be pretty incredible and idyllic. 

Also, if she could truly choose love, that beta husband might actually be loved and find great sex and respect for once (not that this is actually good for him to stay complacent and a fatass). If you could truly choose, you could also choose not to cheat and be no worse off for it.

If love was a choice, attraction and seduction would never be as important as they are. Temptation would lose its hold over you. Orbiters wouldn't have to exist. Love would become....easy.

If sex was a choice, there would be no dead bedrooms...

Love as a choice is the ultimate BP dream. If it were true, your blue pilled dreams would actually become true. Unconditional love would be a reality.

Does ANY of this ever happen? No. 

In fact this is probably at the root of all BP delusions, that love as we see it is something that can happen at will. It is why people try so hard when they realize a relationship isn't working and end up doing exactly the wrong things. 

The only choice literally lies in picking out one guy from a list of boys all ready to throw themselves at her boots. Even that isn't much of a rational conscious choice - it goes by feels. If it was choice, relationships could function by logic and principles. But they don't.

Sex is man's second biggest biological compulsion after the survival instinct, and today in prosperous times it is the biggest. Attraction is not really a choice. It happens to you. **Being as attractive as possible can be a choice, but the whole process of attraction itself runs on instinct**. Sex is such an enormous naturally created compulsion that you might find the biggest sex scandals emerging especially in places where people try very hard to pretend they're above it.

Think of just how hard it is to stop yourself from giving your dick (and women their clits or breasts) a free pass. If it just revs up the drive a bit, you just can't resist. Your sex instincts are kept in just enough control so that you can function normally at work, sometimes not even that much. You have a bit of control over some fine details on just how you wanna use your dick, but you have no control over the the sex instinct itself.

Are your thoughts under control? Nah, your brain churns out tens of thousands of them all the fucking time, maybe a dozen ideas of which are actually relevant and useful. 

Your emotions? They're essentially reactions to whatever happens. They drive you into obsession and often you're powerless to resist. Name any emotion that came up at will at full power the moment you wished for it. Never. **Emotions are reactions, not choices. At their proactive best they are a driving force of desire, but not really choice**. Life would become too simple if you could just summon happiness, passion, drive and romance at will. Your sex drive comes easy, because first of all it's barely in control to begin with.

The need for relationships or emotional fulfillment aren't choices either. They're hardwired into biology. Speaking of biology, what about your body? You can only consciously control some of your muscles, some of the time. Otherwise you can't control a damn thing that happens in a single cell in your body. It's all nature doing everything for you. To rebuild your body, you slog at the iron temple for years, but the detailed repair work? Your body rebuilds itself, you just get to control your reps and diet. You can't fix a single cell in this body on your own.

Give yourself complete freedom for sometime, no rules, no discipline, no restraint. What happens? You self destruct in a mess of depression and addictions. Most of these celebrities are in fact walking train wrecks behind the scenes, they even make good publicity from their shit. But that's not what you wanted. You said you wanted to live by free choice. Why would you choose to make your life hell? Logically, you would choose to live wisely and blissfully right? 

Look at what you did, not what you said. **Because you are NOT free, your haven't made a choice at all. What you really did was to give all your compulsions a free pass, with no limiters and no discretion**. You are a hypocrite for thinking you actually had as much control over your ""choices"" as you think. Some of the biggest wrecks in human history are people who believed they were truly free. The people who found freedom to shape their lives were in fact very disciplined and focused.

And you expect someone more emotionally sensitive than you to somehow make love and sex a choice? It's hilarious, this pretense that you have somehow mastered yourself.

This goes even further when they talk about other choices - it could be about anything. Look at every single one of them, and soon you'll see there's no choice in what is essentially compulsive hive mind behavior.

Women give themselves a lot of credit for creating new life via pregnancy, often acting like they're doing it. But what they're really doing is putting up with the pain and suffering and experience of a natural process. It is nature that builds every cell in your body. We just have a bit of control over diet, exercise, habits and medical help, but really, the body is just building itself. We take way too much credit for ourselves. All we can do is just make nature's work easier.

It even goes to the choice to abort. Well, the need to choose that only exists because before that, there was a moment where the sex instinct overrode all choice. Unfortunately pregnancy after sex isn't a choice either.

So when they come to you and say ""A woman has a choice..."" or that ""They chose a relationship..."" or when you hear some celebrity spout the choice nonsense, start laughing. Choice doesn't exist nearly anywhere on the scale we think it does. Not by orders of magnitude. When they say my choice, just replace it with ""My compulsive instinct"" and you will free yourself from all illusion.

The obsession with choice has come from a subconscious knowing that we're not really in control of all that much, and we're not willing to admit it as this will make us look like we're slaves to our bodies and minds, which we are. Accepting that keeps us humble and actually choose for once. But you know, to admit the truth to ourselves is too hard. By selling the narrative of choice, all we've ever done is to delude ourselves while our instincts run riot.

Love, attraction and sex are compulsions - love is the mother of all compulsions. The only thing you can do is to choose if you want attraction or revulsion. Choose the right one, or else invariably, inevitably, you will be forced to deal with the other. 

So when people say ""You can't force someone to love you"", they're not really talking about absolute choice, even if that's what they believe. No one has such power over their minds and bodies or relationships - if someone really did, they'd bypass the entire circus it takes to find love. What they really mean is, ""Love isn't possible without setting your compulsive biological instincts free"". 

To that I'll add ""within healthy boundaries"".

You can only work with the forces of nature and keep those compulsions in healthy boundaries - you have only that much choice. All you can do is help nature do its job more easily and not get in the way. Ensure you are sufficiently attractive and lay down the boundaries, for which you might have to undo a lifetime of bad habits. 

Now breaking old habits definitely requires you to make a choice, for once. Your conscious mind has to override old dysfunctional pathways and rewire your brain in the process. That's literally the only place in life where you actually choose. And you still wouldn't have chosen had you not been hit by a painful bolt of red lightning.

853,fi973v,"[Juvenal 6](http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/juvenal_satires_06.htm) , commonly titled ""The Ways of Women"" in English, is a Latin poem written nearly 2000 years ago. Critics have described it as: 
>""not merely a diatribe against women, but an all-out invective against marriage... This decaying of Rome's social and moral standards has caused marriage to become the offspring of greed and corruption. Men have become weak, and allow women challenge male supremacy so that marital power relations now favor women."" 


Sounds a lot like today, huh? Here's a little snippet from the actual writing:

>Never will you find a woman who spares the man who loves her; for though she be herself aflame, she delights to torment and plunder him. So the better the man, the more desirable he be as a husband, the less good will he get out of his wife. No present will you ever make if your wife forbids; nothing will you ever sell if she objects; nothing will you buy without her consent. She will arrange your friendships for you; she will turn your now-aged friend from the door which saw the beginnings of his beard""


>""Crucify that slave!"" says the wife. ""But what crime worthy of death has he committed? "" asks the husband; ""where are the witnesses? who informed against him? Give him a hearing at least; no delay can be too long when a man's life is at stake!"" ""What, you numskull? You call a slave a man, do you? He has done no wrong, you say? Be it so; but this is my will and my command: let my will be the voucher for the deed."" Thus does she lord it over her husband. But before long she vacates her kingdom; she flits from one home to another, wearing out her bridal veil; then back she flies again and returns to her own imprints in the bed that she has abandoned, leaving behind her the newly decorated door, the festal hangings on the walls, and the garlands still green over the threshold. Thus does the tale of her husbands grow; there will be eight of them in the course of five autumns----a fact worthy of commemoration on her tomb!


I linked the entire poem above if you'd like to read it and don't mind the heavy cultural references, but these few paragraphs alone tell so much. They show that female nature is indeed female NATURE, the same value-less behavior was going on in other societies thousands of years ago. 


So, once again, we've allowed women equal opportunity to shape our society and culture, and have arrived at the same emasculating pit-fall as the Romans did. We're at a crossroads: we can allow the path we're on to continue and end up as they did, with their society slowly degrading until they were conquered by invading tribes of disorganized barbarians. Or: we can make a change, stand up for ourselves, and return to the values of the ancestors that carried us this far. The onus lies with you, with us.

For those that care, I found Redpill philosophy early on, and have deeply ingrained it in my worldview. Some of the best advice I have ever received is: ""Learn the theory, then throw it all away"". Once you have fully explored and absorbed the knowledge available here, you're not doing yourself much good by continuing to read it over and over and over again, ad nauseam. There comes a point where you need to step away, stop learning theory, and start integrating into real life. You will begin to see the philosophy you've learned manifested in real life, and will gravitate towards the writings, art, and actions that align with your worldview. Through this is how you truly change yourself, and the world. The awakening you've had will never go away.",853,4.0,0.5267999768257141,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

I'm a big comedy fan.  But, post red pill, it's been more difficult to admire my former [heroes](https://therationalmale.com/2017/06/13/kill-your-idols/).

""Theogate"" in the comedy community is the rumor that Theo Von slept with Christina Pazsitzky, Tom Segura's wife.  Tom and Christina are widely beloved in the comedy community, and her affair would be a bummer.

Christina and Theo Von have both denied the rumors. Tom and Christina decided to bring Theo on their podcast to squash the beef.

Body Language Drama YouTuber takes some interest in the situation.  We can **feel** the tension in the room.

The Body Language Drama expert knows that Christina is hiding something.  Theo is pretty relaxed throughout the whole thing, and denies anything happened.  Christina is anxious that Tom will get upset. Why would Tom get upset if there wasn't an affair?

The answer, of course, is AWALT.  Christina was hitting on Theo.  She wanted to have an affair, and Theo denied her advances.

The Body Language Drama interpretter cannot come to this conclusion.  Women have never hit on him. He's never seen women be the sexual aggressor before, so he can't figure out what's happening.

He doesn't know AWALT so he cannot figure it out.

Theo Von and Tom Segura are the physical embodiment of Alpha and Beta.

This story has a minor happy ending in that it looks like Theo and Christina didn't sleep together.  Doesn't mean she hasn't cheated on him with others.

It's fascinating to me to watch the blue pill mind run circles around the obvious conclusion - she's not loyal.  The reason she's uncomfortable is she doesn't want to be called out for hitting on Theo.  The villian - in this drama - is her.

Conclusion: Even body language experts need to swallow the red pill.  If you don't see it, you literally don't see it.  He can't figure out the social dynamic of her aggressively hitting on Theo, since he's never seen this dynamic before.

Currently the whole world is in panic over COVID-19 and with good reason. Companies are shutting down. People are working from home. People are stockpiling food, toilet paper and Purell. Although I think the latter is unnecessary and just people freaking out YOU need to be the guy that’s not freaking out. You need to be the leader in whatever situation you might find your self in. Prepare for the worst with out invoking fear of those around you. You need to be the rock in the face of chaos. You need to be the one confident in making decisions. You need to maintain frame and calmness in front of your friends, family, plates, LTR, and everyone else around you.

**Situational Awareness & Making Decisions**

Take inventory of your surroundings and what is going on. Your average person is panicking and has no idea what to do. Your job may have no idea how to handle this. You need to be using sound judgment while maintaining emotional control.

For example the CEO of my company as of yesterday evening is mandating people come into the office that houses 700 people and is open to the public and resides in NYC. They are presenting a major risk to the people that work here while 90% of peoples jobs here can be done remote. We have people coming in from areas that are quarantined because they are in fear of losing there job (your average person is too stupid to make the right decision here). People are freaking out and being morbid in the office. Not doing any work just bitching and fear mongering about getting infected and asking people why are we here.

Your job doesn't know what's best for you. It’s a hard thing to walk away from your job but its stupid to listen to company who cant see that most major organizations have started WFH/remote work or putting it in place. This company is flat out telling people to come in even though we have the technology to have everyone work remote and still do business. In times like this is where being a leader and exercising those Machiavellian skills you learned here come into play.

I wrote an email this morning saying I'm sick and am quarantining my self. End of story. If they want to fire me so be it I will find a job in the next few weeks.  

It’s a risky decision but I know what's best for me and my family. I know I can get a job else where. 

Being a leader involves making risky decisions. You know what's best. Do it. 

Bad leaders get people killed.

**Update:** My company had to change their tone based on local government. They remained opened until the 9th. They emailed us on 3/19 and notified us several people were infected during the the time they insisted we come into the office after saying for a week no one in the company was infected. Most of the infected people were on my floor that I work on which is overcrowded with people. 

This only validates my actions.

856,fh1gvt,"..You should start.

&#x200B;

This is basically a long story regarding how I landed a model. It's more or less a play by play from using and being mindful of side bar material and shouldn't be something new to anyone that's been TRP aware but a decent refresher.

&#x200B;

I'll start off by saying that I'm not bad looking. This isn't to disregard RP ideology and game. Same rules apply to me but I get a few more passes because of genetics and good habits (dress well, lift, social etc).

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago a friend of mine needed someone to model for her to do a drag show. I do a side gig with photography and I thought it'd be a great way to get some exposure with some new faces and also network so I signed up. She knows that I am a bit of a playboy and didn't want me to trigger anyone or anything since this is her livelihood. I agreed and away we go.

&#x200B;

Let me chime in that I have let myself go in a bit. I still remain active but a recent injury has resulted in me not being as active as I used to be. Most of my frame is there but I did get my body fat % up to the point where my abs aren't as visible as they used to be. That comes up later.

&#x200B;

Back to the story.

&#x200B;

So I go in and right away notice this really attractive make up artist (Vietnamese/Irish mix HB9 with stereotypical Asian dimensions) . We make eye contact and I smile but I was going to behave and just continue on. Turns out that I caught her attention and she instantly went to see from her friend about me and my story. I don't know any of this as I'm making sure to connect with everyone; including this transitioning thing and I'm pretty sure what some would refer to as a militant feminist type.

&#x200B;

Most of the day goes by pretty chill, I basically make people laugh and enjoy myself. She gets great marks and I network with the person that runs the event to show up and take some photos next time. All is good. **Social Proof**

&#x200B;

Now, since I was brought in by a woman this woman, let's call her D, knows that I'm an attractive social guy and have been vetted. I'm not showing any signs of autism so she makes a habit of walking around to my side of things. My friend catches this and gives me an OK go ahead.

&#x200B;

On lunch, I make small talk with her. **Approach!!**

&#x200B;

The convo doesn't really matter. What matters was the body language. She responded to touch, she was OK with slightly flirty banter but I didn't escalate since I didn't want to create a scene. I took her number and exited before I could do something stupid.

&#x200B;

I waited 2 days to respond/hit her up. I didn't do it because I was doing it to appear busy. I legit didn't have the time and didn't want to make this into a pen pal thing but I also didn't want to sit on it too long. She showed interest best to move fast before some random dick goes into the mix. **Text game**

&#x200B;

Keeping it simple, I told her that I liked her work and that she's pretty cute herself. **Make this man to woman.**  She responded pretty well and we chatted up a bit ( few sentences) before I gave her a date. She took it and we went out to 'hang out'. This gives me an in to see where she's OK with because while she did show interest her texting was almost analytical.

&#x200B;

On Friday night I pick her up from her house. She is late. Nothing major but at least 5 minutes and I text her that I'm going to meet her if she needs more time. **Test 1.**

She comes out looking really made up. The whole package was dressed up in almost a body suit. I'm not sure how to describe it but think professionally sexy with a bit of cleavage exposed. Apologizes and we go on our date.

&#x200B;

The date is simple. I go to a place that I normally visit that's got great live music, it's downtown, I'm good with the staff, and it serves alcohol and coffee so it's good for everything really. I'm in good spirits and we're shooting the shit while I'm driving. I start to probe about her. Turns out she's in a lesbian relationship. **Test 2**

Some guys would get butt hurt on this and I was actually confused since I got a very flirty vibe but I figured best case is I have a fun lesbian friend that can wing me or model for me. Worst is that I get to enjoy live music with someone pretty. **Outcome independence.**

We get to the place and she tells me that she doesn't drink coffee or wine  and likes sweet liquors (like 80% of the selection is now off limits), I tell her to order a beer, I'll treat her but I've got get something from her car. **Test 3**

&#x200B;

In my car I've got a bottle of black berry liquor that I bought on a whim to enjoy with a date. I figured let's make this interesting. I come back. Ask the owner for two glasses and tell her that we should get to know each other.

Classic drinking game. Stop me if you've done this before.

We share a story. If you've done it. You take a drink.

**""I'm not going to sleep with you.""**

**- Sure**

I'm going to skip a lot of the nonsense filler but I basically find out that she's in a relationship because of obligation (her GF took care of her and paid for shit for her to be here etc.), she's actually bi, she liked me but thought I was shy **(why you guys need to be SEXUALLY AGGRESSIVE AND POLARIZING)** because I didn't hit on her right away. I tell her she's cute but I wasn't sure if we're compatible. She asks me what I think now. I tell her we'll see by the end of the night.

&#x200B;

From touching her hand, face, to her hips to vagarious compliance tests it leads to the fact that I was going to cheat and kiss her. She can stop me or let it happen. She let's me kiss her passionately. I look into her eyes and say 'yea that's not good. Let me do that again.' Kiss her with even more passion.

People start to look over our table, I smile and nod.

She's telling me that she didn't expect it to go so well. I tell her let's go. We head to my car and start to make out.

You can't make a woman do anything. You need to guide her to the conclusion. She was wet and turned on. She felt like she can be a slut with me because I didn't judge her for fucking around on her GF. I was being a man and she found me attractive to start.

Kisses turn to making out, making out leads to breasts coming out, I tell her to touch my cock and she goes to it right away without any resistance whatsoever. Before I know it I'm getting quite possibly the best head I've got in my life.

I finish and she needs the rest room. We go to a nearby bar and she goes to the washroom while I just wait. The scene is not to our taste so we go back to my car and fuck. No ideal but holy shit was she horny and needing this. I'm just about done and want to drop her off at her house.

She tells me that she wants to spend more time with me since she really likes me.

I tell her that she's fun. **Comfort tests**

**So. Many. Tests.**

I'm such a bad girlfriend - No you're not. You're just human.

I don't do this often - I know

Do you think I'm beautiful - I'm here, aren't I?

How am I? You fuck with the best.

How many women have you been with? - Today?

When was the last time you had sex?  You're not going to believe this but I'm actually a virgin. (I'm 34 with a kid).

Hungry, we grab a bite to eat. She tells me that she wants X but I give her Y instead since she's so into my frame. She starts to poke fun at the fact that I've got a gut now and I smile and tell her that I'm putting on weight to be a mall Santa. Honestly at this point, I don't care and have a post nut godhood clarity. 

 There are no complaints and I get another blowjob.

&#x200B;

When I drop her home she asks me to come in but we're not going to have any more sex. I tell her that as tempting as it sounds I'm going to head to work tomorrow so I'm going home but she can message me.

I get two texts about how she wanted me to stay and fuck her and how she's still horny and wants me to jerk off to her. I tell her sure and that's that.

&#x200B;

She's now in my rotation and since then I have discovered so many new red flags.

These flags include: Has fucked other guys recently, had a breakdown before, needs constant validation,  risky sexual behavior, loves BDSM.

So I'm going to keep her in my plate rotation. I don't expect it to last but will enjoy it while it does.

&#x200B;

Here's the take away and some of the things that I wish to share with some of the guys that are reading this.

Women at a young age are very sexual and open to hamster anything along. I didn't make her cheat but she chose to go along with it. If not with me definitely with some other guys. Women want to be lead and the fact that I wasn't aggressive at the start almost cost me that notch since she mistook my reservation with shyness (which to her is so offsetting) . Women have flags and it's easy to ignore them when you like them. I like her but only because I can bang her. Outside of that there's nothing really going on. The moment she slept with me, my friend instantly heard about it, she also knew details and everything. Women share sexual exploits. Watch what they do and not what they say.

Text for logistics. I could've cock blocked myself by being too available.  Even now she tries to call me and text me and believes that I've got other women on the side. I don't confirm or deny.

Create a path of least resistance towards a desired outcome. She knew she wanted my dick and I made it easy for her. Had I made it hard someone else would've done it.

You are the prize. Women come and go. I'm not going to lie, I'd like to keep this plate but I know that it's all temporary. Best to enjoy it and be happy that the next guy is going to enjoy what I teach her because I sure as shit enjoy her BJ game.

&#x200B;

857,fgq1yr,"TL;DR.. I wasn’t careful and allowed myself to get too attached, got maneuvered on, and I defeated myself.

So a few months ago, I inadvertently got involved with this super sexy, super cool nurse. By “inadvertently,” I mean it was just a Tinder fling that I let gradually evolve into more in my head. Not a relationship or anything, I just let myself get too attached by conceding a little ground at a time against my better judgement. Before I realized what had happened, I was already basically pining for her and her attention like a bitch. 

What really got her in was she was (barely) the hottest plate I had but I also liked her. She was super into me for the majority of time. She’d hang out, and when we weren’t together she would compliment me and respond right away and all that, even send me a nude or two as she was at the tanning salon or fresh out of the shower or whatever. 

Then suddenly she stopped replying all the time. Then she’d opt out of hanging out on our mutual days off. But it was so out of the blue and I really wasn’t all that familiar with her so I didn’t know what it was.

...Yeah I know. 

Then as I was re-listening to Rational Male at the gym today, I realized what was happening but I had already let myself get off frame. I contacted her first too many times with no response. I had let myself get too familiar and showed too much interest and bought into that gyno shit. 

And just like that I’m sitting at a bar feeling so ashamed. What the fuck was I thinking? Granted, I had just moved to a new city and didn’t know many girls, but really that’s no excuse, I should have accounted for it. 

And no I’m not a noob or anything, I’ve been RP for at least 10 years. Just a moment of weakness.

Anyways, just be careful. If you aren’t, sometimes this shit will sneak up on you. We all like to think that we’re mountains, but we’re naturally mountains made of little individual marbles and if you let people take a handful from you every time eventually you’ll be nothing.

&nbsp;


I haven't visited this forum in several years. There was a time when this place was at once a sanctuary and a well of knowledge for me. Today, I am occupied elsewhere, exploring new territory, breaking new ground, fighting more viscous demons. As a man always must do, as his nature requires of him.


&nbsp;


That is the first point to take away: You are here as part of your process of learning how to become a man. Your society has failed to teach you.  You may have been, or you might be going through a phase where you view this as a great curse, and so you curse the society that cursed you. With time you will recognize what a great blessing it is: an unimaginably glorious blessing. The best gift that any generation of men has been given so far!


&nbsp;


Anyway, I'm currently going through a process of looking through the last phase of my life to see what diamonds I left behind on my first run through. The first run through is always the messiest, the most feverish, you NEED TO GET OUT OF THE LABYRINTH!!! So you're not really paying attention as you sprint down its corridors.


&nbsp;


A quick glance at the current top post immediately gives me hope for the next generation. It almost saddens me to say that yes, I am that old. How did it happen? I'm not sure. You won't be either, trust me.


&nbsp;


When this whole thing was first getting going in the early 2000s (and its real roots can be traced as far back as the early newsgroups... maybe further?) we didn't have the internet of today. No youtube, no social media, no reddit, no self-help guru just one click away. But we had the internet, and that allowed us to finally thrive.


&nbsp;


We were the first generation who went through a fully conscious transition in relatively large numbers. We had each other, a handful of self-anointed gurus of the previous generation (and since they lacked the net almost entirely, their transition was incomplete more often than not) and that was it. The only other role models were men who had gone through the process mostly unconsciously. So they were of no use when it came to explanations. Certainly, they were of no use when it came to the application of the idea of going beyond your limits. The majority of them could scarcely be called men.


&nbsp;


When can a man say he has completed his transition into manhood? From some perspectives, there is no end to the transition. But a meaningful turning point is when a man recognizes how to tame his demons in order to use them to his benefit.


&nbsp;


That is what this whole thing is all about. Your demons within: your violent nature, your desire to conquer and possess, women most of all! When they are tamed and consciously utilized towards a meaningful progression, they make up the constituent parts of what we call a man.

Before puberty, a boy isn't even aware of these demons. He is innocent, feminine. He operates on a temporary personality structure given to him by his first caregiver(s); the one(s) who taught him to speak his first language, and served as his first model(s) for people. Typically, that means his mother.


&nbsp;


During puberty, his demons awaken. He starts to masturbate! And he is immediately shamed for it (or otherwise encouraged to do it as often as possible to porn. I'm not sure which is worse. To deny a singular demon power, or to give him absolute power over the entire personality?). One by one the demons awaken, in fits of rage and outbursts of violence. The boy begins to rebel against his world, and he doesn't even know why. One by one, the demons are negated, labeled as evil, and pushed back into the abyss of the boy's shadow. This does not end the boy's rebellion, nor the demons thirst for power. It merely turns it into a secret rebellion. What's worse, it scrambles the boys temporary personality structure: the one that has been sanctified by society as an ideal to be pursued!


&nbsp;


Here the boy faces a turning point. He can attempt to reconcile the conflict he feels, or otherwise narcotize himself in one way or another and pretend he doesn't feel it, and turn his boyish personality into a permanent one. Most of your peers will unfortunately go this route, our time is not yet. But don't despair... the first rays of light are about to burst across the horizon.


&nbsp;


What are the first rays of light? The fully conscious men of your generation. You are the first generation with the potential to make the transition in large enough numbers (and to be of a high enough quality) so that mankind can finally shine that motherfucking metaphorical light upon the world, that we have been pining for and claiming to have done, for the past 5,000 years!


&nbsp;


But as wonderful as your achievements may be. Oh, and btw, etch this into your fucking skulls: YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE BETTER THAN US! That means: more viscous, cruel, cunning, and lethal... but also... more loving, patient, brave, and wise. Loving? I thought that was a pussy thing? A man gives tough love to the world. What is tough love? Every time the universe, often in the guise of another man, gives you a stern kick in the ass. It's a reminder that Chaos is always just two steps away, and the only thing it wants is to KILL YOU! More: to obliterate you, to remove every trace of you, to eliminate any possibility of you (or others like you) of ever coming back!


&nbsp;


If that realization doesn't awaken the most supreme rage in you (maybe excitement, fascination, eagerness too?), consider that you may be well off the path...


&nbsp;


Anyway, as wonderful as your achievements may be, they will pale in comparison to the generation that comes after... Assuming you do your jobs well enough, are good enough at instructing them, and they do their jobs well enough... That generation may go down in history as the very first to represent something that resembles man's authentic potential.


&nbsp;


The mainstream declared the end of history in the 90s. How stupid and blind they are starts to become obvious when you realize that history hasn't even properly started yet! The generation after yours may represent the beginning of history!


&nbsp;


But I digress. Have I digressed within my digression? Are you paying attention?


&nbsp;


The second route, the one you have surely chosen--and if you have read this far, if you have felt your demons stirring throughout, if you have understood, or at least begun to understand, then you are almost certainly on the right path--is to tame the demons.


&nbsp;


How do you do that? Unfortunately, no one can be told what the matrix is, you have to see it for yourself.


&nbsp;


That means, everyone's process is radically different. Everyone has a different number of demons inside them, of varying types and intensities. Indeed, after you've tamed your first few demons, you will recognize that they weren't just fucking with your life, they were shielding you from another layer of even stronger, wilder demons.... The only way to learn how, is to rotely start doing the basic things you KNOW that you need to be doing. And then adjust as you go.


&nbsp;


Here are some general pointers off the top of my head:


&nbsp;


A man can become a man only by actively engaging with the real, physical world. Don't buy into any hippy-dippy, shangrhala, nirvana mystical nonsense. The real ""super powers"" (for fucks sake, how childish are some of our segments?) come later. And they're far, far beyond anything the wishful thinking morons fetishize. You can contact the dead, you say? Ooooh... scary.


&nbsp;


Masturbate when appropriate, refrain from any type of pornography. When you masturbate, visualize yourself dominating (dare I use an adverb before this word?) the women you wish to possess.


&nbsp;


You are the possessor of women, but remember, you also come from a woman, and women will also bare and raise your sons. Before you can dominate them, you must engage them with your wisdom. But only after you have dominated them (excluding your mother and kin, of course) should you engage them with your kindness.


&nbsp;


Any meditative technique that produces a dulling, narcotizing effect is never to be used as a regular practice. At best, it is a last resort type of tool, mostly used in the early phases. A way to calm yourself down in times when the demons threaten to overwhelm you... when you're just starting to tame them, they are wild beasts indeed.


&nbsp;


The wilder your demons, the more confusion, agitation, desire for revenge... and other such feelings.... you experience, the greater your overall potential. Don't despair. Don't allow your feelings to make you implode or explode. Hold out and continue the struggle. Yours will be the most difficult and longest, but your eventual success is also the most needful! (If you find yourself cracking and don't know what to do, please pm me.)


&nbsp;


Once you have tamed your first demon (he will typically come to be known as your charisma, your primary talent or skill) the most direct route to get all the rest, but also the riskiest route, is to bargain with your sex demon. Promise him his desires: women. Then allow him to take control. He will typically be more powerful than all the rest. But do not attempt to tame him first! That is the error of the so-called ""pick up artist"". (Anyone can ""pick up"" a woman, provided he has sufficient physical strength. But only a man with WILL can dominate and possess a woman... not to speak of multiple women!) That is the figure of Casanova, Hefner. Men who have made women an end in themselves... A dead end, to be sure (one shudders at the realization of what had once passed for a ""real"" man...). If you tame the sex demon first, he will want to rule (as is the nature of all demons), and he will not allow you to tame any others. You will have no way of preventing this, unless you have tamed at least one, or preferably several other demons first.


&nbsp;


If you are Christian and unable to let go of your belief (it has been drilled into you too deeply, it's too much a part of you), you MUST turn Christ into a bad ass! Remember, he came with the sword. A man cannot love his enemy. That is the trap in Christianity. Not everyone is equal. Not everyone has equal potential. Some people want to kill you, and will never relent. It's your job to... I censor myself before the censors can censor me.


&nbsp;


Dispense with all notions of a quick fix solution. If you find yourself using too many cheesy platitudes, you are on a fake feminine road, designed to trap you. Women have a tendency to over complicate and oversimplify the world in one stroke. This automatically eliminates all mainstream self-help seminars, spiritual retreats, and other such bullshit. The road you must travel is simple and brutal. It also necessarily a solitary one. Any formation of groups promising such a transition are a trap or a lie. The only necessary questions: where is the enemy? How do I defeat him? No platitude can answer these for you.


&nbsp;


If you start feeling a sense of false pride (if you start thinking that you're somehow better than the average guy just because you read a message board and he doesn't... as an example...), you can be sure you are well off the path and soundly nestled between the squishy warm bodies of the herd. A man does not wear his pride on his sleeve. He reserves it as his most prized possession! And thus one he saves exclusively for himself, or in the rare cases, a select few he deems worthy of the gift.


&nbsp;


Don't buy into any bullshit, one size fits all, diet program, all the carnivore diets included. Listen to your body, feed it what it desires, stick to wholesome food (meat, fish, whole grain, green vegetables etc.). Children eat candy and random bullshit. You're becoming a man, start eating like one. (Learn to cook!)


&nbsp;


Eat quickly. Scarf your food down. Eat on the go. A man does not kill so he can eat. He kills so his women and sons may eat. He eats so that he can kill.


&nbsp;


Pleasure is only worthwhile as a celebration (not a reward, a man does not manipulate himself!) of a difficult overcoming, a conquest.


&nbsp;

I believe that generation Z is, overall, shaping out to be the most aware recent generation.

Recently, the concept of ""[simps/simping](https://metro.co.uk/2020/01/04/what-is-simping-and-what-is-a-simp-12001620/)"" as a derogatory term has been popularised online. While it's hyperbolic, it is easy to see similarities with sidebar material. 

From the linked article, a simp: 

* Puts females before themselves. 
* Will quickly defend a female
* Has no game when coming to females so they only try to impress them by doing everything for them and lets females walk over them.

These align with the following fundamental principles:

* Listen to Patrice O'Neal (RIP) on prioritising ""[himself, his career, his mother, and then her](https://youtu.be/PWcMqM9_kbs?t=204)""
* The ""simp"" defends a woman in an attempt to appeal to her as a beta protector
* This is pretty explicit, the ""simp"" lacks game and loses frame easily 

Enter Felix ""PewDiePie"" Kjellberg. He's a Swedish YouTuber, who began playing games and moved to comedic formatted shows. As the [most subscribed non-company YouTuber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-subscribed_YouTube_channels), he's under intense scrutiny from mainstream media who describe him as ""[flirting with alt-right culture](https://www.vox.com/2018/12/13/18136253/pewdiepie-vs-tseries-links-to-white-supremacist-alt-right-redpill)"" so he walks a tightrope when producing content. 

Today, he uploaded a video titled ""[NEVER call me a SIMP!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJMQjF6I4Bw)"", about the recent meme. The video is tongue in cheek targeted at a gen Z audience and will likely reach over five million viewers over the next few days. I am not suggesting that PewDiePie is aware of/alludes to TRP, however, of those five million, a small portion may reflect on their current sexual strategy and will search for an alternative. This isn't the first time PewDiePie ""redpilled zoomers"", such as outside of intergender relations when he [pulled out of an ADL donation](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/09/13/entertainment/pewdiepie-donation-adl-trnd/index.html). 

Overall, the accessibility of the ""simp"" meme and its further spread by figureheads like PewDiePie is an example of why I believe that the next generation of men will stray from traditional intergender ideals.",859,2.0,0.37369999289512634,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck"
860,ffrbwd,"# TLDR:

The advantage of looks, or muscular fitness, for men is the number one rule here and that's the only philosophy *unique to TRP* and pretty foolproof.

# Too Long but Read:

I have been a lurker of the manosphere for more than 15 years and TRP for maybe 4. With regards to PUA, I never put the 'cold approach', 'peacocking' and all that shit to use because of my cultural/social setting and also because I was too busy working, reading *occult* and psychological stuff, and other activities. The principles of TRP were a big shocker compared to the PUA stuff I was used to.

The idea that women don't need to be 'seduced' but that they will literally give up everything if they find an 'alpha'; the idea that women will easily give sex without much investment from a man as long as he games well; the idea that men are the gatekeepers of commitment, women of sex, and *not* the other way around (believe me, movies actually make us feel that men who say 'no' to sex from girl A are actually attractive to girl B because they rejected or weren't interested in girl A); these are all harkening to the innate, primal mentality of humans (regardless of gender). Only TRP had the guts to talk about these things, and is paying the price for it through the Reddit quarantine.

*However*, the reason why many women and even men hate or disagree with the teachings here is not just because they feel these principles are effective, but also because there are convincing evidences of all of these principles not being healthy or even effective in sexual strategy.

**Yet, the importance of lifting weights to develop musculature and strength is the only TRP idea that** ***cannot*** **be refuted and is pretty effective in preparing a man** ***to be a man*****.**

Yes, there are ugly men who have gotten laid and there skinny men who have gotten laid. But they had something else going on for them—personal charisma, some fame, a skill that had a following, etc. But if a sexual strategy had to be provided for a loser with women, lifting weights is the only guaranteed way for him to feel good about himself, arouse primal desire in women, reclaim his place as a man among men, and claim default state of approval or respect in any social or professional setting. *Just muscles* isn't always going to get him laid, but it will give him more than what the other ideas of TRP will.

All other traits or skillsets are either:

1. effective but time-consuming and go against Nature with regards to the lack of physical fitness (like a famous writer or musician getting laid just because women love them for their work, not their body—this is important because viscerally we actually have sex with a good *body*, not mind)
2. effective but difficult and also need continuous upkeep (like developing mental confidence while still having a bad body)
3. effective only in particular situations with particular kind of people while actually backfiring in other situations and with other people (like a really straightforward or brutally honest mannerism)

*Yet, go to the gym, lift heavy weights, feel strong, become strong, and just like that you become attractive to women, respectable to men and live longer to fuck longer.*

# About me

As an average Indian male living in India, I measure 5 ft 5 in and am an ectomorph. In my mid 20s, I weighed *45 kg*. Just imagine how fucking thin that was. After 4 years of 3 day split (which I *do not* recommend) and 2.5 years of 3 day whole-body compound workouts (I refuse to go to the gym more than 3 days a week because I got other shit to do, and I love Greyskull LP), I weigh *65 kg*. No supplements, unhealthy sleep patterns, but I still *love* what gymming has done to me. I always was facially good looking, but I held a girl's hand for the first time when I was 25 and lost my virginity only when was 30. Now in my mid-30s I only fuck 18–22 yr olds whenever they come my way. Why and how? That's too long to explain (and I won't in the future too), but this post is my one advice to men—

[https://www.city-journal.org/europe-multiculturalism](https://www.city-journal.org/europe-multiculturalism)

I did not realize the situation in Sweden and other parts of Europe was in fact this bad, honestly. It looks like for all the talk of fempowerment (and today being women's day in fact), feminised societies for all their claims of egalitarian utopia (dystopia?) have failed in keeping their women strong and safe. It's gotten so bad they've coined a word 'rapefugees' for it.

At the root of this is a culture of open hypergamy that masculinizes girls, betaizes and then frustrates the boys and men, plus then opening one's borders to all and sundry in the name of immigration, without even a background check. While the men and white knights support the same as they will get access to cheap labor to replace an increasingly ageing demographic reluctant to reproduce.

If you've been paying attention to politics, you'll soon realize that once women enter politics, left vs right wing increasingly becomes more of a gender war than anything else, with women leaning more to the left and men leaning more to the right (the white knights though will always lean with the women). Whatever conservatives and liberals stood for in the past, all that is increasingly being steamrolled by gender differences and large scale macroscopic displays of sexual behavior at the political level.

The politics of the USA at this moment is essentially one big gender war - the rape accusation now the latest power play. The politics of a country like India is also turning into a right vs left gender war, especially if you look at the real power centers between the 2 biggest parties. Other countries are either more masculine or more feminine - the politics of China and Russia is masculine, but the politics of Europe is now unabashedly feminine, and Sweden is the feminist capital of the world. The politics during the World Wars and the Cold War was totally masculine in comparison.

This is a clear proof of the fact that no matter at what level, the reality of the physical biological and psychological differences between men and women can never really be ignored and comes out in actual behavior no matter what politicians want you to believe. **Deep in the subconscious, the differences between men and women influence their behaviors -- even and especially in large scale politics.**

I have studied the behavior of many female politicians, and I find that all governments headed by females or having a significant majority of females in power tend to behave similarly. Often heading to some version of welfare state where the government plays daddy in place of hopeless beta men, and pro immigration to the extent of causing serious demographic shifts. Birth rates are also low, so population average age keeps rising. With more elderly to take care of, welfare becomes even more important, and it becomes a kind of positive feedback.

So what happened in Sweden or Germany and other European countries? A large scale version of betaization basically. In betaization, the woman falls in love with a masculine man, gradually converts him down to a provider, in the process losing attraction for a domesticated housecat that was once a free wild lion, and then gets attracted to the next man that exudes unrestricted and untamed masculine energy and loses loyalty for her own man.

Betaization is closely linked to the rubber band like hypergamous attraction of the feminine for men that are farther away, require greater effort to pursue and are more of a challenge. The attraction to the affair partner exists because the husband has become too familiar, too beta, too easy and not worth pursuing anymore.

How does this script play out in international politics? Exactly the same.  First the women over a period of generations, starting from school, by taking over the educational system, betaized all their own men and boys, and tried making women more masculine. Then when they no longer found the masculine energy in their country worth it, and indigenous birth rates began to slow, they opened their borders to immigration, and not just for cheap labor.

In the process they really let in a lot of 'bad boys' into their country, didn't they? How often do we see women politicians and the media rationalizing or hiding away the evidence of the things they don't want you to hear? Well, guess which nations aren't so safe now as they were before. France, Sweden, even Germany, Holland, you name it. Take a look at the politicians on board these governments.

This process happens subconsciously and too subtly over a long period of time until you look back and connect the dots. I don't think anyone in this process is even aware that this is what are doing, but their instincts drive them on.

And btw who specifically did they encourage more than anyone else in Europe? At least as per the media and social media stories going around?

Muslims. Yes. From Muslim majority and dominated nations. The immigrants into France, Sweden, Germany and even the US (till they got tough on it) were mostly from Muslim war torn nations, from Afghanistan to Somalia even.

Your media is the ideal feminine space. Google up Yellow Journalism and see the characteristics for yourself. By the way, their favourite word these days is dissent, aka disagreement. And they are for some reason very obsessed with supporting Muslims. The overall support in left leaning media for Islam is a huge outlier, with a lot of women leading the way. I've never quite understood just why for a long time (until now) - after 9/11, there was a huge rush in sections of the media to defend it. It's as biased as it gets.

When it comes to underdogs, the tendency of the media is to show that one exceptional case while denying the reality of all the other cases that failed and backfired, badly, and a complete handwaving of macroscopic statistical behavior. You will never, ever see the governments admit or take responsibility for their failures. Sounds pretty much like what a female mind would do right?

Why do the governments and the media do this? Is it a religious thing? Nope, this is all about masculinity.

I observe that Islam is a totally patriarchal religion - I've read almost all major religious books, so I know what each of them talk about. The culture itself is masculine dominant in nature. And their track record of treating their own women in their countries even to this day, as well as the women of all the countries they invaded in the middle ages is well known. If you do a simple search on google, and check out some of the laws and punishments or the history, you'll come face to face what would be actual Dark Triad behavior, the extreme militant variants of which made even Navy Seals sweat. In fact if I wrote this post from some Islamic countries, by now I'd have been executed, horribly.

For all that these women leaders claim, and they would furiously deny this if confronted, subconsciously they're seeking a lot of raw untamed masculine energy that they've never obtained from their own, domesticated breed of betaized boys and absent men. Why not invite in the more masculine patriarchal breed of men who push a rigid, patriarchal religion, who in theory could dominate them with hard power and testosterone? So what if they're apparently known for being ""bad boys""? They can rationalize that away and shame the rest of the world for not being altruistic. Later on this can also serve as a good vote bank. Women's subconscious instincts are still in the stone age, where being raw, wild and more savage was what helped you win and survive against predators and other enemies.

The immigrants who often come from countries fraught with years of war, hardship and unending conflict would of course be more raw and brutish by temperament compared to the extremely politically correct, afraid to offend culture of Europe. Somehow it is exactly these people that the feminine leaders of Europe want to welcome in with open doors.

This has sometimes gone to the next level. Why do you think so many women from Europe and the US even became ISIS brides and then the media on top of that supports them as well? Why not get drawn to the baddest boys whose track record of insurgency, holy war and terrorism, and treating women abusively, far surpasses every other group on the planet, barring maybe the Nazis or the Europeans who conquered the Americas? I guess these women like men who are passionate fighters just because they exude raw energy, but the discrimination of their base instincts stops at that and doesn't consider for one second that they're terrorists and not heroes. Later on they can always play the victim card and get the beta providers and white knights to offer them asylum.

**All this is a case of the classic women being drawn to the bad, raw masculine boys at a macroscopic level, even to the point of Dark Triad territory. But this is not just an individual person - it is a whole country acting on a feminine behavioral pattern without realizing it. The immigration move is basically an entire nation committing hypergamy.**

**The feminized media won't admit it, but they also subconsciously love the bad boys**

I'm not sure if these women and feminist governments even recognize that this is what their subconscious hive minds are doing. If confronted, their logical brains fed on feminist ideology would furiously deny and shame you for saying it even, their own cognitive dissonance would be too much to handle, but their bodies are driving them on what I call hypergamy on an international scale. Curse the evil patriarchy, but open your country to them? Look at what they do, not what they say.

This will sound utterly insane at first. How can sexual energy influence at that scale you ask? Aren't they just being nice and humanitarian? That's what they and we all believe. But just as left vs right is becoming a gender war and not at all subtle about it, so is the rest of politics. **There is no escaping biology, at any level of existence.**

This is what I call ultra large scale, macroscopic sexual patterns of behavior.

But as these women find out, being in abusive relationships with jerks isn't fun but traumatic. It was attractive when they could admire the jerks from afar and have an idealized concept of that person (which is what they actually fall in love with), but when you close the distance, reality ensues. As it did in Sweden and Europe, as it did to the ISIS brides as well. Even then I doubt if women would truly wake up from their self destructive tendencies without a hard boundary as they would rather have moments of intense emotion (even if toxic) rather than the blandness of their own domesticated men. IMHO when your mind is out of control, it's an addiction, plain and simple.

And why do the men alongside these women in power support it? For one, those men aren't really in power, certainly the masculine paradigm isn't at all in power. They presume they'll get cheap labor from the developing world, as the only thing corporates care about is money aka keeping costs low. Paying their own provider men would be too expensive. Plus their own feminist population is not enthusiastic about reproducing, so the population pyramid is growing old in all first world countries - welfare is going to become a nightmare in the future. This culture combined with hypergamy makes a bad combination. Aim for cheap, and you get not just cheap labour, but cheap everything. The very standards of your society are turning cheap. Provider beta men are dumped by the women at one end and their bosses at the other. Who cares?

Now before you accuse me as ""Islamaphobic"" or ""anti immigration"" (a common shaming tactic btw, a lot of women in the media dissed the author of a best selling book on Islam's truths as full of hate, without actually discussing the content itself -- the irony), I should tell you that I don't hate on anyone with a prejudiced xenophobic and irrational mind like some immature child, but I just look at actual behavior and macroscopic stats and behavioral patterns, being the man I am. I even have friends across a wide variety of communities, but despite that I recognize that tension can become palpable over gender, politics and religion. Exceptions to the trends for me are just that, exceptions, not vindication. 

The stats of terror attacks all over the world in the last 2 decades since 9/11 and even before that the track record of hundreds of years of conquest would ought to tell you who has exerted, and who still goes by masculine ""hard power"" way of things. You can take a look at which countries have pretty brutal dark triad laws even today. Right now it is Muslims that can outbreed any other community on earth given their patriarchal polygamous policies.

In all other countries, especially in Europe, native birth rates are slowing down and even going into negative territory and this is a direct consequence of feminism. The hypergamic feminized nations are really at risk of demographic implosion and immigration only further skews the demographic percentages. The very reason why America voted for Trump over everything else is because the masculine has reached a point where it is fed up of this self betaizing, foreign dick seeking feminine behavior. Regardless of how hard the media tries to convince and feed you the narrative, the world is swinging to the right (and to an extent, the masculine and the conservative) again. Brexit is just the latest example. With good reason.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50339977](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50339977)

The rest of the media is on a campaign to DEER it all away, especially on Google. They don't want you to know.

And what about the beta local boys in Sweden and the other countries? I am waiting for that article that will claim they are responsible for a significant fraction of these crimes in Sweden, not the immigrants! Sexually frustrated beta men are a danger to the long term stability of society as well as women as they can end up revolting and doing all sorts of shit to women due to sexual frustration and being unable to handle rejection and their own pent up inner rage, characteristic of Nice Guy behavior. Plus the ones who are actually mentally ill and predisposed to violence.

This is where RP benefits women too, as men who own their shit and have abundance and outcome independence wouldn't behave in such rage or desperation.

So betaization, immigration and raw, seemingly attractive bad boys from outside vs frustrated unattractive betas at home -- the time tested feminine sexual strategy of hypergamy working out at the level of international politics explains how despite all the talk of feminine empowerment, Sweden and other European feminist nations aren't really safe for women as they claim.

As females cause families and societies to implode into hypergamy induced instability, the same is even true at the international level. There is no escaping our physical differences.

To be fair to the feminine mind, let's look at the WW2 period, when IMHO masculine politics peaked. Masculine nations are strongly patriotic, sovereignty is a big deal, the internal cohesion of the tribe or country is paramount, the society and culture has hard boundaries, those seen as traitors are punished and these nations actively try to compete, conquer and win. All what we call ""old school"" - observe that these qualities are not valued in liberal, feminized countries. The result of hyper masculinity in politics can backfire when taken to extremes, as masculine nations essentially die as a result of excessive warfare.

Japan is a good example of how cruel and ruthless they once were during the imperial days. That ended with the Atom Bomb. That I believe was the turning point. Then everyone got scared and feared that hyper masculinity left unchecked would blow up the whole world. Unfortunately the opposite of crazy is still crazy, so Japan now has gone to the extreme other end now, with workaholic betaized herbivore men and a declining population and economy.

Scandinavia was once Viking land, would you even believe it now? 

So hyper masculine societies become too ruthless and aggressive and literally explode their way to death. Hyper feminine societies become too unstable and implode their way to death. **Masculine nations explode, feminine nations implode.**

My problem is not immigration or women or that I am some masculinist supremacist whatever BS -- I'm just pointing out how societies can be imbalanced when the pendulum swings too far to either the masculine or the feminine. The problem is that any ideology, any left or right paradigm when taken to an excess will lead to imbalance and cause severe problems down the road. Heck, even food in excess will kill your health and life.

For most of human history, we witnessed hyper masculinity in politics. Ever since democracy came along, and the masses gained power, politics has increasingly gone down a feminized slope, because that's how feminine minds work. But right now, that pendulum is swinging far too much to the feminine. We're witnessing the global version of hyper feminine craziness which will led to a different kind of massive decline now.

Masculine politics essentially peaked during WW2 when it was taken to psycopathic extremes of genocide. Since then politics has steadily and surely become more and more feminized, and now the pendulum is beginning to swing to the other extreme end. This is not good either, because an overly feminine society will implode into instability and will subconsciously behave in a way that allows itself to be taken over.

In all the articles talking about the result of immigration into Europe, if you go down to the comments section below, the comments clearly reveal the average reader is fully aware of what is going on (they haven't seen it in a gender based frame), and they have already seen where their society's heading for at this rate.

It's up to men to step up and reclaim their masculinity, and enforce standards and boundaries, or allow their society to be taken over down the road by a stronger tribe where masculinity is still valued. Well, if that sounds too much to you, I should just let you know that this has been how men always went about doing it throughout history. It is just this generation of men that would rather be society's victim than the creators of societies and nations.

I have to agree with Freud for once when he claimed all energy was sexual. Politics is the best example of macroscopic sexual behavior. **Masculine societies behave like virtual penises, feminine ones like virtual vaginas.**

*PS : Also, I observe a curious trend with TRP posts - that they first get downvoted and the vote count stays down for quite a while before the main readership begins to upvote the numbers. That gives me an idea of what kind of audience lurks around here. Other reddit users see this in their feeds, but eventually after a few hours it goes down and disappears due to endless posts from other subreddits, so they forget about it. The readership here however gets to see this up on front page for a few days at least.*

*EDIT 2 : Before some guys come here and call me racist or xenophobic or some other thing. I personally wouldn't mind immigration, but in this case the results of a strategy speak for themselves. All strategies don't work all time. In WW1 and WW2, the USA was a boon to those who wanted to escape from Russia or the Nazis. This wasn't the same result. This was one case where feminized Europe just went too far. A solution's effectiveness is known by the results -- whatever people feel or think.*",861,4.0,0.5121999979019165,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
862,fedgmy,"Been about four or five months since I last read any Redpill content, and About 10 months since I posted anything Redpill related, and I’m happy to report that my game has returned to a level where I have supreme confidence every time I go on a date, enter a club or talk to a woman. Not what most people here say, right?
So often I read accounts of people who gave up their Red Pill journey and returned to their comfortable Blue Pilled ways, only to get walked all over by a woman who was previously begging for their cock, challenged by men who previously paid them the utmost respect, and insulted by randomers who sense weakness in their demeanour. 


I admit, these accounts scared me, and I was extremely hesitant to stop studying the RedPill lest I become a blue balled, beta pussy. But at the same time, I looked at my track record since adopting the Red Pill, and I noticed that it was extremely poor compared to the results I had gotten in all the single years I had previous. “But this can’t be” I thought, “the Redpill is supposed to improve everything about your game and give you an advantage over the average guy, what am I doing wrong?”. So after I had a series of embarrassing failures with women, where I essentially had them eating out of my hand only to say something profoundly stupid (usually in response to a perceived ‘shit test’) and ruin any chance I had with them in mere seconds, I decided to take a break from the Redpill. I chilled the fuck out on the overthinking prompted by the Redpills examination of the social interaction between genders, stopped reading all Redpill readings and just did the things that matter. Focused on college work, made going to the gym five days a week with my mates a priority and just started going out on nights out without an agenda to pull women. After four or five months of this, I found that I was no longer turning to Redpill teachings to augment my every action with women, and my game had returned to the way it was when I started, although it was admittedly better as I had matured overall as a person in the time I was doing Redpill stuff. 


I was no longer a complete fucking asshole, insulting women when I could, or brushing them off to make them work harder or qualify themselves. Instead I was walking around happy, sometimes acting cheeky towards them and offering minor challenges, but nothing that couldn’t be construed as just a bit of fun. The hostility was gone, the insecurity and pressure of acting like an alpha was gone, and (particularly on dates) my words just flowed and seemed to hit their mark more often than not. I had unintentionally built up a roster of women who want to date me, but understand that I’m not available right now because my Final Year in College was keeping me busy. But nonetheless, the harem I so desperately sought in my hardcore Redpill regurgitation days, was now developing organically, with all of them available to hit up whenever I felt like it.

To anyone who read the title and assumed I was a Redpill hater, I want you to know that that isn’t the case. In fact, I do believe there is a lot of good to be learned from the Redpill, going to the gym religiously, not being too sympathetic to women, not allowing them to be the focus of your success but rather the byproduct, recognition of the power you hold as a man and how to embrace your masculinity without becoming a toxic hostile cunt, looksmaxxing etc. 


However, there is a lot of room for misinterpretation in the words we read here. Many believe everything they read here to be fact, and that goes for both the Big dogs like Rollo and Vasily to any random Reddit comment who’s author may or may not have any fucking clue what they’re talking about. 
This can lead you to begin reconstructing the way you think in the wrong way, and if your foundation is off, everything is off.
In my case, I wasn’t exactly struggling with women before the Redpill, I’m was considered good looking by others and I spoke well even if I was a bit of a nice guy at times whose backbone disappeared when challenged. So I turned to the Redpill to improve my game, thinking it would bring me to the next level. 
But as is so often the case, I went from one extreme to the other, and when I thought I was Redpilled, what I actually was was an aggressive, overly sensitive, condescending douchebag who overthought every single interaction. So a break melted away a lot of that hostility and the really important stuff I learned from the Redpill remained. 


I can now say that I am at my peak in basically every regard, I am just fucking loving life at the moment. Not just with women or work, but everything. And the Redpill played a key part in the journey. While I will probably never be the kind of guy who frantically digests every bit of Redpill knowledge I come across (because for me, that just wasn’t working), I will no doubt pop in to remind myself of certain things every now and again.

**TL;dr Motivational Reflection Post About The Gym**

Wanted to make this post because the girl at my gym reception told me it was my 2nd year anniversary at the gym and it made me reflect a little.   


Not really a story about how I was a skinny little kid who got bullied in highschool and now gets all the pussy, just some man thoughts.

# Fall in love with your approval

I knew this guy a few years ago who wanted to join the gym and get big. On a drunk night he told me he saw how his girl would change her demeanor around ripped guys and he hated them for it. Soon after he said this she left him for a much better guy. This apparently ""pushed him over the edge"" and he joined the same University gym as me around the same time. He came in saying he wanted to look like Brad Pitt from the fight club.

I saw him the first couple of week, 4 days a week. Super motivated. Then he said he had cramps and I saw him twice a week. Then once a week because his “schedule is so full bro”. He had a few sporadic bursts of energy and he quit officially after a couple of months. Around the time he got a girlfriend who he knew was fucking other dudes but that's another story.   


His story taught me a valuable lesson. I realised when something drastic happens that exposes our weaknesses, we have a sudden motivation to change it. Whether it being your unicorn leaving you or your friends having more money or anything. The guy came in wanting to change himself not for himself but because of things around him.

From him I learned that whenever I want to achieve something greater than myself to first realise that I'm not shit. This will give me the solid platform to build from. And then from there set small defined goals and crush them with honesty. This will eventually snowball into something greater.   


Seek approval of yours only because the mirror cannot judge you, you judge what's in the mirror. But 99% of us can't do this which is why we turn 40 driving our ugly wife and 3 stupid kids around the city in a station wagon.

# Fall in love with your failures

I ""relapsed"" from the gym many times. Once it was because of ""stress"" from my part time job, another because I lost my parttime job and was broke and another because of exams. Each day I was depressed because I couldn't believe I wasn't making progress in some way.   


But each time I came back and I fell in love with the weights again. Last time after my gym break, I remember not being able to even bench my weight. But I remember me putting it back on the rack and being excited like a kid again. It was something to work towards again. I was focused.   


Even though something small, I remember having the extra step in the gym because I had a purpose. I learned that even though this was a small failure, falling in love with the come back is what truly matters.  


# Fall in love with the process

When I first started I had no idea how much of my life would have to be restructed to accomodate lifting. As I said, gym was just somewhere to relieve stress and skip classes in. But after a month, I fell in love with waking up at 5AM to make my pre-workout coffee. I fell in love with catching the bus before the sun was up. I fell in love listening to music as I was commuting to the gym. I fell in love with going into the cornerstore after I got out of the bus to buy my energy drink. I fell in love with sweaty smell of the lockers as I changed out of my fatigues. I fell in love with filling my bottle and making my whey shake after the workout.   


Making way for this whole process forced me to quit waking up and smoking weed, so that I can find the best porn that I can jerk off to. It forced me to have more discipline. It forced me to force myself into becoming better.   


And the best part of it is that none of it feels like work. Gym wasn't just lifting weights for me, it was the whole journey to it. The lifting is only the 1 hour, the time before and after is what I really love. From this I learned to always fall in love with the process. It could be the smallest of things, but if you truly enjoy it then the rewards would just be the secondary goal.

# Summary

* Seek your own validation. Don't do anything because you want to compete with others. It won't ever last.  

* Failures help your find your purpose. You learn what you did wrong and don't do it again. It will also help you push yourself harder.  

* Enjoy the process. It will make work feel like pleasure.

864,ferudg,"SUMMARY: Demonstrating high value is not the end all to mitigate hypergamy. Unique value will make her think you are the only one in the world, and this will cause her to think twice before acting on her hypergamic urges because the stakes are higher. However, demonstrating unique value may involve some levels of emotional connection whether feigned or genuine. Unique value will cause you to stand out and it will be harder for her to calculate the value of other men because you showcase yourself to be extremely unique in her subjective reality.

&#x200B;

# Problem Of Fungibility

I first outline the Problem of Fungibility. In its simplest terms, if A is better than B, and we can get B, as humans, we would replace A with B without hesitation. Social theorists will argue this applies to friendships as well, but that is not the focus of this post.

In Redpill Literature, the doctrine is to improve yourself and demonstrate higher value such that she will want you. However, I think more than higher value, we should examine how we can demonstrate unique and/or unique higher value. This is because as much as we improve ourselves, if we do not demonstrate how we are unique, you are essentially the exact same redpilled guy out there, and any other redder pilled guy will steal your bitch. Hence the saying, your turn never yours. Furthermore, when you stay in any relationship for long periods of time, her subjective lenses will eventually get bored, and your once high value becomes ordinary and she might stop appreciating your once high value when she sees past the initial excitement and her hypergamic urges are activated (e.g being a football player, having cash, etc etc because these are not sufficiently unique).

# Unique Value

What then is Unique Value? Unique value is hard to underpin, but it is something that makes you different from other guys. It is something that gives her oneitis.

This might edge onto bluepill, but I think some aspects of bluepill tools can be used to achieve redpill goals (or purple pill if you would like).  It is something that makes her feel that you have seen her in a way that no one else does. It is letting her  expose her vulnerabilities while you comfort her.

It is the holding of as many micro frames as you can within the macro frame of the alpha chad. To be stoic is boring. You wanna be stoic and fun at the same time. Now that is somewhat unique. To be dead serious on your goals, but also someone who can let loose. To be intellectual, but adventurous. You get the idea. The more micro frames, the more nuanced you are as an individual. Stop being boring.

But even then, these are only external frames. What you want is to speak to her internally. What do I mean by this?

A powerful tool I have discovered unwittingly, is to really understand her and her past traumas which have shaped her for who she is. I think it is common consensus that quite a fair amount of girls are neurotic/crazy, but this is not fault of theirs. Many of them have had traumatic experiences which causes them to act the way they do without them even realizing.

If you can unpack her trauma for her, explain how that experience has shaped her current beliefs, and release her emotional distress for the very first time, she will see you as a God and you have cemented your status as the best man she can get because her subjective hypergamic calculations will think you really are the best (even if it might not be the case in objective reality but it doesnt matter because she is in your frame). She will think no one else will ever be able to understand her for who she is in the way you do and she will cling on tightly. Following which, she is less likely to act on her hypergamic urges, but this does not mean you stop self-improving, because AWALT. (Right guy comes along and she might think his cock is worth more than this connection. But the point is that this connection acts as a buffer and makes her realise the stakes are higher if she cheats because she will lose you.) Owing to scope of this post, I cannot explain easily how exactly you unpack trauma and reframe her beliefs and explain herself to her, and I can already forsee people labelling this as being an emotional tampon (which it sort of is except you are doing it in the right way that makes her get even more tingles).

What is most important is to forge a real connection with the connection of selves. Game is necessary, but I think game is not substantial and is only useful for short term fuckboi mating strategies. That said, reserve this for FWBs or an LTR that is worthy. And for the love of God, never give away your LTR commitment too easily.

# Final Notes and Word of Caution

If it isn't obvious, please be selective who you do this to. If she truly is extremely psycho, it might not be worth trying to show her the light because it will be too difficult and she might cling on overly tightly to you. The broad idea is to connect on something substantial that makes her feel like her existence means something in a way she has never felt before.

As a critique of the redpill, I think a consequent of truly internalising abundance will mean that it becomes extremely hard to forge connections and this becomes even harder when you understand the nature of hypergamy. I think it is possible to accommodate some emotional connections within the sphere of the redpill without turning into a complete beta.

This is essentially also mastery of the Rollo's conception of the nice guy-asshole spectrum. Too asshole and too alpha and you'll only fuck her but she wouldn't want something else from you. It might even be difficult to spin her as a plate. True mastery of the niceguy-asshole spectrum is the way to go such that she willingly accepts her status of a plate as she wishes to ascend the ranks. From here, you decide what you want to achieve. This is just a tool, the goal is determined by you.

To be clear, this is done with the general frame of being Alpha. This teaches the aspect of being tender in the correct way. Women ultimately want a man who is both alpha and beta simultaneously, and this is ultimately unique. ",864,2.0,0.34299999475479126,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck"

My friend is married with two very young children. He is a textbook extrovert. He had an active bachelor life, never a problem getting women. He wasn't RP, he just did MANY RP things without realizing it. He has an almost magical ability to get people to follow him and subscribe to his ideas. He lies very easily and convincingly. He has the dark triad down pat. Since childhood, he has created a number of memes (Dawkins definition, not internet definition) within our friends group that stuck for months. On top of that, he rakes in a comfortable six-figure salary in the finance field.

But the curious thing about this man, who I consider a brother, is that he's never wanted to be a leader. The thought turns him off. And he has always gone for women he could be submissive with. ""Alpha in the streets, beta in the sheets,"" doesn't quite describe it. More like beta in the house as soon as he steps through the door.

His wife comes from money. Big family, not divorced. She is, for the purpose of this discussion, otherwise a typical woman. A little more neurotic than most, but typical nonetheless. She took a high turnover job that she was doing when they met. She stopped doing that job because it was ""stressful"" (and really it is, but c'mon, could you imagine quitting), and stayed home to take care of the kids. But her quitting predates the pregnancy.

____

Lat year my friend had a tragedy in his family, the kind that will weaken any man. Most women will allow you to be weak for 1, maybe 2 days. But in him this persisted. And eventually he displayed the **ultimate form of weakness**: he considered suicide. Even worse, he told her. 

So she did what women do and dragged him to a couples therapist where most of the time was spent with her berating and ""venting"" about him. And, he tells me, they would always come back from therapy seemingly worse than when they began. This is a stereotype that I think we've heard about  a lot. I was very disheartened to see it play out so clearly, so close to home. And I'm not even kidding, you could have scripted it. Really saddening stuff.

So of course she did what any woman does when she sees her man hit rock bottom for a prolonged period of time. She supported him throughout in a very nurturing way and built him back up. 

Ha. Come on. 

No, she kicked him out. He is now simply waiting for the other shoe to drop. 

___

So what I'm seeing is possession on both sides. She is the one making all the decisions and she has simply switched off to him. There is no getting through to her. She has somehow turned his thoughts of self harm against him and made it about her. You know what I'm talking about. When a girl gets to that point, becomes that brick wall. She becomes a stranger. It's a terrifying thing to go through if you've never seen it before. That's her animus possession.

And he, he is reduced to begging. He wants to ""fight"" for her. He is purely following his emotions. He is talking too much. He is a shadow of who he was, taking a one-two punch of his family tragedy early, and now this new tragedy. His anima is in charge.

___

Underlying this is a jarring reality: I have looked up to this man my whole life. I have mimicked and copied some of the things he does as an example, with some really good success. This is a guy who has made the right moves since day 1. While I was fucking around with my head in the clouds, making mistake after mistake, he always -almost naturally- knew the right thing to do.

Now I am worried about him. I am worried about losing my brother. And he has already been seeing therapists all year, both on his own and the couple. I think I might be the only one on his side, because I know that despite all his genius he has never been here before and doesn't know what to do. And that's why he is making the wrong moves. If I didn't now what I know, my reaction would also be to distance myself because no one likes a downer. But I know everyone else is doing that. 

After the shoe does drop, I'm going to try to guide him correctly. But I've only ever rescued myself from the anima before. It took months, almost a year. I just need him to not fucking kill himself.",865,4.0,0.4447000026702881,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

# The good and bad news are the same— it works.

I've always been a bell curve kind of dude. Average height, dick, not autistic, not ultra funny, a 'good friend', invisible to some, etc. I had '*girlfriends*' in secondary school but didn't get laid until my 21st birthday.

Luckily I intuited the value of monk mode long before I found trp. A lot of us do, the idea has a certain self-evident truth to it. Frustrated and misinformed, I gave up on chicks from 21-26, but crucially not on my life. I obsessed about it, graduated, started a business, failed a business, sold one, paid off my debts, and just worked a lot.

I firmly believe that if you keep your head down, work hard, and develop fiscal responsibility, you will become affluent.

Present day I have a 6 figure job that is effortless. I have my own my own place in a gentrified area of a tip-of-your-tongue global city, and spent the last 4 nights fucking different chicks and falling asleep before midnight.

I am 28 now, and feel like a king of sluts.

&#x200B;

# The king of shit

We tell young men all of the time to not live for chicks. Live for yourself. Be your own center, etc.

This is great. I mean, it would be great if people could pull it off. And the issue isn't that no one listens. They do, they (we) just cant really move the needle on our own value system.

The fact of the matter is that, if you obsess about money, you will actually get it. It's just not that hard. Women though? A good woman is so hard to find, it seems like they almost don't exist. Which is because they don't exist. It's the perfect dream.

And how could a young man with the world in front of him resist the fantasy of the perfect woman? Accordingly I think the live-for-yourself bullshit inevitably fails. It just can't compete with fantasy— some of which quite usefully informs our other ambitions. It's silly to triage fantasy into good and bad.

&#x200B;

# ""Wait, I want to be the king of sluts.""

This is the easy part. Men have it easy.

There is nothing on heaven or earth that will get an ogre chick laid. But men these days are so artsy, so rampantly doused in faggotry, if you have your shit together and your shoulders back, you will become the king of sluts if you want it. It's not a noble prize, and it's insanely overrated. Then again, this is really only evident when your dick is lodged in some chicks throat.

20-something chicks are so drawn to stability I'm surprised they aren't out fucking concrete slabs.

Ive wanted to plug chicks so long, it took me a while to realize I could. I was drunk with power for a minute, and I've since realized that the hunt continues.

I just wanted to shout against the wind for a minute saying it's really not all that it's cracked up to be. I feel the best when I am working on my home— building something. To this end the point I want to share:

# The first—

I've seen a lot of posts about vetting recently and holy shit that's a joke. Women are a mirror. If you shit your pants, they just shit theirs. Don't vet women, vet yourself.

# The second—

I know young men just want to get it wet, and that idea isn't going anywhere no matter how many of us say it's not all it's cracked up to be.

My thought is don't waste your time learning game. Don't waste your intellect tricking chicks into becoming DNA receptacles.

867,fc5hyx,"**tl;dr:** To get over ""approach anxiety"", learn how to *initiate* conversations with people without any other goal to the interaction than the initiation. Practice it. Then approaching the beautiful women will just be a natural part of your already developed habit of just initiating talking to people.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Intro**

It's Sunday night and I feel like writing. This post is based on my answer to a question posed a few weeks back in some comments about ""how do I learn how to approach strangers?""

As an older dude, going out in public for the sole purpose of looking for cuties then rushing up to them trying to convince them to give me their numbers - ""cold approach"" - is just unseemly. But I'm an older dude, that's how I roll. Others have great luck with it. But many seem to struggle with the process.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**The Problem**

I see a lot of posts here and on / ask about either how to cold approach the pretty women (the ""cheat code"" method); or how the poster has gone out and cold approached *x-hundred* number of women and totally failed. The way I see it, the problem is that these kinds of ""cold approach"" exercises give off a vibe of ""I'm trying to get laid"" and ""I'm desparate to get laid."" Women sense this - they're good at that.

The problem, then, is that you haven't learned how to *sincerely and naturally initiate* a conversation with someone. You get butterflies, your palms sweat, your voice chokes in your throat, your eyes get shifty.

Fake - that is to say, insincere - opening lines with the goal of getting a phone number then exiting is an unnatural way of going about meeting your next future ex wife. It will have you unnaturally pushing the conversationg toward the number close - your unspoken goal - rather than having a natural end to the convo that may or may not have you deciding to accept her number.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**The Natural Way to Meet People**

Take this wisdom from my 50+ years of breathing: you have to want to meet and learn about new people, sincerely. I was blessed with an uncle who could talk to anyone - literally he spoke with governors and big-city mayors and men of importance on a daily basis, but would take 20 minutes to discuss the night's sports game with the guy taking the tickets or parking his car. I asked him his secret once and he told me that he just genuinely likes meeting new people. No purpose, no hidden agenda, in talking with people other than that.

This can be learned, because when I was younger, ""other people"" were just nuisances or there to be exploited. Now I see the wisdom in meeting them, learning about them, getting to know them even if for a brief 30 second fun chat. *I've become that man who can start a conversation with anyone about anything or nothing at all.*

But it has taken years of practice before it felt natural and sincere.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**What Is this New Theory, Do Not Read This?**

It's not a new theory you silly reader. ""Approach anxiety"" comes from putting too much pressure on the incipient relationship *before it's even begun.* Gotta get the digits - Gotta get the digits - Gotta get the digits.

I was at a networking event back in \[my old city\] and some random dude zooms through all the little groups shoving his business card into everyone's hands, then books it out of there. He had learned that if you trade digits, you're succeeding. But did he get the business equivalent of ""laid"" from those insincere digit exchanges? Of course not, nobody knew anything about him, why would they send him business?

""Cold approach for digits"" is an *outcome* based way of meeting someone, and it requires that stranger to meet the expectations you've created for the relationship, but haven't told them about. And when they don't meet those unspoken expectations that you haven't told them about, you get disappointed. Approach anxiety comes from anticipating that disappointment (also known as rejection) because the number of disappointing outcomes starts to pile up quickly.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**What If I Told You Your Success Rate Could Be 100%?**

So what to do? Come at it from a different perspective, that is, learn how to *initiate* conversations. That's it. That's your goal. Don't worry about the digits, don't worry about what you're going to talk about three minutes into the convo, don't worry about *just the right moment* to ask for the digits. That will happen.

When your goal is to *initiate* rather than number-close, you win \*every single time you initiate\*!

Just learn how to initiate. *With anyone and everyone.* That's an important part of it. Not just the pretties, but the store clerks, the bus driver, the guy taking your ticket as you go into the hockey game, the waitress, the lady standing next to you looking for eggs in the store (""When did buying eggs get so complicated?"" and lolz ensue).

Why? Because do this 10,000 times like I have and it becomes second nature. *Initiate* mini-conversations everywhere, and you'll find yourself doing it without even thinking. Woman I'm going out with now rolls her eyes when she sees me gearing up to initiate - but she loves the social proof that I know someone *everywhere we go* after years of doing this in my new hometown.

**How, Dude?**

Glad you asked.

Talk to everybody. *Everybody!* Even if it's just  ""have a nice day"" to the checkout lady at the supermarket, say something to a stranger every chance you get just to get used to *initiating* talking to strangers and getting out of your head and past that lump in your throat and that rush of adrenaline that stops you from talking to strangers. Inure your body to it and it will eventually stop happening - you'll train yourself to not react when you're about to initiate.

Learn how to do it in a natural setting; that is to say, in every day affairs. It's normal to talk to the cashier at the grocery about your groceries; it's not normal to run up to a pretty girl at random and start talking (remember that dude rushing around passing out his business card - was that you ""cold approaching"" last week?). Having some canned chatter that's appropriate to a dozen circumstances is great; even better is if you learn to improv based on your then-present circumstances.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Here's Some Bullet Points Because People Like Bullet Points**

By ""canned chatter"" I don't mean a corny opening line that you use on everyone. ""Chatter"" has to be (a) situationally appropriate, (b) get their attention and interest, *and* (c) be geared to get a response. All three.

Examples of *initiating* a conversation (and please, \*smile\* when you say this):

* To a cashier: ""I'll bet I'm the \[rudest/funniest/best looking\] person to come through your line today"". This will get you a minute or so of banter.
* To the guy taking your ticket: ""I sure hope \[our team\] can beat \[rival team\] tonight"" (yeah, that simple - you just started a convo with a stranger, man!). This will get you anywhere from a minute to three hours of banter.
* What's  your favorite team? If you see someone with a ball cap or shirt with your team's logo on it, smile and say ""Go \[your team\]"" and when they  smile back, ask about the team - how are they going to be this year, boy  they stunk last year, do you think they'll beat \[rival\] next week, how's the new coach going to work out?  Likewise, if someone is wearing your team's rival's logo, smile at them  and say ""Boo \[rival\]!"" and have the similar conversation.
* Two  ladies at the tea shop the other day had the same unusual color shirt  on - me, walking past them: ""Did you two coordinate outfits to look nice  for me today?"" Smile! They said some clever response, and we all moved on with our lives.
* To the waitress last night, ""Big crowd tonight, huh? You would think the cold would keep people at home."" Chatter chatter smile chatter.
* Girl  in line behind you at the store wearing yoga pants, ""what's your favorite yoga pose?"" They \*always\* answer that one. Tell 'em ""that's  easy, pick a harder one!""

Talk to men and women, young and old, pretty or ugly. It's all about practice and comfort to desensitize your body from that jolt of anxiety you get right when you formulate the idea to inititate. Learn how to initiate and it will become second nature.

You  get the idea - it's not ""pickup lines""; it's just having something clever to say to start them talking with you. Talk for a minute then exit the convo.

**But Do Not Read This, How Do I Get The Precious Digits?**

That's for another post. For now, I'll say it again - go out there and practice *initiating* as your goal, not having a stranger fulfil some unspoken requirement you've put on them which then results in multiple ""failures"".

868,fcbtwg,"Hey there everyone,

First of all, here is the link to our Reading Group :   [https://www.trp.red/feed/t/plato](https://www.trp.red/feed/t/plato) 

This is an initiative from two [TRP.RED](https://TRP.RED) members LeashedDoggie(me) and Bukharin.

At first, we just wanted to read Plato's Republic between ourselves and exchange notes.  However, once we joined [TRP.RED](https://TRP.RED), we found the website really fun and saw that we could use the tribe feature to find even more people who would be interested in reading this classic with us. At this point, I would like to thank u/Redpillschool for giving us this capability. We are really greatful and look forward to the forums.

We managed to find 12 other [TRP.RED](https://TRP.RED) members who are currently reading the book with us. We also had the honor of u/Gaylubeoil joining and reading the book with us.

&#x200B;

How it works?

Well, every week we start off by reading a Book from the Republic (currently at Book 3) as well as consult university lectures you can find links to in our sidebar. We then have to post a short text sharing our notes and observations with the rest of the group every Friday. On Saturdays and Sundays we all have the opportunity to discuss our notes with each other and on Sunday I post a general feedback post summing everything up.

On Sundays we also have a fun little game called ""the purge"" where people who contacted me and told me they cannot contribute anymore get to choose how their character gets killed off. This is of course done in a friendly way and these members get to stay in the group as audience and participate without having to submit anything.

How to join?

In fact, everyone can just join in here as subscribers, read the book and the notes we post without posting themselves:  [https://www.trp.red/feed/t/plato](https://www.trp.red/feed/t/plato) 

Still, we would very much appreciate getting the chance to get to know more of you, so if anyone here would like to read Plato's Republic with us and share your notes and thoughts with the rest of the group then please contact me, LeashedDoggie or Bukharin over in [TRP.RED](https://TRP.RED) and we will make it happen.

For the week beginning today you just have to read Book 1 and Book 2 and message a 500 word summary text of both books to LeashedDoggie on [TRP.RED](https://TRP.RED). Check our tribe here and read the submissions of our contributors  [https://www.trp.red/feed/t/plato](https://www.trp.red/feed/t/plato)  for examples of how your text could look like.

Thank you for reading. We look forward to meeting you over at [TRP.RED](https://TRP.RED)

869,fc1g0w,"TL;DR - the cognitive difference between men and women is that women are incapable of being interested in things that do not have any practical role in their pursuit of security, comfort, and stimulation. To be female means to invalidate any unnecessary risks and theoretical pursuits, while men, biologically numbed to anxiety, are endlessly driven to pursue ""unnecessary"" and theoretical purposes, and in doing so, enrich both their realities and women's

Women are interested in the concrete; Men are interested in the abstract

---



Women and men have evolved to serve very different societal roles, that much I'm sure you are already well aware of. I do see however, no shortage of men, even on this sub, who still feel as if female behavior is somehow vindictive and malicious. A lot of you, it seems, are confused about why women act with an almost animal-like selfishness and instinct for self-preservation. To be frank, these instincts really are primal, and I'll explain why that makes perfect sense, and why for things to be any other way would be evolutionary impossible. So with that in mind, it's necessary to whittle down the difference between male and female thinking to its bare bones and demonstrate why human men alone, from among all living creatures are prone to an idealistic worldview.

---




# FEMALE PRAGMATISM and MALE IDEALISM

To start off, there is a saying, that ""if women ruled society, we would still be living in grass huts"". Why is this true? Why are men uniquely equipped to pursue progress and think beyond what is possible? The answer to this question is simple, and is likely something that many of you already know - women are evolutionary programmed to pursue security and comfort. That's all and well, but what many don't realize is that this is more than an iron rule - this is holy law. It's written into the source code of existence. Women don't care for anything that lies beyond the fog of war of apparent possibility or immediate necessity - this is also why women are not natural long-term thinkers.

And all this makes perfect sense from an evolutionary standpoint. Men can afford to take risks and wonder at the possibility of the apparently impossible - the men who have are the ones who have passed on their genes. Now put yourself in the shoes of a woman for a moment - women are inherently ***terrified of everything***. And again, this makes perfect sense - the moment you are a woman and you stop being terrified, is the moment you do something stupid and get killed, or excommunicated from the tribe, which typically also meant death. Women are biologically programmed to be scared to death of everything, and this is the engine that drives them forward - every single cognitive function a woman has, is in service of, first and foremost, guaranteeing the security and comfort of herself and her offspring (the need to procreate is second). Staying safe and staying part of the tribe are paramount, because a woman is neither physically nor psychologically equipped to deal with the loss of either, and that is completely natural. This is how every animal functions, so there is nothing out of the ordinary there.

So now for the interesting part: Namely, why men are anomalies of nature. The reason why men can't understand the female security-and-comfort mania is because evolutionary, we have mostly been numbed to our awareness of it (men with low testosterone do have it, but that is another topic altogether). We don't understand fanatic pragmatism, because it has been evolutionary stunted, which is exactly why men are such idealists. It is exactly the reason men so often stubbornly refuse to acknowledge the truth because of a personal belief. It is also the reason why men are obsessed with exploring ideas, fantasies, and hypothetical situations. It's the reason why men dreamed up the world as we know it and built it. That same anxiety that paralyses women is absent in strong and capable men, because they are genetically conditioned by nature to strive towards the unknown, to be fascinated by it, to venture into it and conquer it.

**Disclaimer**: the lower half of this post got deleted for some reason, but the short version is this: women are cognitively interested in the what is either beneficial, or already proven as possible, while men are capable of being interested in the abstract, hypothetical, and fantastical, that might have no anchor in reality. Women are genetically built to adopt these abstractions and ideals so as to conform and remain in the tribe, however as soon as a principle is no longer immediately beneficial, it is abandoned.

Women are generally interested in only four categories of interests:
1. Stimulating (makes her excited or feel good)
2. Meaningful (appeals to her deeper emotions)
3. Purposeful (serves the accomplishment of a certain goal or process) - this includes the pursuit of comfort and security
4. Relevant (relates to her current context of reality in some way)

Anything beyond those four categories, women have a natural tendency to invalidate. **Women are interested in the tangible, not the abstract.** The theoretical only becomes interesting to women when it comes time to reap the rewards. This is why women are, for the most part, interested in art, sports, philosophy, etc. only once someone else has cleared the way for them first. Women are every bit as fascinated by the transcendental as men are, but their capacity to pursue or create it is nearly non-existent.

Men, on the other hand have a tendency to maintain beliefs and interests that are external to, or in opposition to reality, which is also why men are prone to get lost in fantasy and the hypothetical, and also develop idealistic worldviews which get them killed. The chief takeaway is this: 
1. we, as men, need to understand out nature to avoid getting taken advantage of by others, and also work on the concrete steps to applying our idealism in reality, so as to not get stuck in the fantasy and hypothesis stage.
2. Don't expect women to act against their nature and stand by ideals. Ideals are only for those stubborn and resilient enough to afford them. Women are psychologically and physically fragile, so it's against reason for them to uphold a principle as an end in of itself.",869,4.0,0.5385000109672546,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

Train your ass off at the gym ,get a 6-pack and someone with a camera. Take a shirtless pic, download Tinder, realise girls are horny AF, fuck a lot of them.

**My journey**

So this is going to be a long post, part FR, part story of personal triumph, part guide.

Let me start at the beginning. I've always been a bit awkward socially, more of an introvert type. Speak only when adressed to, cut to the chase kind of guy. I've always have friends and aquaintances, but I've never been that ""social guy"" everyone just seems to be attracted to.

At this point, I'd like to clarify that I'm a pretty decent looking kind of guy. I'll ofen get compliments about my face and such, yet here's one of my ""problems"": I'm pretty short. 5'6 short. 150 pounds. I love doing sports and hitting the gym, so I'm lean and have some muscle, yet I'm a ""small"" guy. So everywhere I go I feel like everyone is just a giant compared to me.

In the girls department, I've had girlfriends, friends who are girls, and everything in between. I could pickup up a girl with relative ease if someone introduced us, or if we had something in common, like sharing a hobby. HOWEVER I could never cold approach. And I mean never.

At a bar, street, birthday party, work, if I saw a girl, my mind just went blank. Not a sound would pour out of my mouth. I would get looks and invitations and all those things do when they like you, and I still couln't approach shit. I've tried everything: meditation, asking for the time, just saying hello, giving a friend all my money until I approached, 3 second rule, inner game, outer game, everything.

I know what some of you may be thinking. ""Man up and approach"". Stop being a bitch. Pussy.

And I get it. I really do. And I would LOVE it if I could. Just throwing myself out there, all alpha and not giving a shit.  But I can't. I've tried, and It's just not in me. So here I was, being able to get girls when fate just threw them on my lap, yet being unable to just GO for the ones I saw and liked. I wanted to be that fearless, unstoppable guy who just barges in, James bond Style, and says ""Hey, what's up"" like it's as easy as taking a shit.

How could I do that if I couldn't approach? Surely there has to be SOMETHING I can do, there are many ways to skin a cat after all. So instead of going the prescribed route, Inner game&gt;build confidence&gt; not giving a shit&gt; approaching and failing&gt;getting girls through cold approach&gt; get better&gt; get even more girls I went the other way round.

Enter TINDER.

Now what I'm gonna say isn't new. It's been talked about countlesss times here in TRP, but I just want to emphasize its amazing, effective, almost godlike power. If anyone is in a similar situation just please, PLEASE try this.

I used Tinder as a crutch. I had had tinder before, **with reasonable success, but nothing too crazy. Couple of hot girls, plenty of effort, lots of ignored messages**. But this time, I was going to become that 5% of guys who get the 95% of the girls.

I bought a DLSR camera (because I'm also into photography). I cut weight until I had a 6-pack. Rocked a new haircut, let my beard grow. And then I took a picture. Sitting in my kitchen, drinking coffee, no shirt. Edited it a bit, added some nice filters. It looked good. It's a good instagrammable pic.

So I created a new Tinder account, and uploaded this one, single picture. Just some reasonably good looking dude with a 6 pack. That's it. And then the magic happened.

Matches started pouring in. And I mean POURING. Dozens of girls, all shapes and sizes. Lots of 7s and 8s, a few 9s, a couple of stunners. Curvy, flat, cute, tall, short. It was just insane. In two days, I got 200 matches, and that is filtering for girls who are 7+. And a lot of them were actually approaching me. ""Hey, I like your style"", ""Hey wanna grab a drink"", ""Hey you up?""

I was getting so MUCH attention it was like a high. I started setting up dates, one a day until my schedule was full for 10 days. Some days I had to set up two dates. Girls were piling up, demanding my time, and I just didn't have any more availability. And it hit me. THIS IS what being a girl feels like.

This is the attention we give them all of the time. This is what it feels to have a horde of guys constantly messaging you, wanting to hang out. Some of them you might actually like, but there's just not enough time.

I went on a binge. Girls in the morning, girls in the afternoon, girls at night. A lot of them I had sex with the first night, some of them I just kissed, a couple of them never called back. But they kept piling up and kept on coming, and Tinder was still getting matches. I was full of that feminine energy, and thrilled of having a different, warm butt to grab at night.

Eventually, getting a date was as simple as going to work. I still got a bit of ""jingles"" right before the date, but it vanished as soon as I saw the girl and bear hugged them. Talking became second nature. I started forgetting my routines, and questions and pick up shit. And I started rambling about my life. There was a intensity in me, in how I saw these girls, an emotion and energy that almost exploded around me. And girls feel it. They KNOW you are getting pussy. They KNOW you've got plenty of other girls. They KNOW you are good. And they just follow your lead.

And this is when finally, all the TRP knowledge just clicked in my head. Frame. Be confident, and girls will follow. Stare at them like you are about to rip their clothes off and fuck them right there at the bar. Use silences. Don't give a fuck. Words pouring out of my mouth. Nothing really matters that much. Be bold. Kiss and touch early. Go for the fuck ASAP.

She doesn't like you? Who cares? I've got 50 more waiting to hang out.

And here's the beautiful part. This shit just started impregnating my whole life. Suddenly, I was talking with the security dude at work for 10 minutes. Turns up he's a really cool dude.

I was chatting up girls at the gym. Gay guys openly flirting with me, and I'm cool with that. I'll laugh and say thank you and befriend them.

Girls in the street? I'll smile at them and wink an eye. Some of them might be creeped out. So what. A couple blush and laugh. One gave me her number.

It's like a superpower, finally being able to be social. To not give a fuck. To express my personality. I'm more interesting, I'm sharper, hell it feels like I'm smarter.



**Where I'm at now**

It's been 2 weeks since my girl binge. I deleted Tinder. There were just so many girls it was just distracting. I barely had time for myself. I'm keeping a couple of plates I really like around.

I'm finally that dude girls really like. Maybe I always was, but just couldn't throw myself out there. And I feel like I can get any girl I want, anywhere (Even if I can't, I'm not delusional).

Shallow? Vain? Maybe. But it feels amazing. I think this was something I had to experience, and get it out of my system. And it has put me on track.

I feel great. I feel strong. I value my ""ME"" time a lot more. Reading a book, just chilling at home, watching a movie. I have more energy to go after the things I want. I have this excess of momentum inside. I'm improving myself at the gym, profesionally, also starting a new career.

So thank you. Thank you TRP, and thank all of you who take the time to teach us something. Thank you for your field reports and guides, and inner stuff I now understand.

And thank the god of Tinder, for being my crutch.


If you guys want more info, have any questions about tinder game of just game in general, any criticisims, anything, they are all welcome. I really hope this helps someone like it helped me. Cheers.

[Proof of my around 200 matches.](https://imgur.com/a/qM6oC5m) Stopped swiping a week ago. Don't know how to prove it's from the last 20 days, so you are gonna have to trust me on that one.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** A lot of guys are asking me to post my pic. I won't for two reasons. One is, even If I blurred my face, it would still be recognisable, and I do not want that.

Second is, I don't want this to turn into a discussion about my pic, my weight, my abs, my hair or whatever. Trust me guys, it's a pic of a shirtless dude. **That is it.** There's no magic, no mystery, no nothing. If you want some inspiration, go to pinterest and type shirtless guy.

My message stands: Get a 6-pack. Girls are horny and like 6-packs. That is all you need to be sucessful on tinder.

[**I will however, upload the pic I used as an inspiration.**](https://imgur.com/a/L3OZvub) It is VERY similar to the one I used, same angles, same filters, same kitchen, same 6-pack. I'm smaller though. Doesn't seem to matter. Hope this helps.

**EDIT2:** some of you are saying ""HA! Of course that works in Argentina!"". Girls are particularly hard to get here. You can read Roosh's compendium on Argentina for more info. Also, out of 200 matches, around 30% are foreign girls. European, asian, american.

Also swiped in NYC and the amount of matches stayed the same. Point being, again, women like shirtless dudes, even if they won't admit it.

**EDIT3:** The amount of comments, inboxes and positive feedback has been astonishing guys. Thank you all for your input, and I will do my best to answer to each and every one of you. On the next few weeks, I will be uploading a detailed, step by step,tinder guide, from first message to date. I will also add some field reports and general guidelines for dates. 
When I have some free time. 

Now some of you don’t seem to be getting the message, and maybe that’s on me. I see a lot of anger and resentment, and that’s not what I’m after. 
Just to be clear, I AM NOT A MODEL. I WASNT POPULAR IN HIGH SCHOOL. I HAVE NOT WON THE GENETIC LOTTERY. In fact, I got picked on most of my life for being short, small, weak. Jeez, that’s as far from being genetically gifted as you can be. 

I used to get average results on Tinder. The only thing I have going for me is a decent looking face. Now I could either take advantage of the shallowness of this age or curl in a ball and keep bashing on the internet.
I chose the first one. I grew a beard so I looked more mature. I grew my hair long, because I wanted to try it. I worked my ass off at the gym, until you could see my abs. I found a good look, bought some cool clothes and accesories and changed my style. And I dated girls until I got told “you have this intensity inside you” and I could fuck a girl in 40 minutes (that’s a story for another day).

This whole story is about improving yourself and using (abusing) a platform where looks matter so much, if you can get abs and some good pics you are already top 5%.
So trust me, if you put in the work and take advantage of the superficiality of social media, you WILL GET RESULTS. It doesn’t matter if you are black,asian,tall, short, or ugly. You WILL BE BETTER THAN BEFORE. And it will pour into your regular life.

Also no one who parrots this really knows anything about endocrinology or how hormones work in the body nor how they relate to food intake and exercise. So there are a bunch of studies people reference when talking about this one from 1987, one from 2006 and one from 2016 and 2007. One talks about grip strength, one talks about testosterone dropping about 1% since the 80s etc. So why is this happening? Nobody tries to find out the actual reason they just assume its genetic. So i'm here to tell you why test is supposedly dropping.

There are many things that play into testosterone and estrogen levels one is foods. With the rise of fast food and massive amounts of sugar injection into our society, this hasn't helped testosterone at all, lean meats good sleep and good nutrition keep testosterone and muscle levels high.

FAT our society is far fatter than it was in 1980 fat actually lowers testosterone substantially and raises estrogen substantially. since the 80's physical activity has been plummeting. when I was in grade school even in the early 2000s before smartphones became king our parents all forced us to be outside most of the day and we were only allowed to play inside on a tv or with video games for a max of 2 hours a day. there was usually only a couple fat kids in school and we played outside for hours. Playing fighting and exercise all raise testosterone. Now skinny kids are the minority, as i'm driving by schools coming home from work I take note of people passing by and almost all the kids are fat or tubby looking down at their smartphones. Kids are raised on tv and internet now instead of a steady diet of play.

A few weeks ago I saw a picture of a huge party festival that was going on in the 70s there were over 1000 people in the photo. every single person was lean and every single man had 6 pack abs Now you go to the mall and most people have a gut. If you want to raise your test, stop eating shit, start exercising, get lean.

ever notice how soyboys/male feminists are always tubby balding neckbeards? I wish someone would do a study on this lol. Anyway I believe this is part of the attack of masculinity, oh you're testosterone is lowering you're toxic women are taking over. Plus it generally comes from radical feminists who champion the death of the nuclear family. We have already seen fast steps to make this happen in academia, religious bigotry etc than runs rampant there, medicating males that are hard to handle in youth because they are energetic.

What movement/ way do you think we could turn all this around? Clearly it needs to happen as men are doing worse and worse in academia.

edit: to the people saying people didnt work out in the 80s and they were just fat slobs what type of dope are you smoking I need some of that. they used to have chinup bars rope climbing all types of sports in schools. people were obsessed with sports and getting on football teams and most guys played. My dad was born in the 50s and lifted weights his entire life, kids were obsessed with becoming wrestlers and teenagers worked out. No they were not the most healthy people that ever lived but they were leaner, were outside more  and eating more home cooked meals, not mcdonalds and sour patch kids/ had more physical jobs/ factory work. Also there is a study debunking the original study that said test levels in men were dropping so ya give your head a shake.

**Human Capital:**  Every second you spend in your dorm room squeezing your baby sausage, playing video games, or reading non-GayLubeOil posts on Reddit, is time wasted. Why? Because there are literally thousands of people walking around campus waiting for you to exploit them and that isn't going to happen if you're covered in  semen holding an Xbox controller. Human capital isn't built in isolation. Human capital is created by meeting people, figuring out their strengths, and bringing them into your frame. Human capital is what you are going to use to amass life's three most important resources: knowledge, money, and vagina. So get the fuck out of your dorm and go meet people until your phone is packed with names like Calculus Ken, Rim-job Rosana, and Trashy Tessa. 

**Slut Ranching:** Every person has a purpose. For sluts that purpose is taking dick. Sluts don't make good wives, girlfriends, or friends because taking strange dick is their top priority and supersedes any and all meaningful obligations. The other side of the equation is that most men are thirsty as fuck. Thirst supersedes logic. A man who thinks with his penis is not reasoning with his mind. Such  men are easy to exploit, just ask any purse, jewelry, or fur coat salesman. This is why slut ranching is so profitable. Men make horrible decisions in the presence of sluts. Which is why you should surround yourself with sluts and seek to profit off of lesser men. College campuses are packed with sluts. Try to friend-zone as many as you can, so you can herd them to social events. Bringing sluts is one of the fastest ways to build social value. It won't take long for men to start begging you to bring your sluts at which point you can name your price.


**Nerd Herding:** Unfortunately, there is more to university than finger blasting Sorority Samantha before shaking hands with her dad. University is all about grades. Grades are what are going to get you into grad school and postpone your entry into the job market until the coming off the Antichrist, at which point the economy won't matter anymore.

It's far easier to learn from nerds than [Professor Tunak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTIIMJ9tUc8) who only talks about shit that isn't on the test. Nerds digest the information for you, arrange it into neat outlines, and make studying way easier. Unfortunately, nerds aren't going to let you mooch indefinitely, you need leverage. Take your nerd to small social gatherings like barbecues, introduce him to the girl he's going to pedastlize. It's kind of like being a CIA handler or Steve jobs. As long as the nerd gives you what you need you give him what he needs. The second he stops being useful dump him like Steve Wozniak.

**Building Value:** While exploiting other people's value is awesome, it is important to have something of your own to bring to the table. Value takes many forms. Knowing how to mix good drinks is value. Grilling a great steak is value. Driving viewers to a web site is value. Value is contextual. To be successful you need to understand your value and how to get the best price for it. If you feel that you lack value you can always build it, especially if you are young. So get out there and utilize your value, build your value, or exploit other people's value. Anything is possible, especially if you are the kind of person who has no problem looking a man in the eye and firmly shaking his hand, after vigorously finger-blasting his daughter.

> [TIME] It’s a sort of sneaky feminism. When you say the premise—a woman warrior escapes with female sex slaves—that doesn’t necessarily sound like a blockbuster. But because it’s an action film, guys will see it. Something similar is happening with another summer film: Amy Schumer, who’s a really outspoken feminist comedian, is coming out with the rom-com Trainwreck. LeBron James is in the movie, which I think might lure men who might not otherwise go. Is that subversive feminism the best way to address women’s issues in film?

> [Ensler] One day, we won’t have to sneak it. One day we will be overt. One of the great things about this film is that when you have women on your side, you have a better chance of surviving. It’s clear that we’re all served better when women are equal. We don’t want to dominate. We just want our stories to be given equal consideration—to also get a spot on the playing field.

**Introduction**

-

The following report is (edit: the first) one of a few hangouts I've done with the same woman. We do 'date-like' things. Some of this will be in a small portion of a book I've been working on outlining the path from lone wolf cold approach to proximity and social circle game. The journey we've been on will illustrate several concepts I attempt to convey about attractive women and social circle game. This one encounter opened me up to a new world which I'll describe in later reports with her. 

-

Now let's begin...

-

----------------------------------
------------------------------------

**Body**

-

I was going through security at a courthouse when a hot foreign girl came in line behind me. Nice tits. She was accompanied by an older schlub. I could hear her speaking one of the two other languages I can speak, 'Language Y' (enough competence to flirt with women). I attempt at some small talk. 

-

**Me**: *""Why are you here? You a criminal?""*, smirk on my face

-

**Her**: *""No! Just paying for a speeding ticket.""*

-

I forgot what else I said, but further interaction required disruption of the security process, look desperate, and looks bad socially. I didn't detect enough interest to go further. Moved on.

-

I check for my name on the screens, go up stairs, and enter the courtroom. I choose to sit at the very back on the bench. There were a few others already waiting. Nothing happened for a few minutes. 

-

Suddenly, I spot a girl to my left entering the room, she appears to be of a race that speaks one of the other languages I speak. Let's call her 'Rachel'.  She's cute, has nice tits, and is wearing tights that show off some booty. Yum. She sits down two benches in front of me to the left, a few people-widths inside. There are two men behind her. I don't remember the exact conditions, but I do remember wondering if some of the people around her were family/friends. This made me pause for a bit to strategize my approach. Approach anxiety was kind of there, but that's never my problem. My issue is being able to navigate this context properly so that negative social mechanisms don't kick in and shutdown my operation. **A girl can be totally into you, but then she senses her image is at stake then withdraws completely and you look stupid. Has happened before**. 

-

Eventually I determine that there are no social roadblocks in my way. She is vulnerable for approach now. It won't get anymore convenient than this moment. No one's sitting to her left blocking the entrance to the bench, and no one to the right for more than 15 ft. The opportunity lingers. All I have to do is walk over there. My window is closing. Just one person can screw it all up. Rationalizations about why I shouldn't try are going through my head. But if I don't attempt now, I'll forever hate myself. Rejection is better than regret. I make my move.

-

As I enter the bench, I use the language (language X). 

-

**Me**: *""Excuse me. Is anybody sitting there?""* (Me pointing to her right)

-

**Rachel**: *""Oh. Uhmm, no.""*

-

I squeeze in front of her and sit two people spaces to the right of her so as to not come across too strong. Chill for a moment. Don't look at her.

-

**Me**: *""What are you doing here?""* (Language X)

-

**Rachel**: (Doesn't seem to understand)

-

**Me**: (Repeat myself with better annunciation)

-

Turns out she's here because of some altercation with a friend. 

-

(Here on out, our conversation is a mix of Language X and English because she can't speak a lot of English)

-

She inquires about my appearance here. I tell her I'm seeing if I'm going to jail. This creates bait for her to ask more questions about me, creating more investment. Also, I keep some mystery while mixing in some badboy. Oh did I tell you I have a 'badboy' look? 

-

**Rachel**: ""What did you do?""

-

**Me**: (I tell her)

-

She goes more into depth about her situation and can't understand her summons sheet (written in English). An IOI most certainly. I take this opportunity as an excuse to scoot closer to her. She's wondering if she's at risk of going to jail. The paperwork doesn't say so, she's just summoned to act as a witness to the crime she charged her friend for.

- 

She asks if I've ever been arrested other times. I don't hold back on my history and my shenanigans. If there's one thing I've learned, crime, even violent crime is a panty-wetter. I once jokingly said I just got back from court deciding my fate on a liquor store robbery me and my friends were accused of. ""Not guilty"". She ate that shit up. Attraction over 9000. Just went along with it to see where it goes. I buttered her up and screwed up later, but that's not relevant. 

-

**Rachel**: *""You're soooo bad""* teehee hehe.

-

We chill for a moment. But I can see her fidgeting. She looks nervous. I ask her what's wrong. She says she's nervous with a shy smile. She changed her mind, she doesn't want to charge her friend anymore. She doesn't want her to go to jail. I lean over, put my hand on her shoulder and tell her it will be alright. I was the one who might get sentenced, but wasn't nervous, and most certainly wasn't going to show it. I'm the rock now. 

-

She starts touching me while talking some more. Indirect permission to escalate granted. I put my arm around her on the seat, caressing her shoulder slightly. She looks completely comfortable with it, doesn't acknowledge it. Turns out her friend and her friends mother were sitting in the same row as us on the other side to the right, giving us dirty looks. All I said was fuck her, if a 'friend' did that to me, they can go fuck themselves. Left it at that. I've learned to not delve into the affairs of a woman's life, just let her vent and just listen.

-

Other cases are going on. A bunch of idiots trying to bullshit their way out of their D.U.Is and drug charges. I wasn't buying it. The judge most certainly wasn't. Even a security guard laughed at some of them. I translate some of that to her and make fun of them. She tells me I'm so mean. Eventually I ask if she has a pen. She doesn't and asks why.

-

**Me**: *""You're going to write your number on my paper (summons sheet)""* (No phones allowed in court)

- 

**Rachel**: *""Oh really?""*

-

**Me**: *""Yes""*

-

I ask the woman two seats over if she has a pen I can borrow. She does and I give it to Rachel. *Number acquired*. Then I remember a lesson I learned at a bar once, always ask about her logistics in the middle of your session, not towards the end when she gets drunk and things become out of your control and can't close. So I ask her how she got here. She says she took the bus. 

-

**Me**: *""Maybe I can drop you off. Where do you live?""*

-

**Rachel**: (she can't pronounce her English street name)

-

I realized her summons sheet has her address. Perfect.

-

**Me**: *""I live only 5 mins away from here, you're only around 20mins away. It's not a big deal; I can drop you off""*

-

**Rachel**: *""Yeah, sure""*

-

*Now, we're getting somewhere*.

-

Her time is coming near based on the amount of people left. She's still nervous, I still caress her. She asks me if I can come up to the podium with her for support (how cute and feminine. Now I really want to violate her). I tell her I can't, but that she'll do fine. 

-

Her time comes up. She walks to the stand. She keeps looking back at me while speaking.

**Judge**: *""Why do you keep looking back there""*

-

**Rachel**: (No answer, keeps talking)

-

**Me**: (She's looking back at Papa Warlock, that's what she's doing)


-

There's a camera here monitoring all of us, monitoring me running some smooth game. Oh yeah.

-

Case Verdict: Friend gets a $1000+ fine and a record, no jail time.

-

Rachel sits back with me with my arm around her instead of the chair (slight escalation). The mother comes to our side and speaks in front of us to Rachel in Language X. I only caught bits and pieces, but I can tell it was shaming. Turns out it was...

-

**Mother**: ~*""How could you do that to a friend?""* Blah blah blah excuses.

-

I laughed and told her fuck them. Don't worry about it. 

-

My Case: Reduced fine on the condition I don't get another conviction, no jail time because I got lucky for reasons not relevant.

-

We exit the room and start walking towards the parking garage. I make sure nothing can fuck this up. I've gotten too far to fail. We get there. She offers to pay and even gives me her debit card pin. I spray the car with febreeze and a hint of cologne before she got in. She liked it, didn't care about the mess. She stays in the car. I tell her I'm taking the keys just in case she's a car thief. Parking paid. Drive off to her house playing Language X music. I take videos of us driving singing and laughing for my IG story. Letting the other girls know Dr. Warlock still got it. She admits to having a baby. I just say 'oh'. Cute, older than 24. Someone already impregnated her? *Shocker*.

-

We arrive near her apartment and start walking. As an excuse to go inside, I say I'd like to see the baby. She says it's at her aunt's house nearby.

-

**Me**: *""Oh I thought it was at your house. Let's walk to yours first, maybe we'll do that later""*

-

We arrive at the building entrance.

-

**Me**: *""Can I use your bathroom?""*

-

**Rachel**: *""Sure, that's fine""*

-

We go inside. There's a rocking baby chair near the door. Turns out I do have some urine to drain. 

-

She walks towards her room and starts fumbling around, I take a peek.

-

**Rachel**: *""No no no. You can't look. It's messy!* hehe. 

-

She grabs my arm and asks if I want something to drink.  I say yes.

-

We go in and she starts cooking something while listening to some music on her phone. She begins swaying her hips and getting into the music. Signal received, sweety. I begin some slight dancing, slowly getting closer to her. I grab her hand and slowly pull her to me grabbing her hips. I can feel those big tits on me. She turns herself around and starts grinding on me. I put my face in the crook of her neck and kiss her cheek. She puts my hands on her tits and starts kissing me. Insert make-out sesh and me grabbing some ass. No resistance at all. I pick her up and place her on the kitchen counter, telling her we should do it right here in the kitchen.

-

**Rachel**: *""You're so baaaad. Teehee. Not here, people can see!""*

-

We break away and smile at each other. I get into a more casual mood and say hey, let's check out your room.

-

**Her**: *""Why? What are we going to do there?""*

-

I ignore her and start walking out the kitchen. She follows me. I go in and it's small and indeed messy. There's a baby crib at the foot of her bed. I don't give a shit. Not my kid , not my problem, not my house, I'm getting some booty. 

-

She walks in all embarrassed. I tell her I don't care, then pick her up and throw her onto the bed, me on top of her. 

-

**Rachel**: *""Omg, I just met you and we're already doing this!""*

-

**Me**: *""Shhhhh""*, and start kissing her. She's very enthusiastic. 

-

I start rubbing her vagina above the pants, no resistance and I can feel she's wet. So I go in under the pants, no resistance and start fingering her. At one point, she, on her own volition, starts removing her yoga pants. I can smell her pussy, that smell when it's really wet and ready to go. We get to business. I felt like a Chad, rubbing it in all the faces on the blue pill sub and every guy that says my tactics are wrong and doesn't work. Just met this girl 1.5 hours ago in court, looking like trouble, and already fucking. She turned for doggy, I go to town. There's a big mirror in front of the bed. I stare at myself thrusting. I think of the [American Psycho scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXNCcWPUkBA). Oh, yeah. 

-

I tell her to suck my dick. She happily obliges. She was sucking like a porn star, purposely gagging on it. 

-

She said, *""Tell me how to please you. I want to see you cum""*. Man, I'm liking this girl already.

-

Anyways... business done and we're just lying down. She's tired. Apparently, she texted one of her friends that she met some guy at court and sent a pic. Now her friend is like ""omg I can't believe you let a strange guy into your house. You're so bad"". At this point I was on full alert. In an attempt to prevent any ASD bullshit, I told her to tell her I only came into the use the bathroom and left in a light-hearted way. She agreed. Whew. 

-

Edit: She told me this was crazy. We're in a court room. Its not appropriate to try. She thought I was cute but didn't think I would walk over and talk to her. She liked the fact that I didn't care. All in cute broken English. 

-

She wants to get dressed and go back into the kitchen. 

-

**Me:** *""No clothes allowed. I wanna see your body some more""*

-

**Rachel**: *""So you're my boss?* , teehee (English)

-

**Me**: *""Yes, I'm your boss""* (Language X)

-

Before she gets off the bed, I spank her ass.

-

She tidies up in the bathroom naked, but her kitchen windows have no covers so she puts some clothes on. I don't bother. We walk to the kitchen and I'm naked.

-

**Rachel**: *""Omg my neighbors and probably see you""*

-

**Me**: *""I don't care, let them watch""*

-

I have a good physique. No shame whatsoever.

-

We chat for a bit. I get dressed. Tell her I'll text her later. Leave.

-

Parts 2+ coming soon to forum near you.

**Lessons Learned**

 * Learn a another language of a people whose women you find attractive. Foreign women > [American Woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzWHE32IxUc), even of the same color. School only gives you basics, is slow, and not much else. For proficiency, have a translator app on your phone, and you need to work around people that speak it or go to school/work abroad. Don't lie to yourself, you learned it to get pussy. 

 * My 'What are you doing here? Are you a criminal?' line was an intentional opener. It's accusatory in a fun way and gets her justify herself immediately. Has worked many times while a strange girl walked by me on the street, just not this time. 

 * Be aware of context. You liking her and her interested in you is not enough. Always be aware of the social situation. A girl can be totally into you, but then she senses her image is at stake then withdraws completely or even throws you under the bus. 

 * The best opportunities often occur when you're not looking for them. They happen so fast and often not at the best convenience. Act fast or the window will close. Rejection is better than regret. 

 * Criminal activity is never a negative for getting pussy. Neutral and often positive. Get arrested in front of a girl, committing crimes with her/in front of her, whatever, she likes it but often doesn't know it yet. Criminals often get the easiest and best pussy. That includes the 'sweet innocent' ones. Yo momma, yo daughter, yo sister, and yo wife. Not advocating crime, just telling you how it is.

 * You HAVE to be able to recognize indirect signs of interest and receptiveness to escalation. They are almost always INDIRECT. This girl asked me to help her read her summons sheet, that requires you to scoot closer. Don't mention it, just act. 'Just get it'. 

 * When she's nervous and uneasy or scared, you have to keep your cool. *""To be like a rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it""* – Marcus Aurelius. Let her flail around like a flag on a pole during a windy day, then return to rest. She'll thank you for it, I promise. Often in the form of pussy. You can hold her, shutup and just listen. Let her go through the emotional tide. That's all you need. That's what they consider, 'taking care of them'. 

 * When relocating for the bang, make sure you have everything in order. Check your pockets. Don't let others distract you or her from your rendezvous. Don't rush.

 * Don't delve into the affairs of a woman's life in search for a solution, just let her vent and listen. She's talking to you to vent, [she don't wanna be saved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJn87TkZF38). Bite your tongue if you have to. 

 * Women and clueless men think this mating ritual process 'just happens'. My ass. It's methodical. You have to think two steps ahead and make the next move. She won't do it for you. Get creative if you have to and be persistent. 

 * Always ask about her logistics in the middle of your session, not towards the end when she gets drunk and things become out of your control and can't close. Driving a girl home is a perfect excuse to go into her place. 

 * If she's hot, is over ~23-25, she has a kid, guarantee. Guys have been busting nuts inside her since she was in 9th grade, maybe earlier, like nature intended. One of those sperm was bound to find its place. Expect it. 

 * Remember her dancing in the kitchen? This a female tactic. They put themselves in a position to receive male escalation attempts and see what happens. They don't think further than that much of the time. It's your job to identify this and make a move.

876,1sms6j,"I've always said that the one group of people who truly take away women's agency are feminists. Why? Because it has forced the concept of ""womanhood"" into being *one* thing only: like a man. 

On the other hand, TRP *recognizes*, *accepts* & then takes *advantage* of the true nature of women. We don't try to change it. *""Omgz but you guyz hate womyn!!!""*. We may not find some of the things women do enjoyable, but we still accept them (no matter how hard; that's why swallowing the TRP for some is difficult) and learn to game the system to get laid. We overcome anything we may find annoying in them and we *plow forward*. What a novel concept: recognizing & then ignoring the shit you don't like (instead of whining about like feminists) and still getting what you want in the end.

Most of all, we encourage *true* femininity (in the biological sense) and don't try to redefine women as men. Leaders, breadwinners, independent, directly competitive/challenging, solely-focused. Those characteristsics are not feminine, no matter how you look at it, and no woman should be forced to be that *if she doesn't want to*. On the other hand, if she does want to, then good for her. But I sure as hell don't have to call her ""beautiful"", make an effort to sleep with her, or even talk to her. Stop saying I do. 

As for women who sleep around, cheat, lie to their bfs & are selfish, we certainly post lots of crap about them and criticize that behavior (does anyone praise liars?). But ultimately, we as men *must* recognize it's a dog-eat-dog world and we're not entitled to keeping our pussy on a leash. Instead, we take care of our shit, and *that* is what keeps our pussy coming back for more. On the other hand, mainstream culture will slut-shame any woman who *chooses* on her own to give it up ""easy"" to a guy. Her choice, don't judge or find someone for yourself to fuck. Yet tell that to the feminist at the bar who got left alone standing with her gin+tonic. Here in TRP, sluts are good. Show me a ""slut"" and I'll show you a girl I take to my bed and actually spend time on. Just I am not spending *all* my time on her, unless she earns it.

Lastly, feminism needs to recognize the cognitive dissonance it promotes in women. And men. It encourages masculine traits in girls (and them shames them if they don't accept) and promotes masculinity as a pathology in boys who don't know any better. No, that little boy isn't some ADHD mental case to be shunned just because he is solely focused on mechanical things and isn't interested (or good at) group presentation projects in home economics class. Boys and girls learn differently.

Finally, I would like to leave you all with a quote from ""The Devil's Advocate"" regarding TRP's view towards women (with the genders switched to reflect my point):

> I cared about what she wanted and I never judged her. Why? Because I never rejected her, in spite of all her imperfections! I’m a fan of women! I’m a feminist. Maybe the last feminist.

IamGale here, the 22-year old hypothetical multimillionaire psych and marketing guy. 

I was hired to help the local youth community centre find qualified youth workers. And I have a story for your about the big mistakes people made in these interviews...

The bar was set so low… 

Even if you had no experience working with youths, if you avoided the mistakes below you could have gotten a job here. It was ridiculous. The pay was £23,000/year which is good for the entry-level position. 

Today, I’m going to show you the mistakes three candidates made in their interview and how you can avoid them. I'll also show you one technique that dramatically increases your chances of getting your dream job. And my personal story of using it.

#9 Mistakes These Candidates Made In Their Interview

Something about a community centre draws the most interesting candidates. I'm going to tell you the story of three wholly different people. We had:

- An Italian Sexologist
- A Prison Social Worker
- An Ex-Lawyer turned Hospice Carer

The interviews are in a small room. Including me, there are 6 interviewers all asking questions to the candidates. Our first application is the Italian Sexologist.
He's got a hipster haircut and an interesting interviewing strategy.

#**Mistake #1: Not Backing Up Esoteric Knowledge**

Mr. Italian Sexologist starts immediately leveraging his academic background. He talks about how he has rare in-depth knowledge of Sexology. How he’s a trained and qualified sexologist. And starts dropping esoteric academic terms.

A few board members are impressed by this. But the chairman digs deep and he has trouble backing up his claim. The DHV fails. It might have been because of his bad English, but it didn’t leave a good impression.

**Fix: Clearly explain your esoteric knowledge or else it’ll look like BS**

#**Mistake #2: Not Engaging the Panel of Interviewers**

The interview continues and Mr. Italian makes another big mistake. He only engages the person that asked him the question. As there are 6 people here, the other 5 start to get really bored. At the end of the interview, only 1 out of the 6 liked him. Connect to everyone.

**Fix: Don’t solo in on one person, engage everyone.**

#Mistake #3: Telling Boring Stories 

He gives boring stories. In interviews, your employers want to hear how you’ll make their company even better, save them money, and build their reputation. To discern this, they ask you questions. Questions where you answer with fascinating stories of how you made your company better, saved them money, and built their reputation are what they want!

This guy desperately needed a storytelling 101 class. In University, my favourite class that I ever took was a beginner intro to screenwriting. Mostly because the professor was an acclaimed Hollywood writer that made every class fascinating. Now at interviews, I tell exciting stories that draw everyone in. 

Mr. Italian Sexologist told stories that were flat and boring.

**Fix: Tell exciting stories about how you improved your company.**

#**Mistake #4: Not Using Anyone's Names**

The Italian Sexologist also didn't use anyone’s name… This is so important. Obviously, since there are 6 people it’s a challenge but do not move on until you’ve remembered each person’s name. Out of all the three candidates, none of them did this. It's a big deal. Each time I asked the interviewee a question I used his name. It helps them pay attention to your question. Dale Carnegie in How to Win Friends and Influence people makes this his #1 rule.

**Fix: Use your interviewer’s name.**

#**Mistake #5: Have Jeb Bush Low-Energy**

No, we’re talking about the prison social worker. While she had an excellent interview overall, it could have been better. Her mistake was that she entered with very low energy. It was like what I imagine what it's like to talk to Jeb Bush.

And she refused to take off her coat… Very odd, but halfway through the interview she warms up and nails it. And because she went after the Italian sexologist, she looked like an All-Star when really she was just okay.

**Fix: Come in with high energy.**

#**Mistake #6: Fail to Smile and Be Friendly**

Now we’ve come to the Ex-Lawyer. This guy should have been the best candidate but he made some dumb mistakes that made him almost lose the job. He was the smartest, hardest working candidate. He was 6’4, jacked, ex-rugby captain, upper-class background with a law degree.

His big mistake was that he was so stoic. He never smiled. And because he was so big, he physically scared the interviewers. I’m great at picking up on body language but you didn’t have to be an expert to notice this. Hardly anyone but me would actually look at the guy if he wasn’t talking to you. 

**Fix: Smile and be friendly, aloofness works for girls but not for interviews**

#**Mistake #7: Be Monotone**

Now the Ex-lawyer is also monotone. He’s hard to listen to. And this big scary guy is also boring. That’s a bad combination.

**Fix: Use vocal variation in your interview answers to keep your audience interested.**

#**Mistake #8: Make Your Potential Boss Look Bad**

The ex-lawyer out alpha’d the director. This is a huge mistake. That why Robert Greene wrote in the 48 laws of power, that law #1 is to never outshine the master. His law background, his accomplishment, his physical presence, made the director look like a skinny beta loser.

And the director did not like this. He was really against hiring the guy because he felt so outdone and maybe a little emasculated around him. No one wants to hire someone who makes you look bad. So make sure to position yourself below your interviewer.

This was why he almost didn’t get hired. But another smart director and I realized this guy’s potential and helped convinced the other director to get him hired.

**Fix: Compliment the director and position him above you**

#Mistake 9: Too Vanilla

You fail to polarize yourself. This one is counter-intuitive but you want to show your interviewers that you’re different. You want to make them remember you amongst all the other candidates.

I learned this from Peter Thiel in his book, Zero to One. He writes that this is his favourite interview question is this:

>“What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”

This always gets good answers from candidates. But bad answers will sink your case. For instance, The Italian Sexologist answered that he believes that it’s bad to spread false information about sex. I inquired further but he couldn’t give any specific examples...

Whereas the prison social worker said she heavily believed in the law of attraction. And the ex-lawyer said he believed that moderation is the underrated way to succeed in life and gave good examples from his life as a career-driven lawyer.

**Fix: Believe in something slightly controversial (context is everything, cherry-pick your answers for your audience).**

#How to Nail Every Interview: The Briefcase Strategy

This is a game changer. And it creates the best impression in all your interviewers. I learned this from Ramit Sethi and this is probably some of his best advice.

[Watch his video explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=19&v=68dqa_IPqK8)

Here’s the gist:

The context is that you’re about to go in for your first interview. They’re trying to get a feel for you. And eventually, they ask you think the company should do differently to increase sales or accomplish their objective.

This is the moment where the magic happens.

Instead of going into a long monologue, you pull out a 2-6 page report detailing exactly everything you would do for the company.

This WOWS your interviewer. I’m sure some redpillers can testify to this if they’ve used this or seen it. I’ve used this for every interview I’ve had for the past year and it’s magical.

The briefcase strategy works because it shows you’re prepared to help the company succeed. And you’ve clearly thought about how to do it.

But with this approach, there’s one mistake you must avoid. I say that because I made this mistake and it cost me the job.

#**The Big Mistake I Made When Using the Briefcase Strategy**

Now this is an advanced mistake, that no one even attempted at the interview. But it's important to know when you start using this.

I was applying for two different marketing jobs. I used two polar opposite strategies and I learned a lesson that I’ll never forget.

The first one I walk in. I’m quite good at interviews because I’m great with small groups in private settings. I use lots of eye-contact. Use their name. Engage everyone. Tell good stories. I’m quite good. I delight them with  marketing campaign proposals tailored to their business. But there are some mistakes you can’t forgive… Because at the end of the day, they want to know you’ll make them more money.

**Company #1:**

The interview is going really well. But I make an embarrassing mistake. I tell them I’ll increase their email list by 100 subscribers in the first month. Even thinking about this hurts because they were probably growing their email list by 50 new people just organically. So to invest thousands of dollars in a new worker with that little return would be an awful investment for them.

But for some reason, I thought I had to be conservative about my first-month results to not disappoint them if I didn't meet my quota. But that's useless if I didn't get the job.

Good marketing is making the **BOLD** promises and doing everything you can to keep those promises. So I didn’t get the job, but I fixed this mistake for my next interview.

**Company #2:**

Here’s how I fixed this in the next interview:

I entered with boldness. I title my whole marketing campaign for them, “How I’ll Double Your Revenue.” Obviously, that was very optimistic but they loved it. And I got the job. I still freelance for them today.

**Fix: Make BOLD promises to improve the company**

*****

#Lessons Learned:

Interviews are easy. They come down to being confident and showing your interviewer why hiring you will be the best decision they’ve made in the last year. No one’s perfect and we all get nervous. For some highly competitive jobs, you need to be on your game and really practice before hand. For others, if there’s low competition and you kill it. Simply avoid the mistakes I’ve listed and use the briefcase strategy--you will easily be the favoured candidate. To sum it all up.

**1. For Interviews do this:**

1. Back up esoteric knowledge
- Engage everyone
- Your stories should centre on how you helped improved your previous company
- Use your interviewer’s name
- Come in with High Energy
- Smile and be friendly
- Use vocal variation in your answers
- Don’t outshine the master
- Be selectively controversial


**2. Use the Briefcase Strategy: bring in a written report on what you'll do to improve the company the interview.**

**3. Make Bold Promises.**

Okay this is a little off the normal topic of things. But i was suggested to post about it by one of the mods. and let's face it lifting is such a main focus on this sub that it's stupid not to think some guys aren't going to want to try gear or at least be curious. I'm not condoning the use of steroids especially if it is not legal where you live or without doctor supervision, natty is always the better and safer way to go. This is strictly for education purposes and my personal experience. I have used gear and also couch others on it. You wouldn't believe the lack of knowledge and research people have on the topic. Especially guys who jump right in and do everything wrong without any research. If run properly you can have great benefits especially at an older age and run as TRT (testosterone replacement therapy). I'm going to get really basic with this just to inform people who are curious but have little to no knowledge. 

**Word of knowledge** 

Everyone's body is different. One compound may give me great results while another may give you all side effects. 

With that being said, this is mostly a trial and error of what works best for YOU in particular. The reason I say this is because when I first started I wanted the perfect cycle. The problem is everyone's ""perfect cycle"" is different. And if you search the Internet on this stuff. Your head will explode because 100 people will tell you a 100 different ways to run something. And the way you're doing it is wrong and their way is right. But you don't know shit about these people or what they look like. So listen to your body. And know that  more isn't always better. 

**Basic as it gets**

Although this is a very broad topic I'm going to try to educate you as best as I can without bombarding you with every little detail. Pretty much an ELI5 without giving my personal opinion too much. 

Injecting. make sure you learn proper and safe sterile techniques. But injecting is the way to go. If you are planning on just taking orals. I would say don't waste your money. Because you will lose everything almost as soon as you stop. And it is very hard on the liver to run for long periods of time. 

Although I said everyone's perfect cycle is different. The best and safest first cycle IMO. Is just taking a low dose of testosterone. A low dose would be about 250-300mg a week. Most guys run 500-600mg their first cycle.  The right way is to try to maximize off the lowest amount possible. 

Testosterones have different esters. This means how long they take to leave the body once absorbed. Short esters hold less water, long esters hold more but allow you to inject a lot less. A longer ester is a better choice for your first cycle. Longer esters include test Cypionate and test enanthate. They take about 4 weeks til you really start to notice what you're working with. But you will gain weight with in the first couple weeks. Mostly water weight 

**Labs and A.I.s** 

You should always get bloodwork done. Before your cycle to see what your normal levels are. 6 weeks in to see how you're reacting to the drugs. And after you stop to see how long it takes for your levels to return to normal. 

A.I.s are aromatase inhibitors they are used to keep your estrogen levels at bay. When you put synthetic test into your body your test levels will obviously rise. The testosterone then converts into estrogen. So you will have high estrogen. Because of this you should always run a mild A.I. Like arimadex  about 2 weeks into your cycle to keep your estrogen at bay. This will prevent estrogen sides and bloating. And Just because you don't experience high estrogen sides (gyno aka man boobs) doesn't mean you don't have high estrogen. 

Aromasin and letrozole (strongest) are stronger A.I.s they actually kill estrogen in the body. You need some estrogen but you don't want it too high or at 0. That is why arimadex is usually used first. If you start to get high estrogen sides. Like sensitive nipples. It's smart to try a stronger A.I. 

**HCG** 

Human chorionic gonadotropin

Should be taken during you cycle also. This prevents your body from shutting down its natural test production. The old school way was to run it in your post cycle. But it's better to run it during and after. It's more of preventing your balls from shutting down (especially if you want kids) then Recovery from them being shut down and running it just post cycle. 

**PCT**

Post cycle therapy 

The name of the game is time on = time off. The amount of time you spend on cycle is the same amount of time you should spend off to allow your body to recover. Most cycles last 12-16 weeks. Sometimes longer. Sometimes sorter. It's all preference.  

A good post cycle therapy is running nolvdex. Clomid. And hcg. 

These drugs allow the body to recover. By kick starting your balls to produce test naturally again and preventing estrogen sides. 

They also allow your body to help maintain what you have worked so hard for. 

Some guys especially over the age of 40 never come off test and do a pct. they do what is called ""blasting and cruising"" blasting would be upping their test dose and/or adding other compounds. Cruising would be considered as their ""time off"" but instead of coming off they just lower their test dose to about a 250mg a week dose (varies). As you get older your testosterone naturally declines so men use this as a test replacement therapy for their natural test (where the term TRT comes from). This is also known to have many good health benefits. 

**other compounds**

After you have ran a cycle of just test one or two times and you have no adverse effects you can add in other compounds. There are a variety of them that all do different things. Have different benefits and sides. It's smart to only add one in at a time so if you have an adverse effect you know exactly what is causing it. 

Orals are usually used to kick start a cycle or end one, because of how fast they are in and out of the body. Most of them are hard on the liver but are very effective. 

Steroids although most of them speed up your metabolism. They do not directly burn fat like most people thing. You may lose fat but it isn't their main purpose. Diet is still very very important when taking steroids. I know guys who run all types of Shit and look worst than most natty guys. Genes, diet, and training play a major major role in how good your results are. They allow you to recover fast and better utilize the food you put in your body. But they are no super magic pill like society programs us to believe. You still need to put in the work and diet. You can get away with more than someone who doesn't use. But you can still look like Shit if you don't bust your ass. 

Fat burners are compounds such as DNP, clen, t3 and t4. These compounds are used to burn fat and have no direct effect on muscle growth really. 

**wait as long as you can to go this route**

It's very bad for your body to start running roids at 18 years old. Allow your body to fully develop and reach your natural potential before thinking about trying this stuff. If you are looking to compete this is eventually a route you're probably going to have to take but wait as long as you can to do it. 

I hope this gives you some idea of what is involved in a cycle. Like I said there's a lot of information out there in it. This is the very very basic. Do your research and consult your doctor before taking anything. 

Edit:

It is also good to note that just taking orals alone is probably a waste of your money you are likely to lose almost everything once you have stopped taking them.

**-Dad**

***

I was 5 when I threw sand in some girl's face in retaliation (she threw sand in mine.) She started crying.

The girl's dad, an unemployed welfare hick, came to the fence separating our property-

*""I'm gonna come over this fence and beat your son's ass!""*

My dad is standing in front of me-

**""If you come over that fence, I'll rip your fucking head off and shit down your windpipe.""**

I remember the look on my dad's face- determination, his eyes wide but fierce, almost crazy in fact. His jaw was locked, his fist clinched whilst I clung to his leg. He looked lethal- like a gun ready to go off. 

The guy never did come over that fence.

***

Growing up, I was scrawny and weak. Picked on, and half the time I deserved it. Big mouth, annoying, weird. I would stick up for my friends and promptly get the shit kicked out of me. I didn't even put up a good fight. The most damage I ever did to another person was a bite on the leg after being jumped by three kids. When I opened my swollen eyes to see why the punches stopped after I sunk my teeth in, I looked up to see that the person I bit was the adult who came to my rescue the house over. I bit the guy who saved me.

***

3 years ago, I signed up at a BJJ gym. I put my time in. I left that gym and signed up for an MMA gym 2 years ago. I'm now one of the instructors at my gym.

I convinced my step brother to sign up 6 months ago. ""Don't you want better for yourself?"" I asked him. He signed up.

4 months ago, whilst he's lifting weights, he sees a girl who's also lifting and wrestling. She has muscles in all the right places. Fit, pretty, HB8 by my standards but an SMV of 4. He tells another gym-mate, ""Who is that? She's pretty!""

The person he told was one of the amateur fighters at our gym. He is unemployed and is all-in on his, so far, lackluster fighting career. He's 24, this is it for him.

He's also the boyfriend of this girl.

*""That's my fucking girlfriend.""*

My step brother apologizes, tells him he didn't know, and steers clear of both thereafter.

***

2 months ago- I'm coming out of the gym and invite one of my gym-mates out to pizza with my step brother.

AmateurFighter overhears.

*""Hey bro, I like pizza! Also, you have a step brother?""*

I smile, and respond-

**""Yeah, my step brother is __!""**

He frowns, and gets a serious look on his face.

""*Oh, that fucking guy! Why hasn't he been coming to the gym to get fucked up? Tell him I'm looking for him.""*

I smile again, throwing warmth in my eyes and using a higher tone than I'd care to-

**""Oh, he's injured and has been taking a break. But no worries on the whole girlfriend thing, I handled it and now he knows!""**

""*Tell him I'm looking for him.""* He repeated.

**""Well bud, don't look too hard!""** I responded with a smile, before driving away.

***

I'm sitting at the pizza place with my step brother. We're going over RP truths. I believe we were talking about value and physical fitness. I was theorizing how sexual strategy was a two sided coin, you can either game women through subterfuge or you could be skilled enough to physically challenge your competition. Either should, in theory, give women the tingles.

I look over to my step brother, and I tell him about what had transpired at the gym before I came to the pizza parlor. AmateurFighter had injured 2 other fighters over the years over perceived slights against his relationship, he had made many more threats. He had a reputation. He had pushed one of the instructors over an alleged *leer* towards his girlfriend.

**""Don't worry, brother. You're family. I have your back.""** I was thinking back upon my father's old saying: he had just gone to the hospital again the day prior. There was no guarantee he would make it at this time.

**""You and my dad are all I have in this world.""** I thought back to my dad's words. I had nothing to lose, all I could think about was my father and how close I was to losing him. 

I see a familiar car pull up in the parking lot.

AmateurFighter had arrived, uninvited.

My step brother becomes apprehensive- *""oh shit.""* He says with some concern.

**""Don't worry, I'll handle it.""** I assure him.

AmateurFighter throws open the door. His gait is with purpose, his face has the look of a man looking for a fight. He doesn't even look at me, his eyes are fixated on my step brother.

I smile, add warmth to my eyes, I throw my hands out and say in a high voice, **""hey, AmateurFighter! I don't remember inviting you!""**

No acknowledgment. He comes up behind my step brother, he forcefully places his hand on the nape of his neck. He leans in, *""hey man, you said something pretty disrespectful about my girlfriend-""*

I shot out of the seat in a flash. I knocked over the tables and chairs. I secured a cross-collar grip on his jacket with my forearm against his throat. I pushed him against the wall.

**""This isn't the fucking place for that.""** I growled, my voice resuming it's natural deep Bass that I normally hide. My eyes bore into him with a wild-eyed look, not unlike my father's back in the day.

He threw his hands up. His eyes darted around in visible fear. He didn't respond, he didn't move. His eyes never met mine throughout the exchange.

**""If I wanted you here, I would've given you a fucking invite. Now get the fuck out of here.""** I finished. 

The staff rushed over, attempting to separate us. It was like time stood still. The whole room had been enveloped in my frame. I released him and the staff proceeded to escort him out, threatening police. I proceeded to sit back down to finish my pizza and beer, and continue my conversation with my step brother. In spite of me being asked to leave, the staff didn't push the issue and I remained unmolested for the rest of the night.

I looked over to my step brother and clasped his hand with mine. I looked him in the eye-

**""You had my word that I had your back.""**

**""One day, I may need you stand for me, much like I did for you today. I may become injured and weak""**

**""That guy won't let this go. His ego won't stand for it. So you better learn how to defend yourself, because I won't always be around.""**

**""But lucky for you, and unlucky for him, I was here. He put his hand on the stove and he got burned.""**

He acknowledges this, and we finish talking about TRP without further issue.

***

As I walk out, I see the AmateurFighter and the gym-mate I had invited earlier hanging out down the ways, waiting for us to leave. I expected the worst.

**""Get in the car and leave, bro.""** I command. He reluctantly obliges, still mindful of his injuries from the week previous during training.

I walk over to the group. I felt relaxed but wound-up. I was calm and I had a sense of certainty. Fear, something I would normally feel when I was younger, was strangely absent.

I felt lethal, but I was also mindful that I needed to be functional for my dad's sake. Regardless, in my mind, there was only one way this situation would go if it came down to it.

AmateurFighter starts talking.

*""Dude, ketogainsmongoose, I'm sorry. I came here to talk to you!""*

**""Don't bullshit me, AmateurFighter, you came here looking to cause problems for my step brother. You put his hands on him. You simply expected me to stand by, but you put your hand on the stove and got burned, now you're trying to pretend you weren't here to fuck him up.""**

*""He disrespected my girlfriend! She doesn't know what just happened in there! I asked her if she was offended, and she said yes! I asked if she wanted an apology, she said yes! I was just gonna have him come outside and apologize to her!""*

**""Bullshit. You came in with anger on your face and in your heart. You put your hands on him. You violated man's law. You disrespected me by coming here.""**

*""But I thought you invited me!""*

**""How the hell would you figure that?""**

*""You said 'don't look too hard!' that wasn't an invite?""*

I laugh.

**""You're an idiot. That was a threat. I was trying to hint to you to back the fuck off.""**

*""But my girlfriend wanted an apology!""*

**""Fuck your girlfriend, and fuck her apology.""**

I see a shadow move in the passenger side of his car. The girlfriend has been sitting in the car this whole time, listening to this exchange, without me realizing it.

***

I walked away unmolested that night. In a fit of rage, AmateurFighter had confronted our coach, the owner, at the gym over another issue regarding the girlfriend ""being harassed."" This time she alleged that she was 'touched' inappropriately by another instructor and waited a week to report it. A view of the cameras inside proved the allegation was false. When Coach told him as much, AmateurFighter pushed him to the ground.

The coach, knowing what had transpired with me and AmateurFighter the week before, banned both AmateurFighter and his girlfriend, and threatened him with police.

Some amongst the viewership question the authenticity of the field reports and stories posted on TRP as of late.

I'm here to tell you why you're simply a pussy-ass bitch who deserves your boring, uneventful, unfulfilling life.


Every single day, opportunities present themselves for you to drop the facade and be a man. Here it comes! Your chance to actually have something *unbelievable* happen in your life! A situation that would make your friends shake their heads in disbelief and say, ""bullshit, I don't believe you!""

And every single time, you choke.

You see other men, being men, and rationalize it as bullshit. Because the bitter truth, that you're simply a coward, is too hard for you to swallow.

You hamster away opportunities to show the world and yourself what you're made of.

""I need this job.""

""It's not worth the hassle.""

""Karma will get him.""

""One day, he'll mess with the wrong guy.""

""He's not worth it.""

""He's just lucky I can control my temper.""

""If *insert ideal conditions here* then I'd show him!""

You're just a pussy That's all there is to it. You're afraid to speak your piece because you're afraid of all the things you'd lose in your life.

Your job.

Your house.

Your bills.

Your car.

Your girlfriend.

Your wife.

Your kids.

And on and on it goes.

Those who would trade their self-respect for security, will neither be safe nor will they receive respect.

If you can't stand up to the random petty Tyrants riddled along your path in life, how the hell are you supposed to stand up for yourself when it matters?

If you don't take a stand now, you'll never catch up to those who trudged along, ignoring the crabs that attempted to pull them down.

Stop being a crab. Start being a man. Get your ass out of the house and stand for something.

Quit making excuses for why today just isn't the day to stand up for yourself.

If a man has enemies, that's good! It means he actually stood for something in his life.

If you're tired of looking in the mirror and seeing a doormat, dig in your heels and start being a man for a change.

Go out there and live life.

Saying you're going to a fraternity meeting is orders of magnitude more acceptable and low-key that using all the PUA and TRP community lingo that can set off red flags in people who are still plugged in. 

Ultimately I want to create local chapters around the country for men who have like-minded ideals and have taken the red pill to be able to experience the kind of camaraderie I enjoyed in my military and PUA days. 

And on that note, one of the main causes of me wanting to do this was when Meetup decided in their infinite wisdom to start deleting all of the PUA groups that had sprung up over the years. Having an official fraternity is under the radar in a variety of ways and I think long term will legitimize red pill philosophy and give it a push to becoming more mainstream as our philosophy spreads openly in the public, even if we don't call ourselves Red Pill or use familiar terms.

Why? Because tradcon values are none of these things, they are shit, they always were shit, and it's very easy for slaves to replace one master with another. Tradcons do not give a shit about your welfare. They are just fighting with feminism over who gets to hold your leash.

When feminism first came along, why the men buy into it? 

Because they thought it would free them. They thought that the chains would be struck from their own natural and healthy sexual appetites if only women were ""liberated"" to be sluts. Why would they have gone for that, if they were already free and happy?

No, tradcons may [hate feminism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw1lthwHn9U) and [cultural Marxism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbDggKqt3KA), but **The enemy of your enemy is not your friend. He is your enemy's enemy, nothing less and nothing more.**

Call me a fucking loser, but that advice isn't the same as advice I'd give a legally responsible adult - but I'm an asshole for it. Well, so be it. I stand by my advice and you guys can suck a dick, because If you had sons, I'd HOPE your advice to them when they're in school isn't ""Screw your education! Get as much pussy as possible!"".** /end rant.

I've been seeing a lot of posts here from younger guys asking how to ""get the girl"" or ""be more alpha"", because they don't have success with girls, and see other ""more successful"" guys getting steady GFs or having sex at parties. 

In order to help you, you need to understand some things, so I'm going to lay them out for you. 

 * You're a teenager. Your body is flooded with hormones. You get uncomfortable random boners. You can't study because the girl next to you has her thong riding up on her hip. You feel forever alone and you know that having a girlfriend (or even just getting laid) will make your life 100% better. Why? Because your biology is overriding your brain and putting pussy on the pedestal for you. Being a man means reigning in those urges and taking control of your feelings and not becoming a slave to them. All men go through being sex-craving teenagers - it's a normal state of growth, but don't let it define you or set your priorities.

 * Girls are NOT a big mystery. They have even **more** insecurities than you do. They bleed out their vaginas for up to a week per month. They get shit for being too fat, not following the herd and they have low self-esteem and body issues. However bad you think **your** situation is, be lucky you're a guy. Girls your age are fickle, bitchy, shallow and superficial. Unless you're one of those guys who already gets female attention, don't waste your time chasing them - girls your age are a bad / risky investment. Instead, focus that energy on your studies. Women will always be there - what's the rush? The last thing you want is some chick's drama twisting you up or becoming a babydaddy at your age. 


 * You live in an artificial bubble. Your life **now** is not representative of what life is like after school - not even close - it's like life with training wheels on. Right now you if you fail a class people will offer you guidance, assistance and resources that you can use to dig yourself out of a hole. You're protected. Out in the world, you're thrown to the wolves and have to get by on your own wits and merits - nobody cares if you succeed or fail. The things you **think** are important now (going to prom, getting invited to parties, making out with chicks) are going to be trivial and in a few years you're going to look back and laugh on the huge importance you placed on those things. Your situation is temporary. You will change. Life will change you. 

 * You feel powerless because you are subjected to the rules others impose on you (parents, teachers etc.). This doesn't change much when you're an adult. You're still subject to the law and your boss. You will still need to follow some rules. But you will also be able to make some rules for yourself, and you can start now. You might be a fat kid who isn't in control of your family's diet, but you can control how much you eat and you can ask for a weight set or lift weights at school or join a sport. You might be a shy kid with no friends, but you can join a speech or debate club and hone those skills. You might be awkward around girls, but you can join the drama club, where you get to interact with them directly. There are things you can do to improve yourself right now - take advantage of the resources available to you. Playing video games for five hours a night will do absolutely nothing for your future. 

 * Things will get better. Girls start at the top of the hill and coast down until they run out of steam. Men stand at the bottom of the mountain and see how far they can climb. Your value will appreciate as you gain wealth, status and self-improve. Your appearance will change. Your acne will go away. A woman's prime attractiveness is her looks, her youth and her fertility. Your prime attractiveness are your looks, resources and status, and if you lack in one you can still have success if you excel in the others. This is why you need to study your ass off, get good grades and invest in your future - because in fifteen years the good looking jock who peaked in high school will be stuck selling used cars while the bookworm who had career goals is pulling six figures. Women are a by-product of success - if you're successful **they** will be drawn to **you**, and you haven't even come **CLOSE** to hitting your prime. Work on securing your financial future. Do that by hitting the books and making good grades. 

Re-prioritize your shit - try not to think with your dick. Girls your age are attracted to hotter, older guys or guys who other girls think are hawt (herd mentality). High school is nothing like real life, so what happens to you now socially is inconsequential. You have a lot of control over how you end up, and forming good habits now will help you tremendously later. You are so far from being at peak value, both time-wise and who you are as a person, that it's not even worth worrying about. Work on your grades and set your goals now. Your journey hasn't even started yet - this is just the warm-up. ",883,2.0,0.29019999504089355,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck"
884,2bowat,"Not pussyfooting around this one.  Title is literal. 

If anything could ever be classified as a Feminist's Nightmare, it's the irreconcilable notion that women are extremely aroused at the thought of being able to make a high value man so lustful that he loses control and has to have her.  Many women have struggled with this concept.  Some have cleverly come up with positive terminology to deflect from the dissonance; they'll use terms like ""ravishment"" to doll it up, as if simply assigning a new word takes away from the reality of what's going on.

Here in TRP we do not shy from these realities.  What goes through a woman's head when she contemplates being ravished is that she is of such high SMV that men lose their control just to have her.  This is a level of validation few women get to truly experience.  The male equivalent would be a pair of beautiful women demanding that you have a threesome with them.  

I've no doubt this type of post causes SJW's to froth at the mouth, but their impotent rage doesn't invalidate reality.  Consider the success of 50 Shades of Grey.  The basic synopsis is that a powerful, rich, alpha man completely lusts and forcefully dominates a perfectly boring average woman.  You'd think this banal concept would only sell to a fringe that gets off on this kink, but the book sold **70 million copies** in 8 months.  That's more than any Harry Potter novel.  And now that the movie is out I guarantee it will be a box-office hit.  Let women scream and ""Wow, just wow"" at you all they want -- their words mean nothing in relation to their actions.  Women want to be taken by force by a high value man.

So when is it rape instead of ravishment?  Aside from obvious cases of drugging someone or having sex with the unconscious (for the feminazi retards: **No one here condones these instances of legitimate rape**)  the difference is strictly in the disparity of your SMV's.  The stranger-in-the-bush is often characterized as some seedy low-life thug.  This evokes intense fear.  Being forcefully held down in bed by the muscular CEO of a Fortune 500 company does not evoke this fear.  No woman alive is comfortable by the idea that she enjoys rape, so she needs to reframe it.  Be aware of that.

So how does the average TRP'er benefit from this?  If you're already sexually active with a woman, discuss the concept of a safeword.  Even though women love the idea of being taken, there's always the chance that she may be in one of those emotional frames where she genuinely isn't up for sex, this is a failsafe.  Once you've established that, next time you're looking to sexually escalate simply ignore her token attempts to refuse.  She turns her lips away from a kiss, you force her against a wall and take it.  She tries to push you off, you squeeze her.  You grab her and throw her onto the bed, then lay into her with your weight so she can't get away.  And so on.

Paradoxically this creates intense arousal and pair-bonding in women.  I encourage you to try this.  Of all the women I've had sex with only ~5% genuinely hated rough, aggressive sex.  The other 95% beg for more afterwards.

885,72iq6i,"**TL;DR**: Best friend invites a girl he was setup with to a festival this weekend with an extra ticket. I get salty because he was supposed to invite our bro instead. Karma gets him back and I end up sleeping with her instead despite having no intention of doing so.

## Story

A large festival just finished this weekend in my city and I had a great time. Cool music, incredible art, and good vibes all around. Sorry for the length but I'm cross-posting this to a FB group so I wanna make sure those guys get the full story haha.

### Saturday

Saturday night I went with my best friend and one of his plates. He wanted to see some bands I didn't care about so I spent that whole night solo.

Wasn't trying to hook up with anyone, just wanted to enjoy the music and take in the atmosphere. Still, some girls were really digging my trippy glasses and I realized they'd be a great way to open girls and dance with them.

I ended up dancing with two smokeshows that night but couldn't make out with either of them. First one was really touchy so I thought she was into me but she wasn't feeling anything but dancing. Her friend was a lot more receptive but I missed my chance to try with her before they left. The other one just took my glasses and started dancing with me but she was also not into making out.

I can't really pinpoint where I fucked up but I didn't end up with anyone that night. It could've been that both girls had friends with them so maybe they didn't wanna leave their friends hanging or something. I even did the ""do you mind if I dance with your friend?"" line to involve the friends but I guess it didn't help.

Don't really care, still had a fun night regardless.

### Sunday

Sunday afternoon my best friend has an extra ticket since his plate couldn't go, so I tell him to invite one of our bros. I call our bro up and say we got tickets for him and he's super stoked to come with. Not even a minute after hanging up, my best friend says one of his buddies set him up with a girl, talking him up and everything, and to definitely invite her out with the extra ticket.

He calls our bro to give him the bad news and I get salty since now I look bad for calling him up just to cancel 2 minutes later. Still, I'm not gonna stay butt hurt about it so I just roll with it.

He leaves to pick up this girl and comes back a bit later. They both drop acid before we head out to grab some food at a local spot and here's where I start fucking up as a wingman. I'm in a no-fucks-given mood so I'm teasing the hell out of this girl, treating her like a child because she says a lot of stupid shit, but I'm also talking up my best friend and referencing some of the cool art stuff he does.

I'm a master of bullshitting and talking about literally anything so I start talking about ghosts with this girl and my bro and she's indulging me in my bullshit. Unfortunately I end up vibing more with the girl than my bro was so I pull my banter back a bit and let my bro kino to build rapport with her.

When we show up at the festival we go to the bathrooms and my friend goes ""I think you had that girl at the ghosts shit. Wouldn't be surprised if she ends up with you instead tonight."" I tell him I'm literally not even trying to do anything, I'm just being me and not paying any attention to her at all ... And then he says this girl apparently loves being treated like that. Oops.

I don't wanna cockblock my bro so I keep my distance and dance by myself for like an hour while I'm assuming he's trying to kino with her. After the artist's set, we walk to another stage and he says she's on her phone and not reciprocating to his kino at all.

To top it off ... This girl then says she wants to meet up with her _guy friend she met at another festival_ and tells us to come with her. My buddy was not having any of this so he keeps his frame and says ""no, we're gonna go watch [artist], you can come with us or go find your friend by yourself."" She didn't follow so my buddy says fuck it, we're still gonna have a great night.

We meet up with some of my fraternity brothers and have some fun dancing to some bangers. After an hour this girl texts my buddy asking where we are and where to meet her. At this point I'm sure they're both tripping hard on the acid so he goes to look for her to make sure she's okay. He doesn't find her so she texts me to come get her but I tell her I'm enjoying the set and she'll have to wait until it's done.

After the set she didn't text back when I asked where she was so I find my bro instead. We wanna find this girl since he feels responsible for her but she's not picking up or answering texts. I'm completely sober by this point but we find a friend who has Molly, so I say fuck it and take some.

We go to this LED blanket thing and the Molly hits me hard laying on the ground looking up at this thing. We see a group of hotties that are also tripping so we lay with them and let them try out the trippy glasses. I kiss one of the girls before they leave but now I wanna go see one of my favorite artists while I'm rolling that hard.

My bro didn't wanna go so I decided to go by myself to see the set. It was a great fucking experience while on Molly. Midway through the set I get a text from the girl saying to meet up at a landmark when the set is done. I tell her alright and continue having fun.

After the set I go find her and I have the sternest look on my face. She's happy I found her but I'm having none of that and go straight patriarch on her. I grab her face with my hands and scold her for running off on her own, straight up treating her like a child and saying she's gonna get punished for misbehaving. I see she's actually digging the scolding and grabs my face as well while smiling.

At this point I'm salty but I also feel great thanks to the Molly so I just start making out with her, periodically slapping her face saying I can't believe what a dumb bitch she is and telling her to tell me she's a dumb bitch. She eats it up.

I tell her we gotta find my buddy so we go walk to find him and she's all over me. We show up and she's holding my hand and my best friend has the most ""you gotta be shitting me"" look on his face hahahahaha. I tell him I'm sorry but the girl wasn't feeling him so I just stepped in. We end up walking to an after party where I kino this girl even more until we leave at 5am. We end up back at my buddy's but we're all still high so we watch a movie while we wait to come down.

I go use the bathroom real quick and come back to see my bro next to this girl hella cockblocking me (you fucker). I'm just thinking ""this motherfucker still hasn't given up!"" but I can tell she's not digging it and by this point I just wanna hate fuck this girl for what she pulled.

I say I'm gonna go home and sleep in my comfy bed and ask this girl to come with. She says yes and the rest is history.

## Final Thoughts

Suggestion to my bro since I know you're gonna read this: apparently you were too touchy with her when you met her and that kinda put her off a bit. I also noticed you came off with some scarcity body language since you didn't get to bang your plate the night before and you were really trying to get laid. Don't know if it was the acid but that's not usually how you are, was a little surprised by your actions and behaviors in some cases.

In any case, I didn't really do anything special here. I was just being myself, but this is now my default persona after 4 years of being exposed to TRP. I gave this girl no validation, treated her like a child, and she bent to my frame. Unlike my friend I also experienced no shit tests and no LMR whatsoever. I can tell she's a massive sloot ... But she does have hot friends so I might plate her to get access to her friends.

IamGale here, the psych and marketing guy, and surprisingly I’m not talking to you about psych or marketing...
Today we’re talking about money, specifically how you can become a millionaire. No inner game fluff talk. This post gives you all specific industries and tactics where millionaires are created. If you're in your 20s you'll find this very interesting. Imagine if you had a million dollars? Yea, we’re going there today.

#Why You Should Make as Much Money As Possible

Despite all the bullshit you hear, you should do everything in your power to get as much money as possible.

If there’s one problem you want, it’s too much money. If I had to choose, I’d rather be a rich beta bux than a broke chad. Money buys options.

I hate hearing stories about how rich people are the most miserable people in the world. Are they serious? They can pay for support, when you’re broke you don’t have anything. Being rich means you have the resources to help yourself and to help the world.

**Why traditional advice sucks**

You know what happens if you Google, “How to become a millionaire”?

You get bullshit results about the 7 habits of millionaires and how you should be reading and waking up at 5am...

But none of that advice is actually helpful in making you a millionaire. And I swear to God, I’ll kill you if you post in the comment that we should do surveys to make money...

We're talking about real money: Fuck You Money.

I’m talking about **building millionaire dollar assets** that you can sell one day. Millionaire fastlane style money.

This is the end goal:

You should have enough money to say whatever you want, do whatever you want, all with utter confidence because you know you can financially support yourself through anything.

There are so many benefits to having money. With money you can make other people happy. You can live anywhere you want. You get almost an unlimited number options available to you.

**But how do you make Fuck You Money?**

Yes, the concept is simple, add value. But it begs the question, what kind of value?

This post is going to be about the biggest opportunities out there for young men to make serious money. Please add your suggestions as well to the comments below for potential careers.

Before we start I want to give you real statistics on millionaires. Yes, it's very possible for you to become a millionaire if you work. In fact, most millionaires are first generation. Check out these statistics.

**Millionaire Statistics:**

* According to the book The Millionaire Next Door, only 20% of millionaires inherited their wealth. The other 80% earned their cash on their own. ^1
* Most modern American millionaires today (about 80%) are first-generation millionaires. ^1
* The average millionaire goes bankrupt at least 3.5 times ^1
* Only 20% of millionaires are retirees. Around 80% still go to work. ^1
* Half of all millionaires are self-employed or own a business. ^2


**Breakdown of Millionaires**

In the USA, according to highly successful entrepreneur & best-selling author Brian Tracy, here’s the breakdown of those who earn $1m annually:

* 74% – Entrepreneurs
* 10% – Highly Skilled Professional
* 10% – Corporate Executives
* 5% – Sales Professionals
* 1% – Rock Stars, Athletes, Lottery Winners, etc.

Notice how most millionaires are regular entrepreneur. You'll see shortly that finance is one of the best and safest industries to make a fortune but most millionaires you'll see are entrepreneurs.

Now we're I can show you the really good stuff. I spent a lot of time researching and linking this for you.

Below are industries in which I’ve read or heard of industries where people are making serious income. These are industries that you want to look into. The number one rule is always to follow the money.

Don’t look at how people say they’ve become millionaires. Look at what they’ve created. Normally this would take you hours to research, but I've already compiled some the best industries and markets for you to make money below.

#How to Make Fuck You Money

**1. Selling Courses Online**

By far the most common thing I see these days. Guys like Ramit Sethi, Derek Halpern, Brian Dean, Neil Patel, Udemy profs, are killing it in this space. These guys have 7 figure businesses just on selling $2000 courses.

All making millions of dollars. And Courses have some of the best margins of all time. Crazy industry right, especially as more and more millennial lose faith in College. And as relevant courses start to be exclusively online. For instance, there’s no University for SEO. Online is your best source for good information.

Examples:

* [Ramit Sethi: Real-World Blueprint for a $5-Million Week] (http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/03/04/5-million-week/)
* [Derek Halpern: How I Built A 7 Figure Business - Social Triggers](http://socialtriggers.com/exclusive/audience/)
* [Neil Patel: How I Built a 7 Figure SEO Agency](https://www.quicksprout.com/2013/01/10/how-i-built-a-seo-agency-to-7-figures-a-year/)
* [Udemy: Alun Hill](https://www.udemy.com/user/alunhill/) has a dozen udemy courses bringing him tons of money
* [Udemy: Rob Percival](https://www.udemy.com/user/robpercival/) hosts the best-selling programming courses
* [Nat Eliason: Making 53K from programming for marketers](http://www.nateliason.com/life-after-sumome/)

I believe selling courses online is one of the best-emerging markets out there for those who have something valuable to teach. There are several benefits to courses. You can charge very high price tags like Ramit Sethi ($2000+) and you can keep the same course running for years. So you create a recurring revenue. What the pros do is 4 times a year they open their courses to the public. So they create massive revenues for themselves. Even the pros on Udemy have a constant stream of revenue coming as new students sign up. Udemy takes around 50%, but you’re still making a lot of money.

**2. Affiliate Marketing**

Affiliate marketing is mostly about your traffic-generation skills. That's what you have to master as an affiliate. Once you do, you can drive traffic to high paying affiliate programs of your choice.

Here are some great examples:

* [Pat Flynn Income Report with 150k a month from affiliate marketing](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/my-january-2016-monthly-income-report/)
* [Matthew WoodWard Income Report with 12K per month from affiliate marketing](http://www.matthewwoodward.co.uk/income-report/monthly-income-growth-traffic-report-february-2016/)
* [EoFire Making 36K per month from affiliate marketing](http://www.eofire.com/income30/)
* [List of top earning blogs](http://onlineincometeacher.com/money/top-earning-blogs/)
* [Nichesiteazon making 3k/month](http://www.nichesiteazon.com/may-2015-income-report/)

Note: I’m having trouble finding public examples, but I know from first-hand experience that there a lot of SEO experts out there making 6 figure incomes from affiliate marketing in the health and gambling experience. It’s all about driving traffic to highly profitable niches like insurance, etc.

**3.Selling a Product to a Loyal Customer Base**

People either have great products or if they’re popular bloggers they leverage their fanbase and sell them stuff. Most famous bloggers are able to cash in on their fanbase with a product.

Examples:

* [Chris from Good Looking Loser on making 3 million in sales from his e-commerce business.](http://www.gll-getalife.com/get-paid/20-things-ive-learned-from-making-over-3-million-in-e-commerce-sales) If he sold that company he’d easily be a millionaire.
* [Victor Pride Making 10k/month 2013](https://boldanddetermined.com/how-i-make-10k-per-month-online/) that was 3 years ago, I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s making 5x that now.
* [Eofire making 500k from their freedom journal](http://www.eofire.com/income30/)

Most bloggers will sell information products, they’re high margin and don’t require updates like software. The biggest challenge is building a loyal audience and getting good traffic from Google.

**4. Sales for products of $5K to $500K value**

Selling medical equipment, industrial farming equipment, manufacturing equipment. Anything with a big price tag means you can get a big commission. Sales Salaries can be vary high and if you save well you can become a millionaire.

* [Medical Equipment Sales, Average salary is 153K in 2015 survey](https://www.medreps.com/medical-sales-careers/medical-equipment-sales-salary-report/)

Selling yachts and other expensive luxury/equipment items will net you great cash. I’d love if someone could post specific industries that are great for sales. Selling Solar Panels is also a great market to get into.

**5. Programming (Python, Swift, Javascript a good programmer is always in demand)**

Most programmers per se aren’t millionaires, but a lot of them who’ve created SAAS companies have become so. You also get an amazing salary if you work for a big tech company.

* [Working at Google in programming will net you anywhere from 100-160k per year](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Salary/Google-San-Francisco-Salaries-EI_IE9079.0,6_IL.7,20_IM759.htm)

**6.Finance (banking, Hedge Funds)**

This is the BIGGEST source of Millionaires according to [Wealth Insights] (http://www.lifehack.org/articles/money/the-top-industries-2014-that-created-millionaires.html). If you want to make do Finance. Despite the long hours, it’s your best bet.

* [Juniors make around 100-200k.](http://www.careers-in-finance.com/ibsal.htm)
* [Seniors make 200k-3M](http://www.careers-in-finance.com/ibsal.htm)

If you make it to a senior position as an investment banker you’ll be set for life. Out of all the options in this thread, this is where the most millionaires have been made in History.

**7. Virtual Reality Development**

VR is an emerging market. It’s a risk to jump in, but you might just make your millions here. For example, Palmer Lucky is worth 700M and he’s only 23… Obviously, it’s high risk, but if you’re into tech this might be the place for you to focus on.

* [Palmer Lucky’s Net Worth of 700M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Luckey)

I’m sure we’ll see more millionaires come from this market in the next couple years.

**8. E-commerce (Selling on Amazon or your own product on Shopify)**

There are tons of high earners from Amazon and selling products. When you get the #1 ranking spot on Amazon, as long you get 500+ reviews you can do really well.

* [Theamazingseller making 12k profit per month](http://theamazingseller.com/tas-042-income-report-april-2015-32559-06-amazon-fba-sales/)
* [Stephen Somers selling on Ebay and Amazon making 7 figure in revenue](https://mixergy.com/interviews/stephen-somers-turned-selling-stuff-amazon-art-form/)

**9. Real Estate**

Real estate has always been a place where people have made their fortune. Obviously, everyone thinks of Donald Trump, who’s now a billionaire from his real estate entrepreneurship. There’s also a lot of other brokers out there that are doing great:

* [Donald Trump with a net worth of 4-10 Billion](http://forbes.com/profile/donald-trump/)
* [Frederik Edlund, New York’s #1 Realtor worth 30M](http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/business-executives/fredrik-eklund-net-worth/)
* [Robert Ringer was making 1M/year through real estate, he outlines it in his amazing book](http://www.amazon.com/Winning-Through-Intimidation-Robert-Ringer/dp/0449207862)

**10. Flipping Land**

I’ve read that buying vacant land, splitting it and selling it a decent way to make money. There’s a good Reddit post on it [here](http://archive.is/O0EVz).

* [Check out this book for more information](http://www.amazon.com/The-Land-Flipper-Turning-Dollars-ebook/dp/B01CEZLS04)

Not sure if there have been millionaires, but I’ve read that it’s pretty good money. This part needs more information, though.

**11. SAAS Businesses**

Create a software as a service for a specific industry. Basically, most big tech companies are SAAS. Think of PayPal, Facebook, Twitter, Kickstarter, all the unicorns all started software businesses. But I want to focus on niche software, like lead pages, mail chimp, etc. There are also a ton of niche software that you don’t know about that make a lot of revenue.

* [Brightedge making 50M revenue](https://mixergy.com/interviews/jim-yu-brightedge/)

* [Hollis Carter selling software to school making $2M in revenue](https://mixergy.com/interviews/hollis-carter-velocity-interview/)
* [Wufoo selling for 35M](https://mixergy.com/wufoo-sold-for-35-mil-heres-the-story-behind-its-success/)

* [Marketo earning 210M/year](http://investors.marketo.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=954126)

So many millionaires have been made me in this sector. That’s why everyone always tells you to learn to program.

**12.Manufacturing**

I have a family member who became a millionaire in manufacturing. It’s niche but he started his own window frame manufacturing company. Had really great timing in the economy and now he’s one major window frame suppliers in North America. However, I think most manufacturing these days comes from China so I’d be weary of this industry.

* [Aakash Chemicals and Dye-Stuffs earning 40M in sales per year](http://eventualmillionaire.com/millionaire-story-aakash-shah/)


**13. Garbage and trash recycling.**

I can think of Brian Scudamore of  1-800 got junk. It’s a boring but necessary industry that no one wants to do. That’s usually a good sign. He’s worth 150M.

* [Brian Scudamore's 150M story](https://mixergy.com/interviews/brian-scudamore-1800gotjunk-interview/)

**14. Fashion**

Extremely difficult, but many founders of Zara and H&M have all become billionaires. Clothing is pretty high margin. However, a lot of entrepreneurs have tapped in niches to make really great revenues.

* [Nasty Gal Vintage Clothing earning 100M+](https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/nasty-gal-kills-it-ecommerce-how-they-did-it)

Energy is a very lucrative but risky business. Oil prices are doing awful right now, so it's not the best time to start your fracking company. 

EDIT: As everyone is mentioning in the comments, starting a fracking company is shitty way to make money right now...

Go out and enter an industry where Millionaires are actually made! It comes down to building million dollar assets that you can sell. For those interested in hearing more business case studies a great podcast to listen to is Mixergy. Andrew Warner often interviews very high earners and talks specifically about business, revenue, strategy. A lot of the examples from here are from Mixergy interviews.

Some info before I start:

I recently joined the pus.
I live on base.

I went to the gym on base earlier today and saw someone I hadn't seen in about 7 months. Suddenly I remembered something I thought was worth sharing:

7 months ago I graduated from the recruiting school and was officially a member of the military in my country (not the US if you're wondering). As part of the recruitment process we were assigned new living quarters and a new timetable, after many boring briefs, our last brief of the day was about our new PT (physical training) program.

We were sitting in a briefing cinema filled with 100 new sailors. Around 70 were men and about 30 women. Now, they all weren't HB10's, but most at least had slim, tight bodies due to the unrelenting physical training and controlled diet we had during our recruitment training, to say it plainly, they were all pretty bangable.

Suddenly I noticed the atmosphere changed in the room; people perked up and the loud chattering dulled to soft whispers, someone had walked in....

It was our physical trainer hosting the brief.

He was about 6'8"", had a chiseled jaw, golden hair and blue eyes, was jacked as fuck, golden tan, pearly whites, and had a tattoo sleeve. Now, I'm no closet homo, but I know an attractive man when I see one. This guy was pretty much a model thrown in military uniform.

Every women in the room audibly sighed. Every. Single. One.

To put it simply:

The brief was a train wreck. The poor guy just wanted to explain the timetable and be on his way, but was forced to  face a room of raised, thin-wristed hands - only leading to unrelated, and unrelenting sexual advances thinly-veiled as questions. You could have cut the sexual tension in the air with a butter knife.

I felt bad for a few of the guys in the room. During our 3 months of recruit training, some male and female members grew quite close and formed relationships. Some of those female members were already married, some to civilians some to *other military members*. 

My point being: There were few single women in that room, yet you could hear every vagina collectively gushing like it was niagra falls.

Female hypergamy is very, very real.

These women didn't care about their boyfriend's/husbands *even though some of them were in the room with them.*

They didn't care about being the pursuer, or looking like a whore, *which women usually care very much about,* because **every** other woman was practically jumping this guy's loins. 

For her, this is her chance to obtain the seed of a man in the top 1%, and every other woman in the room is fighting for it as well. Being labelled a whore is the least of her worries. 

This, gentleman, is an example of how fast things can change for you. Even if your LTR loves you more than she thought possible, all it takes is a more attractive man with better genes than you to waltz along, and given the opportunity, she will jump ship faster than you can say: ""but why?!""

This is why marriage isn't advised in this sub. Honour does not exist for women. Their biological imperative trumps all. Logic. Rules. Laws. But it is not their fault, it is just how they are. It is a hard pill to swallow, but you must understand that you cannot love and trust woman like men do in hollywood movies.

Remember: You must always be prepared for the scenario where she cheats on you with a better man. It may never happrn to you, but even if you've done everything right, things can change in an instant. It isn't anyone's fault. Hard next and move on.",887,4.0,0.38940000534057617,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
888,2qi8a4,"We need some ""corrective"" discussion up in here. This shit is getting ridiculous.

In yet another post lamenting the nature of (western) women, this was the main point that was upvoted:

>focus on building real true frienships with other guys, guys that probably are gonna be there when you need them 

How is this sexual strategy again? How is this relevant to getting laid and cultivating plates?

In short, why does ""Bro Code"" have to be the fallback plan in every post where a guy is having trouble with women? Why is withdrawing from women even considered? What happened to actually *learning* how to deal with them?

Examples of actual sexual strategy:

- Flakes: double and triple book my dates for redundancy. 

- Drunk girls: Don't target girls at bars who are plastered. Or, work out logistics so dates are near your place and within walking distance so you don't have to negotiate them into a cab.

- Western women: Target selection. Take control of where you live (I live in Asia (personal choice I made) that has certainly solved this problem). Or choose better what targets you talk to. Or move to a bigger city like LA or Vancouver. Or [make your frame solid that women's shit tests don't matter](https://archive.today/P3bLx).

- Lack of loyalty (cheating) in women vs men: This is the nature of women and can be understood and exploited. Women are not men and loyalty to *one* man has never benefited them. What they *are* 100% loyal to is high SMV (could be one man or many). Once you understand that, you can achieve high SMV so you don't have to deal with this.

Not sexual strategy:

- ""Ugh I got burned by a bitch again. So fucking done. Going into monk mode, fellas!""

- ""Always value your bros because they won't betray you!""

So...are you going to turn gay? Are you going to fuck your guy friends when you're horny? 

Yeah I didn't think so...so, why is that even offered as a solution? What happened to solutions that actually accomplish the original goal? (aka effective ways of getting laid and dealing with the *true* nature of women, the understanding of which has been largely lost in today's generation of men).

Again, this sub is about **Sexual Strategy**, which requires you are actually in the game. 

It's NOT a male support group where we recover from the big, bad, meanie women and act all horrified how they don't share male views of sex/relationships/commitment/honesty and the favorite ""bro code"" word of the day: Honor.

Newsflash: If you are dumb enough to put trust into a woman and then get surprised/butthurt when she doesn't reciprocate, then you don't know women. If put in 10/10 effort and are entitled enough to think women should/will put in 10/10 effort back, you don't know women.

Women respond according to what will garner them the man with highest resources, and the ""morality"" of that response is irrelevant. Women will rationalize/justify/hamster their behavior after the fact; In her mind, cheating on you or dumping your ass for a buffer guy was 100% justified and not wrong. Complain about it all you want, but she made the right choice FOR HER, for her survival, for her instincts. 

---

On the other hand, if you actually GET sex regularly, you will understand that lumps/drunk girls/random flakes/etc go with the territory. Yet, these difficulties now precipitate ""monk mode with my bros"" instead of actually solving the issue.

Seriously, you know how many drunk girls have thrown up in my bathroom/kitchen? How many times a girl has ghosted on me? How many times I've fucked a girl I thought was totally into only me and then her phone rings while she's sleeping and it shows up as ""❤❤❤ My Bobby ❤❤❤""? 

These ""speed bumps"" shouldn't be surprises, nor should they justify opting out of the game. It will not solve your issue.

Further, the implication that monk moders have a monopoly on male friendship, working out, or saving money is ridiculous. There is no connection. Getting laid gets me lots of male friends who give me props and want to party with me; it gives me the motivation to work out harder; it saves me $ because I spin plates who come directly to my home instead of buying them dinner/drinks.

TLDR: Get better at getting laid; Don't give up on it altogether. If the goal is to get laid and you fail at that, suddenly redefining the goal as not getting laid anymore is a total cop-out.",888,4.0,0.3709999918937683,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

Old plate / girlfriend wants to meet up, we meet and in the end is going nuclear on her own social circle.

Body

It has been a while since I swallowed the pill. My then girlsfriend let's call her S for this story endured the blast of my anger phase - while still in the honeymoon phase. This is ironic because S became a sexual freak during. I stopped her advances because I saw what she was doing. Bribing me with sex to gain my affection and it was disgusting. 

After I passed every shit test possible through my anger ""yea when you leave take out the garbage""; ""I have no interest in your family before I know you so I won't baby sit your teenage sister"" etc. I failed every comfort test: ""Hell, I never get married honey"" ""We go ice-skating when we have children because hell will be frozen over"" she broke up with me; how surprising.

This was saddening for me because she had a warm nature and stayed with her personal king of the betas for over 3 years together before we met and she branch swinged. While she was 19, 3 years with a full blown beta is remarkable. She is an HB7 for that matter. She went back to her former-former ex-boyfriend a fat dude who banged her well and so the radio silence started.

Fast forward 6 month

So her we go: she sent me a text asking for some legal aid. Knowing the RP, I immediatly figured she and fatty-fatso broke up; and a meaty lawyer-steak á la providér seasoned with abs smells so good.

We meet and I still have some anger in me. Not anger against women but anger against her, she changed me for a fat fuck who lives in a van and now wants to change back. 

Anyway, we talk. She tells me stuff about her dad being an asshole.  I do not listen. Like it was when were doing fun stuff (I was very poor in my younger years so I enjoy amusment parks and doing spontanious things I never had the money for in my teens). 

Then S asked me whether we want to meet up again. 

To which I replied what her legal question was because I got appointments (lie). 

After some mumbling about seeing me again she tells me she thinks about 'us'. 

I look her in the eye: ""you left and fucked your ex, I am not your plan B"" shocked about this she asked how did I know after denying everything for several minutes.

And so the machiavellian H-Bomb is about to be dropped:

 ""people, especially your friends talk, and you know what, people talk in a very detailed way"".

This is all a lie - a gamble if you will; I knew from Facebook that she was seeing a fat guy who had pics of a van in the background, dumb as S is she rambled back in our LTR about how much of an idiot she were when she dated that guy and showing me pictures of him.

I left.

Three hours later: an unknown number messaged me. Telling me all the shit they told me were in confidence blah blah blah. Mind you none of her bitch friends told me anything.

Whatever. Dudes will flirt. I'm standing there, lightly grilling him on his nerdy cashmere sweater, not really paying him mind. However, I notice my girl starts making heavy eye contact with him. At one point, he's holding out this peppermint candy to her, asking, ""You want it?"" My girl says: **""Feed it to me.""** While looking him dead in the eyes. There was no mistake: it was seductive af. I also noticed she was lightly running her fingertips up his stomach/torso. 

At this point, I grab her HARD by the forearm, yank her over to the side, and say, **""Do NOT fucking disrespect me like that. Ever.""** ""Do you want me to walk on you?"" etc. Suddenly, flirty-boy's posse  steps up and they're like, ""Don't touch her yo."" ""Why you being rough with her?"" etc. 

I tell them to mind their business and they back off. I'm fucking pissed, so, I storm off to the staircase (the balcony at this bar was upstairs). My friends are downstairs ordering drinks. 
I find them and prepare to leave as my girl's coming up behind me. I'm completely ignoring her and she's crying. We're starting to walk out and she's getting increasingly hysterical, shouting at me, saying, ""You have no idea how much I've given up for you! I cut off everyone!""

We continue walking down the street; her yelling and crying, me ignoring her, my friends awkwardly walking ahead of us. At one point I start splitting off in the other direction from her, to head to my friend's house, and she goes: ""FINE!"" 

*Not even 10 seconds later she comes running back up to me. Pleading.* **""I can't do this""** she sobs.

Eventually she gets really fucking hysterical (especially after I told her to fuck off) and at this point it's a legit *scene*. We're standing in the goddamn pouring rain and she's yelling and crying, her fucking makeup running everywhere. Repeating the same excuses over and over. She's saying sorry, and yet, also proclaiming she ""doesn't remember"" and ""doesn't know what she did."" 

Anyways. That night was the 1st time she told me she loves me. Neither of us had said it before over the 8 months we've been seeing each other (and we did have an LTR for a short period). 

Did I overreact here? From my retelling of the story it may sound like it, but all I did was swiftly reprimand her then ignore her. The other 80% of the time was her meltdown.

892,1cr401,"The hissing of past prime women is almost deafening.

I was out at a fancy function last night, the kind where all the men wear suits and all of the women wear dresses kind of event.

At first it was a meet and greet with the fellas, but it quickly dissolves from a civilized affair into its true form: past prime women on or off the carousel, desperately looking for a man, with no game and looks fading fast. Women approaching men left and right, and doing a horrible job of it.

**First woman** - was discussing something or other with a friend and I get tapped on the shoulder (approached from behind. Bad game). I turn around. I see two young 30 something women, makeup plastered on. ""Are you Jim?"" one says. ""No... Nope, not Jim, sorry"" I say. They're looking at me still. They continue ""Oh because we thought you were Jim"". They're trying to open me, but what kind of line is that? And why are women opening? Because no men are opening them. There are better options out there. Still, I am not opposed to a little game. They ask ""how is your night going? I'm Jen"". Jen is drunk. She's hot, for an older broad. She spills her drink on me almost immediately. ""OMG I'm SO SORRY"" She starts touching my chest. I'm unamused. ""You can make it up to me with a kiss I guess"". We kiss. She says she wants to go get another drink. I'm almost in disbelief, the last thing this woman needs is another drink. Her other friend leaves, and I go with this girl to the bar. I kino along the way, get a good feel for this girls body. Its pretty tight. She tried to DHV the whole time. Brings our a business card, she's a Human Resources Director for some businesses in town. I don't care. But this is her best game. We walk towards the dance floor. A big black guy comes over and they exchange kisses and lots of kino and sly glances and whispers. They're quite obviously fucking. He leaves, she looks at me ""what??"" I say ""not much"" she's pretty into kinoing me at this point, I'm looking for another set, or my friends or something. Enter another guy,  same deal, kiss kiss sly glances real close. He comes over to shake my hand, hard eye contact and really tries crushing my hand during the handshake. He clearly doesn't want me f-closing a chick in his harem. I look at this drunk mess trying to grind me, I think about how awful it would be to knock her up and how its not really worth it to pursue any further. I tell her to enjoy dancing but I'm gonna jet. I leave.

**Second group of women** - The night is advances and a bro and I are chatting. The night is coming closer to an end and we're discussing our sets that evening. I see a group of women scheming in my peripheral vision. They come over and open us. More girls opening, and not very well. They say hi and then stop. I'm sorta waiting for them to say something, but of course they have nothing. No game. Thats my job as a man. I'm a little bored at this point, but whatever, I'll entertain. I touch the hottest girl's elbow and lean in 'so how's your night going'. She starts playing with her hair and rattling on about her night. She's late 20's with a literature degree and is working an unpaid internship. She starts talking about inequality in society. Oh god. Her less attractive (read: not attractive) friend jumps in at a moment of silence and asks me if I wanna come to a big party. I say ""yeah I love big parties"" she goes ""Its not really big, just me and my cousin.. There will be like 4 people there. So how should we do this? Wanna arranage it through facebook or something?"". This girl is clearly wanting the D. So is the other one. They're independant-educated-women.jpg (read: past prime, poor, and fading looks). I don't want any of these women to know my full name or have access to my facebook so I do my traditional number close. ""Why don't you just put your number in my phone and I'll call you sometime..."" She's extatic, first girl who was actually kind of beautiful is sad that her friend got the number. She puts her number in my phone, I say thanks, I gotta go now though, find my friends and stuff. Bye!"" I leave.

I go to my bros. Tell them I'm leaving. I walk out, throw the business card in the trash and delete the number from my phone. An SUV is at a stop light by the crosswalk. The man in the passenger seat says ""Hey, the driver here thinks you're sexually attractive!"" - I'm not surprised by this, I deadlift pretty frequently and know how to dress myself. Its a woman. A woman driving some beta around. WTF.jpg.

So yeah, I go home and since I didn't find anything spectacular at the function, I go home and bang my young 22 year old woman. She's pretty hot and feminine. Good enough.

Women who have to open men are fishing from a small pond. They aren't youthful and attractive enough to have men falling all over eachother for them anymore but they still want as much male attention as they can get. They are failures as women. They will have to settle for some super beta, because seriously, they *are* competing with young women who are willing to trade some of their best years for that provision that all women naturally seek.

If you could only see the looks on these women's faces. It was that desperate ""I want you I want your attention I want to seduce you but I don't know how its never been this hard before"" kind of look. That look that men have before they learn that they need game to win in today's sexual market place.

These older women are absolutely pathetic.

""But zionController, women don't hit their sexual peak until they're 35!!""  Laugh my fucking ass off they do.

*Let's get back on track.*


This video series was about *18 year old girls on college breaks* that take the undergraduate educational experience as a birthright. The saddest reality is when you keep a keen eye on their intelligence, and they don't even remember the shit they learned last year. Most, if not all, their minds **rely** on fulfilling a *criteria* for a very **simplistic and short-term cognitive performance examination**, (which includes using a #2 pencil to precisely mark in a very specific section of a paper representation of runic intelligence) the ability to compose words on a keyboard with their fingers that her dad taught her to print, and reading off powerpoint slides that were invented by much better men than me. *Moving on.*


The point of this matter is that girls understand that their youth is the **most critical period** of their entire lifetime. And so capturing it on something as eternal as media is an inherent benefit *while their lives continue down a spiral of self-destructive critical thinking; denying all personal responsibility for their behaviors due to simplistic and short-sighted cognitive performance evaluations, followed by inappropriate recourse.* I am at an ivy league school and **I fucking hate it** when my fellow classmates are to be representatives of the future, and yet there are individuals who don't even pay attention to class by **sleeping or shopping for boots** on their laptops. A very good friend of mine, whom I initially pegged for very intelligent and able to speak two languages, admitted to me that her language abilities are only limited to **CONVERSATIONAL** matters. She can sing really well, though. But all she's good for to me is her vagina, and that's okay. She just isn't that special to want to have more, and in truth, most of these hot girls aren't. *Moving on.*


The result of this matter puts a spotlight on the certain category of females that us men choose to pay attention towards: The Sexually Attractive Female. And then it becomes like C++ and you have to define further classes of sexually attractive females and delete pointers (nexting), but I digress.


**Girls Gone Wild** exposed the very kind of sex appealing females we see at bars, clubs, and discos today (I haven't been to a disco, but I'm sure there are still cool people that did, and really know how to have a fucking great time). Majority of females see the appeal in having a *time-locked digitized representations of their physical beauty* as it **decays**. These are females who are....................

*40 years old in our world*

 (Yes, it really has been that long). 


But their short-sighted cognitive performance fails them with improper recourse and dysfunctional behavior. August Ames killed herself because she knew her sexuality was worth more than her very soul in this world after committing to virtual prostitution. That her mortal coil is but a shell for the electrolytic activity that is responsible for her physical manifestation in this reality. And she sees the happiness that many share instead of her. She sees the difference in how they look, and how she, herself looks, because us men notice this, and choose to share our resources to a variable degree because of sexual activity that only males and females can intimately share & abuse (properly or improperly). *In other words, ugly girls don't get to choose who we think is ugly or not, and they have no choice but to feel left out of their own sexual desires. So the many who are left out (usually gluttonous with sugar too), band together, and form soulful relationships because they don't choose to participate in a physical beauty contest they believed to have lost from the start. This happens while the pretty girl gets to ride in our cars and suck our cocks because she did win the contest, but then later feels as if it wasn't worth winning in the first place.*


So there you have it, a really long post that talked about many things, and yet somehow ties it to a historical relic from the spicy paid television series that was operated by Americans **AND** distributed nation-wide, in every home that owned a VHS player. With this evidence, we can see why society places such huge value in those bathroom mirror pictures that every pretty girl can take. Just always remember. *There. Are. A. Lot. Of. Pretty. Girls.* There will always be a lot. **Isn't that wonderful guys?** Isn't that just amazing? There are more than enough for each of us, and we can even share if everyone involved is okay with that. But right now I'm busy doing things where you all know me as that one dude who did that one thing really well one time, even though he was pretty terrible at it from the start. I wish fat girls would just get on board with this mentality so that there could be less of them for us to look at, but the ones I know and confront seem to respond with an ""idk"" response, followed by recollection of the personally devastating external events that led to a lot of ice cream and soda consumption. **All I see is silly compensation.** A guaranteed emotional reward with comfort in the event of unpredictable emotional discomfort, followed by a realization of a dependence towards this guaranteed emotional comfort, which concludes with self-perpetuated emotional discomfort. Sucks to silly, but it's not Ben's fault. Or Jerry's fault for that matter. No, it's the milk factories fault for cultivating and then immobilizing cows, jerking off their udders with automated systems, and then signing renewing contracts (guarantees) that are permissible in this economic real-o-sphere. This in reality governs national policy and the triple caramel chunk that exists in the frozen section of our local grocery sources. But wait...No, it's the policymaker's fault for being so stupid in the first place for allowing the fat health advisor to keep her day job so that she can keep depending on her triple caramel chunk to stop the tears. I think the feminist MO is rubbing off on me too much, so I'll stop that tangent here. 


And so on and so forth does the internal blame game continue to shift as this particular example of a simple-minded human existence continues to reward herself with self-destructive behavior, in whatever shape or form we see today. Pretty girls and ugly girls, both do it in various ways. And yet, they will always be one and the same in the end.


So do yourself a favor by realizing that most pretty girls are doomed from the start. And that you have no choice but to stop being nice to them because the world is already so cruel; nothing you do will stop it unless you want to risk **mania, psychosis, & neurosis**. If you act nice to girls that you want to fuck, then an anticipatory ROI is placed on the chessboard of your interactions, and she sees this now. This shouldn't be taken as a need to act more mean. It is just that the one who *truly appears to act completely indifferent* about the small behaviors that are intended to elicit a manipulated response is the one who wins. This has to last throughout the relationship, or she gets bored and moves on to destroy her life again by trying to be a puppet master with her short-sighted cognitive performance inherited by her ancestral manifestations that led to her own creation. **You must be the puppet master with your evolutionary advantage of detaching emotional responses with rational and reasonable thought**. Even better if she's cool with that because you have convinced her that you are the best that she will ever have in her short window for securing lifetime happiness. Failure to do so can be devastating for both of you, but unless one continues to fail, how else will he succeed? Okay enough writing, I'm going to lift now. I was really sad that I did 8 windshield wipers a week ago, and then could only do 3 on Monday. I'm such a pussy for resorting to deadlifts as an excuse for failing, but I think I can do 10 today if I don't do it at the end of my session. Cmon guys, brag about your lifting. Good for you if you actually did what you say.


**Conclusion. Preemptively approach a female with your phone's camera already set up for a video selfie. Every girl wants to demonstrate to the world about how kind and/or cool they are, which include the desire to be viewed as likable within a hidden audience that she is unaware of, nor really cares about. This creates an atmosphere of interest between the two of you because of her unknown evaluations of your desirable traits, which include social and financial capital. Ice broken, next legs open.**


TL;DR: Humans have two forms: Male & Female. Females are against time, more so than males. Pixelated mirror representations in digital space are an easy way for her to time-lock herself because she is aware of her race against time in this reality. This is so valuable to them that many are willing to make irresponsible life decisions that are not taken with serious consideration for securing long-term value. This includes your penis in her vagina.

That includes fucking as many **[temple prostitutes](https://aidanmaclear.wordpress.com/2018/12/19/we-are-not-rome/)** as possible, maybe making yourself a [biological weapon](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/new-california-law-reduces-penalty-knowingly-exposing-someone-hiv-n809416) and taking as many degenerates with you just like a Japanese Kamikaze pilot.

The other option was to create an atmosphere for [""Men Among the Ruins""](https://youtu.be/AvHM7H_hh80). These include places as such as this forum, the gym or any space the intent or outcome of the place is an negative outcome for an system any rational and traditional male would consider absurd.

895,1fnoio,"I am a recovering blue pill addict, and am slowly coming to terms with the reality of the dynamic between the sexes. I have a lot of questions, as I'm sure most men do immediately post swallow.

The gist of swallowing the red pill to me seems largely a matter of lowering one's expectations of the benefits of a romantic or sexual relationship with a female. [Iron Rule of Tomassi #6](http://therationalmale.com/2011/12/27/women-in-love/) and [Briffault's Law](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1anu3q/briffaults_law/) come to mind as reasonably succinct quintessences of the idea.

Accepting these rules as true (and boy do they explain a lot), doesn't this vastly decrease the perceived value of *every* woman period? It feels an awful lot like I have been saving up my whole life for a race-car, only to find out that *all* cars max their speed out at 15 MPH, and are twice as expensive as I was lead to believe (shitty metaphor, but I think it makes sense).

To put it bluntly:

Given that a woman is incapable of the sort of dependable, long term love most men seem to crave, and given that this inherently increases the maintenance cost of what ends up being the female version of love (if it is transient and conditional, it needs to be maintained constantly), is it still worth it to pursue women as mates for anything remotely serious? What makes it worth it?

Also, given that consistent sexual strategies have been proven to be successful amongst many different women, isn't the actual gratification received upon success substantially diminished? Whenever I have success with a girl via game techniques, the success feels superficial and dishonest. After all, I often find myself needing to suppress actions that I genuinely want to engage in (being significantly  less romantic/mushy at times, hiding interests in socially unacceptable hobbies), and needing to engage in actions I find boring at best, and reprobate at worst (pretending to enjoy obnoxious social events and pop culture, insulting/ostracizing perfectly nice 'beta' guys to establish Alpha).

897,73a3il,"I know I am going to be downvoted for this post because we have a lot of incels who celebrate the fact they don't get vagina(aka MGTOWs) around here.

But I do not know why people think MGTOW is part of TRP. It's not. I don't speak for the ECs around here but I have never seen any of them ever endorse MGTOW, but I have seen plenty of them say how retarded MGTOW is. 

Let me tell you a story. In college I played football. My sophomore year we had a shitty year by our standards. So naturally we had a bunch of guys who didn't play much or at all, jump ship and quit. After they quit when I would see them around all they talked about was how great of a decision it was to quit and how happy they were and how stupid football was. They claimed they quit because they had better things to do. They may or may not have been right but they always made sure to let everyone know how stupid football was. The next 3 seasons we had record years, finished ranked high in the polls and went to big bowl games. These guys who quit seemed to double down and shout even louder about how good of a decision it was to quit despite our success. Even though deep down you could tell they regretted it and were jealous of the success they could have been a part of had they not quit. They quit not because they wanted more free time or had better things to do, but because they didn't play and didn't want to put in the time/effort needed to put themselves in a position where they could get more playing time. It was easier for them, and looked better on them, to simply quit than put in the effort. 

That's exactly what MGTOW is. You don't want to put in the time/effort to get more sexual action, so instead you quit. It's the ""You can't fire me, I quit""! attitude of the sexual realm. MGTOW is simply your excuse, your smokescreen, your justification for not improving and doing what it takes. 

I know what you MGTOW are going to say. ""I had success, you see. But women suck! I want nothing to do with them!"". I call bullshit on you. Are you telling me if you had a stable supply of pussy and abundance when it came to sex, you'd walk away from it all and instead say fuck it? That's not how men are biologically programmed. Just admit you go MGTOW because you have no abundance, you have no game, you aren't successful sexually. It's a lot easier to walk away when you are failing rather than succeeding. That's why on my football team, when we started to get really good, no one quit anymore. Because no one wants to walk away from success. It's not how people are. 

MGTOW is the coward's way out. It reminds me when I was a pussy when I was 12 years old and went to my first junior high school dance. I was so afraid to ask a girl to dance with me I just sat out in the courtyard the whole time. I justified it by telling all my friends I was too tired from football practice earlier, when in reality I was just a pussy. It was easier for me to whip up some excuse as to why I didn't dance, rather than grow a set and do what it took to get a girl to dance with me. You think if I had danced with a dozen girls that night that I would have said fuck it and sat out in the courtyard and told all my friends I was too tired? Fuck no. Yet, that is what a lot of you MGTOW claim. ""I was so successful with women and had 25 plates and fucked 5 women a day, but fuck women, I decided to MGTOW!"" Yeah, no. 

Stop being a coward. It's really not that hard. I had a girl last night who was doing carryout at a restaurant I was picking up from. She was an HB6, nothing special but just cute/hot enough for a quick fling. She mentioned she liked my haircut. That compliment/IOI was all I needed to transition to a point where I ran game on her and 3 hours later when she got off her shift I was balls deep in her vagina in my bedroom. She was trashy and had tattoos and all other kinds of red flags that disqualified her from even plate material so I won't be seeing her again, but it's really not that hard guys. Some of you MGTOW need to realize that. You act like fucking a woman is like having to climb Mount Everest when in reality if you do things right its nothing more than walking up a staircase.

898,3uog9c,"TLDR: Shaming others and putting women in their place is what you SHOULD be doing. 

I see a lot of criticism recently on men who put women in their place. The typical criticism is that you are wasting your time and your breath and that it is not ""alpha"" to do so. And that it is no way to get laid. Bingo, thats the problem with that mentality right there, trying to get laid...

An Alpha male doesn't really try to get laid. I know, CRAZY huh. You're reading this and going oh bullshit so not true. Well it is I know from personal experience. Let them come to you. The fact that you compromise your beliefs and ideals just to get laid is repulsive. You are not RP. There is a quote my father told me since I was very young and have never forgotten, ""All it takes for evil to prevail in this world, is for good men to do nothing.""
And those with the mentality that it is a waste of time are guilty of just that. Natural selection is not going to weed these types of women out of the pickings. There is far too much media and men to support and reinforce their behavior. And it has gotten out of control, obviously. Thats why we are discussing it on this sub today. 

Shaming a slut or whore or feminist is exactly what you should be doing, Through intelligence. Not simply returning verbal blows, but actually de-assembling her ego and persona. Women might seem stupid but they are not. What you say to them if done correctly will ring in their psyche for the rest of their life. And that is where the change begins. When a man is being a pussy and letting his GF walk all over him, if all of his friends let him know he is being this way, chances are he will change and heed their advice. Similarly if men let women know the same when they are in the wrong. If enough take this approach, then we will start to see change.

You are not ""alpha"" because you are willing to dodge one or two shit tests and fuck some girl in a bar after a few cocktails. Sorry... If that is what you base your dominance and manlyhood on you are a pussy. Plain and simple. You are a boy. A boy with no control over his sexuality that simply needs to just get it in so bad! Ohhh god I can't wait to just fuck her and then I am so ""alpha"" now and so ""dominant"" because I fucked an inebriated bar slut even though she annoys the shit out of me. And in the morning I will solidify my ""alpha dominance"" by starting to play my video games and tell her to leave! Yeah... mmk. 

Being a man is having control over your sexuality and its needs. Channeling it. Because that testosteronal sex drive is some of the best fuel you can ever use to fund your life. Following your passions, obtaining success in the field of those passions, being content, fit, healthy, and strong. Helping the sick and being a leader amongst so many losers and failures. Being kind and courteous, until trampled on. Always being ready to destroy the enemy yet never wanting to have to do so. Complete control. That is dominance. That is Alpha. Handle your shit. 

Setting aside your beliefs and ideals just to get laid, your no better than the muck slut bar flys you hit on and succumb to. Re-think your shit. Stop masturbating to images on a computer screen and jazzing into a kleenex 3 times a day since you were 13, and go make something of your life. Build some fucking character. Move out... save money while moved out... If you are living at home past the age of 20 you're a fucking child. And don't tell me you're saving money, shut the fuck up. Seriously. 


Looks like this really hit a nerve on a number of you! I am glad. TRP is full of a lot of these types of porn addicted pussified guys who will do whatever it takes to get laid haha. Love it!",898,4.0,0.4025999903678894,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
899,bone1z,"# Intro:

Humor and cultural norms have evolved, along with shit tests themselves. While Agree and amplify has worked well in the past, it has already been replaced with Ironic Acknowledgment and it's time for you to catch up.

# What is Agree and Amplify, how did it work?

Simply put, A&A (Agree and amplify), is where you agree with someone, and amplify their argument to the point of absurdity.

Ex:

    Her: You're such a douchebag
    You: Yea, cuz you'll only find me in the pussy
    Her: Wow that's disgusting
    You: I like to hang out in the garbage afterwards 

&#x200B;

While humorous to the speaker, it only proves the listener right in 2019 Liberal Logic^(TM) and makes you seem autistic for not understanding that bloopies in 2019 are going to defeat A&A with:

# Litteral Interpretation:

A&A is dependent on the listener having a sense of humor, which fails in 2019 where everything is offensive, even sarcasm, and with remarks that are obviously humorous. A&A is defeated when your listener takes what you say at face-value, or breaks the fourth wall and acknowledges that you are trying to make a joke of the issue.

    Her: You're such a douche bag
    You: A&A
    Her: You're not funny and this isn't a joke

\*\*A&A doesn't work in the age of Liberal-Logic\*\*\*\*\*\***^(TM)** **Virtue-signaling as A&A is meant to be an Anti-Virtue Signal.** With A&A you are directly competing with liberals by saying, ""I don't care about the issue."" Where as they are directly competing with you by saying, ""You're subhuman for not caring"". Your plausible deniability is out the window along with any sort of mystery you could have had.

Here liberals are trying to squeeze you for sweet orange flavored validation juice, and you let them when you A&A. Instead give them Lime Juice with...

# Ironic Acknowledgement:

Here is some verbal Jui-Jitsu where you use your opponents momentum against them and defeat them with leverage. Key here is to ***hold*** ***Frame*** and deliver with as much sarcasm as possible. When people try to squeeze you for an answer you just give them the answer they want from a disingenuous point of view. Taking your statements at face-value is self defeating for the listener. Most people get tired right away after squeezing you and getting pure salt.

Dealing with accusations:

IA (Ironic Acknowledgment)

>Her: Are you even listening to me?  
>  
>You: Yea, *so interesting*

Vs: A&A

    Her: Are you even listening to me?
    You: Every single word

IA

>Her: I can't believe you're making a joke out of this  
>  
>You: This is so *super* *serious*

vs A&A

    Her: I can't believe you're making a joke out of this
    You: Not any more of a joke then your relationship with your dad

Her:

On the surface A&A and I&A (Ironic Acknowledgement) seem to function in similar ways, however A&A depends on your listener traveling with you as you attempt to blast their argument into outerspace. If they stay grounded you look like an idiot, or you just blow up the situation in a fashion that makes her genuinely angry vs playful angry.

&#x200B;

Dealing with Arrogance:

One of the strongest uses of IA is dealing with egotistical women in a way that deflates their ego, not justifies it like A&A. Using A&A on egotistic women simply feeds their sense of self righteousness while Ironic Acknowledgment gives them exactly what they were asking for, in a way that makes them feel stupid for asking for it.

&#x200B;

>Fatty: Don't you think i'm soooo hot?  
>  
>You: Yup, *definitely hot for sure, mhm.*

&#x200B;

>Stuck up Stacy: I'm like such a nice person, Everybody on my twitch tells me!  
>  
>You: Mhm, They're definitely watching for your *personality.*

&#x200B;

Here even if it's obvious that you're disagreeing with her, you're feeding her-own-kind-of-bullshit right back to her so she knows how full of shit she is. Even if she tries to spite you for your disingenuous actions, appearances are maintained and ultimately she has to accept her own retardation

>Her: Wow that's so mean of you  
>  
>You: Mean how?  
>  
>Her: You just called me x, y, z.  
>  
>You: Nope, I was *totally agreeing with how x, y, z you are* ***(Sarcasm is key)***

vs A&A which will remove the plausible deniability and escalate the situation (= no sex for u)

    Her: Does this dress makes me look fat
    You: Yea it's the dresses fault
    Her: You just called me fat!
    Her: Anger ensues, pussy clamps shut 

# Conclusion:

While A&A has some circumstances where it can still be applicable, Liberal virtue signaling along with the destruction of humor has left it vulnerable to Literal Interpretation - a death sentence for A&A. A&A is self defeating in the sense that it gives off the impression that you care about the shit-test, while leaving you vulnerable, and ultimately failing it (As the whole point is to demonstrate that you don't care). Irony and sarcasm maintain plausible deniability, while demonstrating to your listener that you don't give a fuck about her shit-test, and one of the quickest ways to make her pussy wet in the process.",899,0.0,0.2897999882698059,"girl, feel, really, find, still, shit, male, always, leave, relationship"

But for all of you who haven't: Black Jesus is normal Jew Jesus depicted as an African. Basically Blacks couldn't relate to [Jew Jesus](http://live-thedailyvoice.time.ly/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/JewishJesus.jpg) so they made themselves a Black Jesus. Makes sense I guess. Maybe us Whites should make ourselves a [White Martin Luther King](https://memeguy.com/photos/images/steve-martin-luther-king-jr-83079.png) to make him more relatable?

What about [the apostles](https://www.thepatriot.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/page-2-Jesus-having-the-last-supper-with-his-disciples.jpg)? Even Judas? Are all the Jews Black in Black Jesus world?

When do the Jews of Black Jesus world switch from being Black Jews to [normal jewy Jews](http://2xkcvt35vyxycuy7x23e0em1a5g.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ORIGINAL-CARTOON-YAIR-NETANYAHU-e1504981208160.png). I have a lot of questions about the whole arrangement, questions that have never been answered before in Black Church.

Why? Because it's impossible to ask philosophical questions when everybody be singing and dancing. Lordy Lordy! But isn't  examining the relationships of people in the Bible and learning valuable lessons the whole point of Christianity? So really the problem with the Blackification of Jesus is that it destroys the essence of Christianity just as the Caucasianification of Martin Luther King destroys the Civil Rights narrative.

Black Jesus provides a Simulacra of authentic African spirituality, while protecting Blacks from having to undergo the Real of African Spirituality: sacrificing animals, sex magic and dangerous trials. In today's busy world who has time for that? The whole endeavor is shielded from scrutiny because everyone is too busy singing and dancing.

Now Black Jesus isn't the only proverbial Black Jesus. Planet Fitness provides a fitness product without the obligation of serious physical exertion. Modern Universities provide a diploma without teaching anything of substance. American Women offer a symbolic marriage but refuse the material obligations of being a wife. No Fap allegedly helps chronic masterbators but is actually a place where masterbators masterbate about masterbation.

Black Jesus can also take the form of an individual process. It's inevitable that a [fedora gaytheist](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/616/546/ddb.png) interprets this article as an endorsement of religion. It's obviously not. But the fact that a bottom feeder prole is going to shit himself, miss the point and virtue signal for atheist points, means Black Jesus is alive and well. Perhaps someone will politically correct virtue signal [Das Rayciss](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/204/613/b74.gif). I look forward to it. Commenters proving my thesis elevates my posts into a postmodern collaborative performance.

Whenever the essential is abandoned for the symbolic that's a Black Jesus aka a Simulacrum aka a Blue Pill. This expansive  definition of the Blue Pill is difficult and unpleasant for our newcomers. That's okay. My job here is to [force difficult and unpleasant realizations onto boys who think they figured it out.](https://youtu.be/jojlVRUQoB0)

The Red Pill is more than antifeminism. The Red Pill is much bigger than that, it's a rejection of the Symbolic in favor of the Real. The Blue Pill is the inverse. Thus didling your phone in the gym instead of lifting is Blue Pill. Shooting validation texts at women instead of shooting semen is Blue Pill. SJWs are Blue Pill as their  existence in material reality is an imitation of a symbolic tumblr avatar. Likewise churning out masculinity guides while being unmasculine is Blue Pill. The most paradoxical aspect of the Red Pill is that the majority of people here never took the Red Pill and never will. They're here to act out masculinity symbolically so they don't have to live it in the Real.

As the world falls deeper and deeper into the [Postmodern Era](https://youtu.be/RJfurfb5_kw) more and more people will willfully spread their assholes for Symbolic Black Jesus. Reality is hard and pretending is easy. We’re descending into the aeon of the [eternal child. Narcissism](https://youtu.be/86OkGaKck3I), self esteem and feels are much more important than Reals.

The thing to remember is this. Sell feels. Get Realz. Give women emotion take pussy. Make your beta boss feel important take his money. The more people become children the more valuable being a rational male will be. Everyone is getting fucked in the ass by Symbolic Black Jesus. Don't be like everyone.

901,49da0f,"**Introduction**

The Red Pill is based on the idea that you develop a strong Frame which then becomes a platform to execute skilled Game.

*There is no following in Red Pill.*

**Body**

Let's go back in time to 100 years ago...

In 1918 the **Communists** came to power in Russia.

In 1919 the **Nazi** party came into existence in Germany.

At the time there were still many Monarchies in existence so the modern world hadn't really emerged yet and these were the new concepts at the time.

*The unifying characteristic of Communism and Fascism (Nazi) is that the model for the citizen is to be a follower.*

The Blue Pill is our present day emotional indoctrination process which through all the current technologies (tv, news, movies, internet, schools, etc) attempts to achieve **the same goal** which is to create a now *global* citizen who is a follower.

*A follower is a beta...  a slave.*

When a young man comes here to the Red Pill after having first realized that the Blue Pill is a fraud and a mythology his first inclination is anger.  We accept this as the *""Anger Phase""*.

There is danger in this moment.

At this critical point of awakening when the anger is highest the still mostly beta mind is vulnerable to the **Scapegoat Mechanism**. 

http://www.iep.utm.edu/girard/

Here it's possible to block the path of self improvement through the Red Pill and redirect the energy of all that anger toward a third object.

What does this do?

Well, it halts the Red Pill enlightenment process because the beta in the Anger Phase gets his emotions directed away from the real issue which is that the error was *being a follower in the first place*.

**Conclusion**

Following is central to all suppressed consciousness ideologies.

Red Pill makes a blanket statement that **we do not follow**.

This even applies to the Men's Rights Movements.

You guys getting outraged at the recent post about a guy fucking his best friend's wife are revealing **how little you know about women.** Women are not just capable but eager to engage in the most degraded shit. TRP is about realizing the TRUTH about women and the world, not about your morals.

You might think the following is just a humblebrag, but there are Red Pill lessons embedded throughout.

&nbsp;

How I pulled a long con seduction on my wife's best friend (now best enemy) and my best friend's girlfriend, and **put ZERO effort into it.**
-

This happened many years ago. Sweet Tits moved to town, needed a place to stay, and glommed on to my best friend and moved right in. What was the rush, she wondered later when she met me, but it was too late. So she spent the next year having to watch me go through a roster of every hot chick in the scene. All she could do was offer sexual innuendo, in which I was glad to partake.

When I heard that she reported significant ""sexual tension"" between us (really?) I knew it was just a matter of time, and I didn't particularly care how much time.

I moved away, but we still visited all the time (he was my best friend, and she became my wife's best friend) and over the years, the sexual tension remained. The greeting hugs and the goodbye hugs got longer and closer. She can't make a move, for fear of rejection by all three of us. Meanwhile, I find the situation hilarious.

TEN FUCKING YEARS LATER, I drop them off at the airport, and the goodbye hug includes side-boob, which she offered. And it's on.

TWO FUCKING YEARS LATER, she leans over to pick something up and shows me, not just cleavage, but the entirety of her sweet tits. *But,* she senses I didn't see (I did) because I might have been moving a magazine in front of me. So she leans over to *pick up the same fucking thing* to show me everything again.

The poor thing is in agony, and I'm not a cruel person; her boyfriend my best friend is out of the picture now. Milling about the house, we round a corner into each other. Eyes meet. **I just pulled her in for a kiss.** We had a laugh about the side-boob, from 2 years before; of course she remembered.

The fact that everybody else was right in the next room was apparently not a problem.

Some general advice for this kind of situation: **the first order of business, after the initial kiss, is a blow job.** Or two. Not intercourse first. I'll have to think about it and figure out why, but that's the way it is.

So, the next day, while everybody else is lounging outside, I ask/bet/challenge her: can you make me cum in two minutes? Yes, yes she can. 

Next order of business is the natural act, but I don't make any actual plans for it -- as I said, **I put ZERO effort in.** I tell her to meet me on campus after I'm done teaching. She arrives in a long flowing skirt. Carrying a blanket. In the middle of the day, we go lounge in a nature area, not secluded, about 30 meters from sidewalks full of eager young students. 

In full view of whoever wants to see, she undoes my pants and gets on top of me. She's not wearing panties. With the skirt draped over me, it might look innocent, but the way she was moving was pretty obvious.

That's how it began, and it ended shortly after, in her sister's bed. 

But not before my wife came downstairs in the middle of the night to see us on the sofa, with my arm around her. How do you get out of a situation like that? You play innocent, say it was nothing. Wife regularly brought that up to get mad about whatever, I eventually gaslighted her into thinking she imagined it. LOL

> Most people won't upvote because it's not relateable. This is the SMP most will never see. Between the humble brags (it was but who cares), there's an underlying theme... **what women are willing to do vs what they and society have you believe.** Always good to have posts that remind you of it.

Think about what this woman was willing to do: cheat with the husband of her best friend; blow job in the house with everybody right outside; first sex is in broad daylight in public; last sex is in her sister's bed.

-- James Fenimore Cooper, The Pathfinder, 1840 

The natural beta is insincere, untrustworthy, self-serving.  These are some of the survival techniques his reptilian brain came up with.  You can see it in the eyes, in timidity, in the limp handshake, the poor posture.  You can knock over a beta's disguises with the wind of a butterfly's wing.  You can blow his frame with a look.   No they aren't necessarily bad people.  But they are unpredictable and therefore about as safe as keeping a monkey as a pet.  They set their boundaries with a flamethrower and are dangerous when scorned.

This is no cause to wrong them.  But I have in spades and they handed me the keys.  

The first time was when I myself was still pretty blue pill but had some solid alpha tendencies.  I was probably about 26 and married 5 years.  I met a man, we'll call him Dave, while moonlighting at a convenience store.  Dave was a gigantic fat turd.  He simpered like a child, shook hands like a noodle, had nothing intelligent to say, grinned endlessly. Then he says ""My wife is picking me up later.""  

""Wife."" I thought.  ""I will have sex with her.""  Not as a plan, not as an expression of arrogance or hubris.  But as an immediate instinct.   Even without redpill theory my gut told me that this man couldn't possibly satisfy a woman.  And I knew I could.  She comes in, she's not too bad, a chubby 5 by my standards today.  A hole and a heartbeat by my standards then.  My wife gave it up all the time and with enthusiasm, but I had the 7 year itch that never went away.  And remember, I'm literally Hitler.  I love to cheat and  I love when women cheat with me.  It's white hot sex of the highest tingles.

So I befriend Dave.  I get invited to his home once or twice.  He's a ridiculous clown, though congenial, and his wife is pretty bright.  I seduced her a few weeks later.  While he's passed out in the bedroom I had her bent over a chair.  She became a fairly regular and to this day, a decade past his divorce Dave still doesn't know.  He was fired from the convenience store for frequent theft.  

Fast forward 14 years and I have several more of these events under my belt.  I encountered and befriended weak men who gave me all the clues of a horny and available wife and took full advantage with incredible ease.  They weren't just easy, they were low-hanging-fruit.  Each man turned out to be dishonest and self-serving.  Skipping the details because you get the picture.

Right now rent in the East Bay is ungodly so to save dough I rent a room.  Last week I interviewed for a nice room in a large home with a younger couple in their mid 30s and a few kids.  She's the talker.  She directs the interaction.  He's just.. There.  I tried to engage him in discussion but he lacked presence, misunderstanding the simplest questions and having a generally dead and vapid demeanor.  He smirked constantly.  He was short and pale and turned out to be a simple laborer and hardly proud to announce it.  His handshake was pathetic. 

 His wife is a slim Asian 6 who could not lay off of the hardly subtle IOIs while he sits there, grinning to himself about whatever might go on in the mind of a beta maggot, totally unaware.  I detested his weakness and the wild animal in me wanted to non-figuratively eat him.  When my friend later asked about the potential roommates I said without much thought ""He's a pussy and she needs to get fucked.""  Instincts again. 

I got and accepted for the room.  OK we know by now that this was a stupid idea.  There were great flowing red flags everywhere and like a bull I charged at them... Hey it's a good place and the ""amenities"" look fine. 

I had her on her back on my Ikea twin memory foam mattress on the 3rd night. I made no effort other than to offer to show her my fishbowl.  

Since I am in fact literally Hitler now you may be happy to hear I got my just punishment.  It's the 5th night and I was just asked to move out at the end of the month.  ""We're just not sure it's going to work out.""  I guess my leaving at 6 AM and coming home at 9pm and going to bed is really tough on them.  Or maybe it's something else making the happy couple uncomfortable.  

Bonus: the inherent dishonesty of the natural beta.

When he laid the news on me he chose to do it on the phone.  I wanted to needle him a little, toy with the situation.  Maybe even manipulate a better situation.  I quickly gave up on the latter idea and proceeded out of sheer amusement with discussion.  

""Why, what's wrong.""  

""We're just not comfortable with you.""  

""You brought me in under the pretense of long-term month to month.""  

*arrogantly*- ""That's not on paper."" 

""I think you should at least have the courage to give me a solid reason."" 

*smarmily* ""Maybe it's the way you're talking to me now.""

Pause.  What a fucking worm.  

""Ok then, well that's that. I'll get out ASAP.""  

""No you can have 2 months.""  

""No thanks, I'll take the pro-rate instead.""  Got him to sign an agreement to pro-rate just in case.  Sleazy cunt. 

You'd think I'd be ashamed but I find it hard to see weak men as people.  I'm still compassionate, I AM compassionate.  I feel for these sorry saps.  But this is the way of the world.  If a predator eats you it's because you suck at dodging and you deserve it.

Things have been great, she does stuff for me without asking, sex all the time, everything you can ask for in a girl despite me being a bit of a pussy. 

However there were two problems. She was sometimes very bitchy with me, and one out of three times we had sex she didn't seem very into it. Not that she was repulsed, but she would talk about other shit while I was inside of her. This pissed me off more than the bitchiness.

Fast forward to a few months after discovering the RP, and all that has changed. I lift and box 5x a week. I try and lead whenever I can. I hold frame whenever I can. I apologize less. I called her out on her bitchiness and after a 2 day fight where I held frame (with the mindset of, if we break up she wasn't right for me anyway) the bitchiness has stopped. 

I put myself first while still being fair to her, and especially after the fight it is clear that if I am unhappy with her or the relationship I will leave her, even if it hurts. 

The sex nowadays? Off the fucking charts. From all the other shit ive been doing shes already more into it, but the last time she tried to talk about other shit (not being focused on the moment) I put my hand over her mouth and plowed her. I've never heard her moan like that in my life. When I took my hand off she told me to ""do that again."" 

This was the sweetest, most innocent girl I have ever met two years back. Now? She's still that sweet innocent girl but she's my slut in the sack. I even told her that :).


Thank you RP.

TLDR:
Girl loved me even when I was a BP beta puss. Now as an up and coming RP alpha she loves me more than ever.

905,1dok0q,"Over a century ago, anti-suffragists knew what would happen if we gave women the same voting rights as men. [We are now reaping what was sown.](http://imgur.com/q2X4ybd,m4VDigT,dsZBAGn#1) I will list some of the early arguments made against women voting. Its scary how accurate our red pill fore fathers were, back when politica correctness was considered a bad joke.

- All government rests ultimately on force, to which women, owing to physical, moral and social reasons are not capable of contributing.

- Women are not capable of full citizenship for the simple reason that they are not available for purposes of national and imperial defence. The effect of introducing a large female element to the electorate would undoubtedly be to weaken the centre of power in the eyes of these dependant millions.

- Woman Suffrage is based on the idea of the equality of the sexes, and tends to establish those competitive relations which will destroy chivalrous consideration.*The physical nature of women unfits them for direct competition with men.*

- Women would be corrupted by politics and chivalry would die out

-  If women became involved in politics, they would stop marrying, having children, and the human race would die out

- Women were emotional creatures, and incapable of making a sound political decision

- “Women’s role is in local affairs.”

- Women are already represented by their husbands.

- It is dangerous to change a system that works.

- Women do not fight to defend their country

[Serious concern about the impact of women getting the vote was quite widespread throughout the duration of the campaign. This concern had complex roots bound up with Victorian views about women’s position in society. On the one hand women were considered too precious and innocent to become embroiled in public life, on the other they were thought too irrational and emotional to make an intelligent contribution. Whatever their abilities, their place was thought to be in the home.](http://imgur.com/dsZBAGn)

Women's suffrage is the worst thing to ever happen to Western civilization.

[Suffrage coincided with immediate increases in state government expenditures and revenue and more liberal voting patterns for federal representatives, and these effects continued growing over time as more women took advantage of the franchise. Contrary to many recent suggestions, the gender gap is not something that has arisen since the 1970s, and it helps explain why American government started growing when it did.](http://imgur.com/q2X4ybd,m4VDigT,dsZBAGn#0) Most women, when allowed to vote, vote democrat. Can't get enough of that state assistance. More welfare, more single motherhood. Women don't want to work as hard as men do, but they want more benefits, and they as a rule, will vote for the party willing to spend the most on them, just like they'll beta marry the man who will spend the most on them.

**Feminism is a socialist, anti-family, political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians. When the Senate took up the bill, one member asserted that ""disaster and ruin would overtake the nation.""** Suffrage would lead inevitably to ""government by females"" because ""men could never resist the blandishments of women."" Instead, he recommended that women ""attach themselves to some man who will represent them in public affairs.""

- Female voters, by and large, will be more liberal with the use of government or military force. This is because they are, even today, exempt from the worst of combat duties and potential military conscription

**It was not only because he thought that women were unfitted by their physical nature to exercise political power, but because he believed that the majority of them did not want it and would vote against it, that he asked the House to pause before they took the step suggested by the honorable member for Merthyr Tydfil. He believed that if women were enfranchised the end would be disastrous to all political parties. He therefore asked the House to pause before it took a step from which it could never retreat. **

Women's suffrage is a more dangerous leap in the dark than it was in the 1860s because of the vast growth of the Empire, the immense increase of England's imperial responsibilities, and therewith the increased complexity and risk of the problems which lie before our statesmen - constitutional, legal, financial, military, international problems - **problems of men, only to be solved by the labour and special knowledge of men, and where the men who bear the burden ought to be left unhampered by the political inexperience of women.**

908,1udwj2,"
Just when I think I have modern women all figured out; just when I’m comfortable looking any young woman in the eye and telling her where she’s been and where she’ll end up, a new truth becomes evident.

I’m no psychologist, but I am a keen observer of humanity. I also have the Scorpio’s infamous sixth sense, notice behavioral trends, and can boil them down to mathematical formulas in my mind on the spot. 

Though I still won’t pretend to know why women do what they do, I can predict their behavior with stunning accuracy. Nothing pisses off women more than when I pull out the little white envelope I mailed to myself weeks earlier, show them the official USPS stamp proving it was from weeks or months ago, have them open it, and it reads “You have been sleeping with either Jack or Tom. You started flirting with one of them right after I missed your birthday due to business travel”. The postmark on the envelope proves that I wrote it and mailed it before I even left for the trip.


I’ve only done that twice. I’d do it more often, but I’d have to get a second job to cover postage costs with the liars that have been running through my life in the past year. Sure it’s a bit theatrical, but then again, it guarantees a priceless look on her pretty little face.
While the overt stupidity of girl logic reveals itself to me like a two year old confessing to stealing a cookie, the more subtle things they say often pass me by. When a statement does catch my attention – usually revealed by her using her thumb to rub her index knuckle, a half- octave drop in her voice, or glazed eyes due to elevated blood pressure – I latch on like a dog to a chicken bone. I’m a very hard man to lie to. It sucks, actually. You have no idea how mentally exhausting it is to know you’re being lied to constantly. I don’t believe in psychic abilities or any of that jazz, but I truly am a human lie detector. In business, its my savior; in relationships, my curse.

Out of the blue the other night, during casual conversation, this girl I’m fucking says to me, “I was single for seven months after Bill...”

I stopped. I know this girl. There’s no way in hell she went seven months without a cock or three because she’s an attention whore who needs to feel powerful and relevant. She, like dozens of other women who have blown through my life over the past several years, was not purposely snowflaking. She meant what she said. She truly believes that she was single for seven months after she got booted for cheating on her last boyfriend (shit just keeps getting better for ole S2 doesn’t it?).

Believe it or not, I’m not always a dick. In fact, if you knew how much crap I let women get away with, you’d probably stop reading my blog. I’ve learned over the years that making a whore feel bad for being a whore is the last thing you should do if you want to get laid. What good is a whore if she’s not fucking you? Nada. So I try to keep my mouth shut, keep the pussy coming, and take my frustrations out in these writings.
So with that in mind I proceeded with caution, and out of sheer curiosity to see if I was right yet again, I gently guided her to tell me what she was up to during that time.

Take a wild guess.

Anyway, that’s when it dawned on me. Most of the time when women say (snowflake) they’ve been single for X months, what they mean is they were emotionally single. Bottom line is they had plenty of cock, but they weren’t receiving emotional commitment or support from any of it. When they get tired of fucking around, they go get another McBoyfriend to stick around for a few months if they’re lucky, and then the process repeats itself. It’s a win- win situation in that she gets to stuff her hole with the cock of the month, but pretend to be a woman of character later when she leaves out the details of what she was up to during her period of emotional singledom.

Brilliant, really.

This phenomenon may also explain how most women can lie with a straight face about how many men they’ve been with. They count the number of boyfriends they’ve had while discounting the number of men who for whom they were nothing more than a jizz receptacle. The concept of being emotionally single actually helps me understand a lot about my past girlfriends and flings who would say “I’ve only had 5 boyfriends my whole life”, yet they were bare ass up on the roof of my building getting fucked against a rather impressive downtown skyline on the first or second date.

I always knew they were full of shit, but I never had a term for it until now.

So there you have it. I know it’s no great revelation that women turn into willing cum dumpsters between boyfriends (thank god, otherwise I’d have to become a respectable man) but I think I’m actually starting to understand the mindset which leads them to self righteously portray themselves as “single” during that time. The fact that they lie about it doesn’t surprise me in the least; it’s the fact that they actually believe their own lies that boggles my mind.

Just for fun, here it is one more time:

I guess “I was single for seven months” sounds better than “In the time between Bill’s committed cock and your committed cock, I filled my time with uncommitted cock from guys who are obviously smarter than both of you”.

Emotionally single. Gotta love that rationalization hamster!",908,2.0,0.335999995470047,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck"
909,33m18f,"Betas and Alphas are entirely different creatures on a metaphysical level.

###The Beta Male clings to codes. 

*“Those who know, don’t say. Those who say, don’t know.” -Buddha*

When I use the word “code,” I mean it in the broadest possible sense. HTML code is just one of many types of code that Betas cling to. Beta Males are scared to face any reality without first consulting a comforting map of it. Betas cling to moral codes, behavioral codes, and language itself. (Language, written or spoken, is just a way to codify thought.)

The Beta Male ultimately misses the forest for the trees. They confuse the map for the territory. Betas are more concerned with codifications of reality than reality itself. A Beta male would rather win an argument than fuck a woman. 

We can observe this pattern everywhere. Quentin Tarantino has many hallmarks of an “Alpha Male” – he leads men to glory, he’s rich, he’s tall, he’s successful. Yet he’s ultimately a Beta male, and one of his key “Beta Tells” is the fact that [he needs to be “right.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrsJDy8VjZk) Betas like Quentin desperately cling to a rhetorical code of “right” and “wrong,” and they are utterly unable to manufacture that code for themselves. In Quentin’s mind, if he’s verbally right and someone else is verbally wrong, then he wins – no matter whether or not he’s actually made any profit, or fucked any women.

Another great illustration of a Beta’s need for codes comes in a [recent Buzzfeed video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2umJwt3U90) This is a video of a Beta Male and his(presumably) CC-riding girlfriend. The Beta Male is pulling a next-level Beta Move: Writing a song for his girlfriend after they’ve already broken up. (This video sad as fuck, bros. It’s like posthumous wooing… retroactive courtship. He’s so locked into the role of “Dancing Clown” that he continues to play it even after his relationship has ended.)

In the evolutionary race of reproduction, this Beta has been defeated. He has lost access to a womb. His genetic legacy is uncertain. So it’s a bit incredible that throughout the video’s introduction, *the Beta claims to “win!”*

That’s because he can’t create his own definition of success. He must latch onto a code created by others, and the easiest code to latch onto is the rubric of rhetorical “correctness” (debating skills.) The Beta in the Buzzfeed video is clinging to this code of “correctness” so desperately that he believes the code of rhetorical correctness is more important than the unspoken (and therefore, to the Beta, inscrutable) code of reproductive victory.

Betas cling to codes because they feel a deep fear of their ability to create codes themselves. They can’t create playing fields. Betas must step onto a pre-existing playing field in order to feel like they are winning a legitimate victory, rhetorical or otherwise.

The Beta's need for codes might be rooted in childhood behavioral patterns. When they were young, these Beta Males surely lacked the social skills to round up a gang of neighborhood kids for a pick-up game of soccer. They literally couldn’t create games. If they wanted to play a game, they had to join one created by another kid – frankly, a more “Alpha” kid.

**TL;DR SO FAR:**

In childhood, young Alphas brought the ball to the soccer match. They rounded up the kids and created the game.

Meanwhile, young Betas came to the soccer match infrequently, because they were busy studying. Beta children often concern themselves with codes – usually, that means studying school-provided codes of information. 

In adulthood, Grown Alphas create the soccer balls that people buy at the store. (Or they start companies that create other products.) Adult Alpha Males round up Beta Males and create codes of mission, meaning, and morality for these Betas to cling to.

Meanwhile, adult Betas eat cheetos and work at Oracle as Web Developers, writing programming code to win the respect of their peers and superiors… while Larry Ellison silently thumbs through his money, trying to decide which european model to fuck tonight. 


###The Alpha Male creates codes for Beta Males to cling to.

*“Control the options. Deal the cards that others must choose from.”
-Robert Greene*

Alpha males deal the cards. Alpha Males face reality head-on. Alpha Males create the codes that the Betas require in order to have meaning in their lives. 

If one person had created the entire english language, that person would be the Alpha-est Alpha Male to have ever walked the earth. That person would be single-handedly responsible for dealing all of the linguistic cards that every english-speaking person could possibly choose from. 

Obviously, no one can single-handedly create a vast language like English. But Alpha Males can and do create codes of a smaller scope. Alphas create moral codes, creative works, and tools that Betas use to feel secure in the universe.

Meanwhile, Alphas do not really feel the need to say anything at all. They think in powertalk. They have grown beyond the childish need for codes.

Alpha Males do not need moral codes, linguistic codes, or codes of conduct. They act on instinct and they shape their instincts through discipline. 

Alpha Males ultimately do not even need language.


###Understanding The Red Pill

Familiarize yourself with the concepts of [Powertalk and Straighttalk.](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/11/11/the-gervais-principle-ii-posturetalk-powertalk-babytalk-and-gametalk/)

Powertalk is what they’re doing in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuVJov3BXM0) from The Wolf of Wall Street – the words they saying do not match up at all with their internal thought processes. They’re speaking in a secret language of hidden meaning. They’re also Alpha as fuck, because Alphas are fluent powertalkers.

Straighttalk is different. Straighttalk is fact-based, logical communication. Everyone can speak in straighttalk – but Betas are often limited to straighttalk exclusively.

In nature, Alphas do not need language. As soon as they achieve alpha-ness, they utterly lose the need to explain SHIT. (As GayLubeOil touched on in his recent ""TRP in Context"" post, this was one of the problems with unplugging 1.0) The opinion that accompanies an Alpha-type mindset is that you are not required to explain anything to anyone, and you DEFINITELY don’t need to explain yourself. In a sense, Alphas lose the ability to explain themselves – because they never ever see the need to use it.

However, when dudes make the transition from Beta to Alpha after living in a world of straighttalk their entire lives, they retain the ability to explain themselves in straighttalking terms. That is The Red Pill.

TRP is the cold, bare, harsh truth about the world, laid out in terms so brutally honest that it causes revulsion in people who think and speak in powertalk. Frankly, both women and IRL Alpha Males are sometimes revolted by TRP, because the language of TRP is simply not a sexy language.

If you showed TRP to your Alpha Granddad from the south, he would be like “What the fuck is this horseshit, son? Who needs this shit?” Alpha Granddad has long since lost the need to straighttalk about topics like women. 

But we haven’t. So I will continue to codify the weird realities of Alphas and Betas and Bitches ’n shit. Even though this need to codify the world may be Beta, I’m chill with that. I like to explain shit in an articulate manner in order to help bros lose the need to compulsively explain shit themselves.

So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into dat ass.

I keep messing with this girl.

* I call her clumsy and evil and other names.

* She told me she scraped her knee and showed me the cut. I said ""good, suffer"" and poked at it.

* One time after we had sex she said ""Ok I have to go now."" I responded, ""Sexiest words a woman can say.""

* As I type this I'm eating the food she cooked and brought over earlier.

* Next time she comes over she will clean my place.

This relationship is just about sex. She's a booty call and full of dread that each time she comes over will be her last. All I do is use her for sex and give her a hard time. She always calls me mean, yet keeps coming back for more. **I never gave her a penny.**

She just told me she has cancer. She will have an operation soon. I hugged her and kissed her and told her I hope she will be alright. I'm not a complete asshole; I truly do hope she's ok. She's a very nice person. However, I told her that I will probably fuck other girls while she's unavailable for a couple months with surgery. Blue Pill spergs will undoubtedly think this is mean, but she couldn't be any happier to serve such a selfish and dominant man. They have it in reverse: **Blue Pill behavior is cruelty to women.**

Not only does The Red Pill work, but it truly makes women happy. Not that I give a fuck -- I'm all about mine.


**Edit**: She's just a casual fuck buddy I recently started fucking. If she was my wife/gf I'd be a lot more supportive but she's not.

The point of this post was to show that even women who literally have cancer still desire high status men with good genes. TRP does not change in such a circumstance.

Even though I don't see eye to eye with Roosh on a few things, I have to give him credit for figuring out slut tells.  

I have compiled my take on the topic, along with some added humorous explanations.  Take this with a grain of salt, not all generalizations are true...but you should assume they are to make it easier on yourself with less self doubt. 

Here they are.  

**Tattoos** (Tramp Stamp?  You have my seal of approval)

**Piercings** (If she can handle needles being stuck though her body, surely anal isn't out of the question)

**Fish Face** (Makes fishy face with lips?  You're golden, play with her tits.)

**Cusses** (Especially if she says “Fuck” or “Bitch” – This means a literal fuck is in order)

**Not Ticklish** (She's been felt up so much she doesn't laugh, but gets wet instead.  Ohhh yeahhh.)

**Drug Talk** (Talks about marijuana, meth or molly?  She can make you feel jolly.)

**Big Boobs** (Motor Boat that shit)

**Shows Skin** (Thats a nice short skirt miss, but where are your panties?)

**Body Hair** (More understanding of men)

**Association with other sluts** (They *do* move in herds!)

**Bisexual** (Rolls both ways, knows how to play.)

**Was in a sorority** (Loves those fratboy Chads.  Be like Chad.)  

**Went to a party school** (Arizona State?  University of Colorado?  She knows whats up.)

**Lost Virginity at young age** (She knows whats up)

**Likes Tequila or Party Drugs** (Tequila makes her clothes come off.)

**Friends with Djs, Promoters, etc** (She knows whats up)

**Is a wannabe model** (Wants to show skin and be “objectified” by the “patriarchy”?  Let her) 

**Talks about sex** (Must like sex.)

**Daddy Issues** (She needs a masculine force of energy.  Give her that with your cock.)

*My favorite due to the irony:* **She is a 'Feminist'** (Feminism is largely a sexual strategy to filter out the weak 
men who give in to her bullshit with the 'aware' men who are able to reject feminism and still be the alpha male they fantasize about in 50s Shades of Bullshit and other rape fantasies.)  

**Tans** (Vitamin D makes you horny.  Look it up.)

**Hair Dyed** (Pink Hair?  You're on, player.)

**Smokes** (Tokes?  Then she chokes...on cock)

**Guy friends** (She knows whats up.)

**Color Contacts** (Insecure about own color of her eyes?  She wants your cock, isn't that nice?)

**Slutty Role models like Miley Cyrus, Taylor Swift or the Kardashians** (Baby lets make a sex tape like that 
Kardashian bitch)

**Wears Hoop Earrings** (Big enough to stick your dick in) 

**Grew Up with multiple brothers** (She knows whats up)

**Went to a Catholic or all girls school** (She doesn't know whats up and wants to find out)

**Loud voice or loud laugh** (Mating call?)

**Is an athlete** (Athletic people have high sex drives.  Yeah, science, bitch!)

**Drinks Whiskey, manly drinks** (Black Velvet Whiskey and Coke?  My favorite) 

**Online Attention Whore** (Ok ok, you want attention, but hows a real life man compare to your online orbiters/fans?)

**Majored in Psychology** (She knows whats up)

**Doesn't object to unprotected sex early on** (She gives no fucks except the literal kind)

**Good at Sucking Dick** (She knows exactly how to to caress the balls and suck dick like a fucking porn star.  
This is a really good talent.)

**Claims to be good at dancing but doesn't do any formal dances like the Tango or Waltz** (She likes it dirty)

**Is a single mom** (Can't get enough alpha.)

**Sex Positive** (Can't get enough alpha.)

**Moved to New York at some point but isn't actually from there** (She's adventurous.)

**Has Fake tits or ass** (Insecure about natural body, equals easy access to said body for you.  Way to go, champ.)

**Is a fag hag/fruit fly** (Hangs around gays, she must like rolling around in the hay)

**Into cosplay** (Kinky.)

**On birth Control** (She's expecting sex to happen at any point in time.)

**Always late to things** (Such a bad girl.)

**Man Jaw or man mouth** (High T levels maybe?)

**Somewhat overweight** (Insecure about body?)

**Her mother is a slut** (Like Mother like Daughter)

914,29gx1n,"2 weeks ago I took out a girl who was a solid 9. She has this Kardashian sort of look. We met online, randomly. I asked her out, she said yes, I took her out for a drink we kissed end of the night, was nice and happy evening.

A week later, I took her out again. It was the day after her birthday, to which she spent it alone. She has hardly any friends, and went on a monologue about how she doesnt spend time with her family.

She then over drinks tells me how she had a friend who was an escort and tried to get her involved in that. She was also jokingly asking questions about girls I'd been with previously. Was very funny but strange, why did she care.

I go back to drop her home, she admits she has feelings for me, we kiss and fondle in my car and she goes on about how she is going to survive this weekend with no money. She asked me for some change to buy a sandwich tomorrow. The girl is in a Classy dress and has zero money to buy food.

The next day (I didnt sleep with her) she left her charger in my car, which I drove to her place to drop it back. A very different girl greeted me. No makeup, nothing. Gives me a little kiss outside her bedsit which apparently is paid for by her Grandma. Insists I cannot go up and says she has cash for weekend, even though I didnt even ask.

We kiss I say goodbye, to the next day on social media tweeting how shes after a ""prince charming"" and she will ""Meet him one day"" and how she has a ""chastity belt"" etc etc. 

She unfollowed me then re followed me despite me messaging her. It hit me. Ashamed of her home. Ashamed to be seen kissing infront of her house. Classy dress sense. No family ties at all. No friends. Its a prostitute. It has to be. Shame as shes actually a fun girl and hot as hell (with makeup on) but I'd advise if shes seedy guys, just walk the fuck away.

915,47vtw5,"**Introduction**

We often talk of what it means to be an Alpha and that usually involves things like your SMV and it's contributing behaviors called Frame and Game.

But there is a simple litmus test:

*""The Alpha never gets played.""*

**Body**

What does it mean to be beta?

Well, the Blue Pill is the globalist emotional indoctrination process (tv, school, etc) that is gradually suppressing the consciousness of people worldwide.  The ultimate plan is a world of easily programmed beta slaves or as they say ""providers"".  We need not discuss this as it's a given on Red Pill.

So the *first level* of getting **played** is being played by the Blue Pill process itself.  If you failed to sense the Blue Pill is a Game being played on you then you become emotionally connected to your brainwashing and end up a SJW or simply the passive *Nice Guy™* with no clue.

The next level upon which you can get played is when the Blue Pill convinces you to be a **White Knight**.  The White Knight believes he's an Alpha because he defends women and fights for their causes.  But again, he is being played only now the Game player isn't the impersonal Blue Pill emotional indoctrination process but instead an actual female or females.  He still has no clue.

Then there are the PUA players, the guys trying to imitate Game in order to just simulate the behaviors of better men.  This isn't really true Game either because it's coming from a weak Frame.  In true Game play one has a winning offense and a strong defensive Frame.  If your Frame is lacking like it does for PUA's then you inevitably **lose the Game** that you started.  The PUA ends up played and being beta in the end.  Another fail.

Finally there is the guy who has solid Frame and tries his best to play good Game and simply gets outplayed.  All you can do is maintain *Outcome Independence* and accept that sometimes you lose and must do better next time.  The near Alpha is always improving himself and learning from past mistakes.

**Conclusion**

The Alpha is the guy who does not get played.

When a guy who normally is Alpha **loses** it's a blow to his status and if you let that go on it will gradually force you downward.

*So your Alpha status demands that you continue to win the Games.*

But at the same time a single loss doesn't send you to the bottom it just knocks you down a notch.  It's like MMA fighters who go up and down in the rankings only the Alpha status is more abstract because it involves subtle Game awareness.

At this point my mom already told her mom (My grandma) that she alone would be coming since we made plans, to which my grandma said ""Oh, it's just going to be you? Nobody else is coming?"" My mom buckled and said she'll talk to me and my dad.

At this point I told my dad ""Well I don't know, we made plans"", I could tell he agreed but tried to shove in a half-hearted ""Just for a little bit, we can still play pool""

At this point my mom chimed in and said ""Your grandmother asked you to help, and you know she's old, you can shoot pool anytime"". I was about to cave but then I remembered standing up for myself, not getting pushed around, TRP. Told her ""Me and Dad made plans already, fuck off"", then we left.

917,1fnvb7,"Buckle in cause this is a long read. 

Previous studies on womens attraction to masculinity have had confounding results. Some found women were attracted to masculine men while others found the opposite. I'm sure you've seen the dailymail articles claiming feminine men win in the dating game...right next to the one that says women are attracted to biological markers of high testosterone.

So in an attempt to put that to rest study separated women into two groups based on femininity; High bem-M and low bem-M. The high bem-M group was masculine and the low bem-M was feminine and presumably more attractive since [a womans attractiveness increases linearly with femininity](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8251-hormone-levels-predict-attractiveness-of-women.html)

This study found that for both groups their attraction to a man for a long term relationships was correlated with his rating on the ""friend"" factor which was loaded with the following positive attributes: helpful, cooperative, trustworthy, good father, wealthy, and intelligent. 

The preference did not change for high bem-M women when it came to short term relationships but there was no correlation between the friend factor and attraction for short term relationships for low bem-M women. In fact the only factor that predicted low bem-M womens attraction to a man for a short term relationship was their score on the ""enemy"" factor which is, in order of importance, ""**threatening, volatile, controlling, manipulative, coercive, selfish, dominant, impulsive**"". Remember the low bem-M women are the attractive feminine ones. 

There was also no drop off point where increasing masculinization was less attractive like there was for long term relationships. Literally the higher the guy scored on those traits the more sexually attractive he was for a short term relationship.

Combine this with the study that says low bem-M women are [more likely to cheat on their long term partner during their fertile period](http://www.ts-si.org/files/KristinaDuranteoestradiolandmating.pdf) and the implications are, to say the least, worrying.

[Here's](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513801000666) a link to the study.

Today I was taking a ride on the subway to go meet my friend and business partner for a drink, and I was carrying a bottle of whiskey(not something very expansive, but not something cheap either).

After I reached my stations, I had to go through a tunnel to get to the restaurant. During my entire walk through the tunnel there was a group of 4 men(ages 18-20) from an ethnic minority who were acting all gangsta and “thug life”, screaming, smelling, pushing each other, walking on the wrong side of the tunnel to bump into people walking in opposite direction, and disturbing pretty much everyone around them( btw, at that hour the subway is full, as was the tunnel), and nobody was saying anything about that( me included, as I was trying to ignore them).

At the end of the tunnel, there is an escalator, and this dudes where right in front of me, pushing each other and acting like monkeys, until two of them fell, right at the end of the escalator. I was about to trip on them… and in that moment I had enough. After I avoided tripping, I was so angry on the situation that I hit one of the dudes on the floor with my foot and started swearing and screaming at them. 

All the people around me were stunned. The other 3 dudes from the “gang” included.
And after that I was amazed by what happened. The guy on the floor who was so gangsta for the last minutes started crying and apologizing while the other dude who was down quickly run away. Meanwhile the oldest dude from the group(about 20 years old) was coming towards me all angry and shit. I just looked at him, opened my arms, with the bottle in one hand, and shout “Try me motherfucker, let’s see what happens”. He stopped coming towards me. What do you think he did after that? He started shouting that I was aggressing them, that I was a racist and a Nazi( well, I called them parasites,  because they are). Suddenly, the gangsta guys turned themselves in the victims. 

The security came immediately( the guard was from the same minority) and aligned with them as they said that I attacked them, and he(the guard) said that he would call the police. What did I do? I said: “Do it fucker, you will lose your shitty job after that.”. All that while I was having my killer face on. I wasn’t talking shit. I knew I had the power to make him lose his job if I wanted. I was pissed off. I was confident. I was ready to fight them all because I had enough with their bullshit. The guard and the 4 gangsta dude where all in shook. Especially as I was so pissed off that I even took the Nazi role that they gave me and started talking about killing them and their families because they were parasites.  I even invoked a historical figure from my country that murdered some of them while he was in charge(not Hitler, I’m not german).
And after that, something I didn’t expected happened. The people around us, who just stayed silent and stunned till then, started speaking. And guess what? They took my side. All of them. The first to speak was a lady(around 40 years old), then an old man, and after that everybody started screaming at them. And in that moment the security guard took away the 4 gangsta boys. 

After that I went to the restaurant and think about what happened.

I just applied the Sun Tzu’s Art of War without even realizing it. If you read something and meditated about it, you will apply it without even realizing it. Let me give some examples:

1: “Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.”
I’m 19 years old and I have an athletic physique even though I’m not all muscle and I can’t say that I’m a good fighter since I’ve never done MMA or something like that. I’m pretty sure there is a 75% that the 4 gangsta dudes could have beaten me up. But I didn’t back down, I hold my frame and I was the first to strike. The dudes got intimidated. They imagined that if I’m so confident probably I’m some Conor McGregor or something. Even though I was outnumbered and “outgunned” I acted strong and they backed down and turned themselves from the though gangsta guys to the poor minority victims.

2: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”
This is the most important thing in life. You must win you wars without a fight. As I did. If I fought I would have probably been defeated and badly injured. Instead I won without a fight.

3: “If the mind is willing, the flesh could go on and on without many things.” 
If your mind is strong you can surpass your physical limitations. If I thought about my physical power I would have remained a beta who runs away from danger.

4: “The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.”
Do I need to say more?

I could go on and on, but I recommend you to read Sun Tzu’s book.

Now, as I said in title, this is a clear case where frame helped me emerge victorious from a confrontation even without a fight. I acted as an alpha. I knew I’m superior to them and they, in their subconscious knew it. I knew I was going to a good restaurant while they where going to their shitty homes. I was superior to them from every point, even though they where stronger physically than me, psychically I have won the battle. I simply couldn’t stand being humiliated by monkeys who are basically just parasites to our society. Why should someone like me(someone who has his own software company and is kind of successful for his age) accept such a disgraceful display in front of his eyes? Why should the civilized man subdue to the barbarians? Just ask yourself this questions.

And now, in the end, what I learned about our society from this?
Simply: the vocal minorities(not necessarily ethnic minorities) have the power just because they are the loudest in the room, while the majority stay silent out of fear( either fear of getting hurt or fear of being called a racist/homophobe/misogynist), but at the moment a man from the majority took action against the minority, at the moment someone had the guts to do what everyone else would have wished to do… at that very moment, the majority’s power was unlashed. They didn’t care about things like being called a “nazi” or shit like that. They expressed their anger. They where happy that they were finally able to say what they where thinking. They transformed from a scared silent flock of sheep to an angry mob in under 2 minutes. That's the power of example. Our society just needs more examples of strong men to heal itself from the shit that it have become.

Now, I think you all will be able to draw your own conclusions from this. 

Being alpha is not about just banging a new bitch every night. Being alpha is about taking a stand and be a leader for your pack. Be like the lion who is protecting his property from hyenas . Be like the wolf who is leading his pack through winter. Take a stand. Take risks. Don’t avoid the danger.

Do not marry an older Cock Carousel™ slut with the Thousand Cock Stare™ and if you are older and with $$$ you should avoid marriage altogether.

But the reverse scenario where the man is Poor and the woman is young, has a low N count and is at her peak SMV is another story.

&nbsp;

**Body**

For a young girl in her peak SMV to be willing to fuck a young guy who is Poor it means that there is a level of Tingles that she experiences by your personality.  On some level she senses your **natural** Alphaness and wants to be near it.

&nbsp;

*You hold the Power position already.*

&nbsp;

Assuming she is a SMV 7, 8 or 9 your choice to marry this girl is not going to be improved upon significantly by another option.

You have **nothing to lose**.

*So how does this play out in real life?*

Well, you marry while Poor and she is at her peak SMV.  You have some kids and start to increase your career.  The money increases to be able to pay for the kids and yourself, but there is **no surplus**.  You stay frugal.

This is difficult for some to imagine...

You must learn to **live cheaply**.

* *Example One:*

I can remember in my own childhood my mother married my father because he was the relatively Poor ""immigrant"" (actually second generation German, but my mother goes back to the Founding Fathers...  so it's relative) and while I grew up we were very frugal about everything.  Eventually we moved to the Upper Middle Class town and we barely could afford to get in. But the whole thing had the feel of an exciting adventure because my father had this Amused Mastery way of defining reality as a wonderful thing.  We physically were Poor in the relative sense, but felt great inside.

* *Example Two:*

My nephew married a ""Good Girl"" at 24 and quickly had kids.  They started off Poor and my nephew quickly increased his career by getting into tech support and now manages a dozen people as part of tech support for Apple.  They aren't rich, but they seem to be doing fine.  They don't buy stupid crap or take stupid vacations.  Generally their lives are very good and they have high levels of life satisfaction.

&nbsp;

***The Counter Examples***

My younger brother married a wealthy girl (which should be great based in some people's opinions) but then did the **one** thing he wasn't allowed to do...  he got a vasectomy.  He ""didn't understand"" his role was that of ""sperm donor"" and he had actually done this vasectomy in secret.  The wife had millions that she was going to inherit eventually so she expected to have a dozen kids and when she wasn't getting pregnant she knew something was wrong.  In her mind his lack of sperm was interpreted as being Poor and a decline from the initial condition. Result: Divorce.

&nbsp;

My older brother married young and Poor.  He had kids.  Things were fine for 11 years then he loses his job.  Result: Divorce.

&nbsp;

**Conclusion**

This is the brutal truth:

&nbsp;

*If you marry while Poor to a higher SMV ""Good Girl"" you can pull off a successful long term marriage as long as you make ""just enough"" to get by, but not ""too much"" to allow the woman to be spoiled.*

&nbsp;

Women need to feel things are either remaining frugal or slightly increasing.

Once you understand this you see why **being rich in the beginning** is a bad idea.

If you have $$$ you must never marry.

&nbsp;

*It is far better to start Poor and climb than to be Rich and fall.*

**Body:**  Tonight I went dancing. While I was at the club, I sat down at a bench to take a bit of a break. A woman sits next to me and I open her. Within a few minutes, I am talking to her, have my arm around her etc.

The song ends and a new one begins, I tell her we're dancing. We dance, flirt, and get physical on the dance floor. I telll her ""let;s have a drink"" and she follows me to the bar. 

All of a sudden I look back and I don't see her. I look around - nothing. I finally look up and see her on stage with the live music - the lead had given her some fucking instrument to play.

I got myself a water and just laughed at the hypergamy at play. I was annoyed for a second and then realized; women only date/fuck up. It took the dude in the room with the most social proof to get the chick. It was amusing to see TRP in the real world.

Likewise there is a place for yoga pants and that place is the gym and wherever you go to eat after the gym. The stipulation being that you are not allowed to wear heavy makeup and yoga pants at the same time. 'But like that's racist against women!"", Sandra objects while flipping her bleached hair.

Naturally skinny dudes have it rough.

The truest, best, and most common advice you'll hear is ""increase your calories to 3000 per day"".

Hard gainer here. 6'2"" tall, 180 lbs.

A month ago I was 170 lbs.

How 10 pounds in such a short period?

Simple. Been doing a ""pasta + 1"" bulk. I eat a ton of pasta each day plus one other meal.

It's easy to hit your caloric goals and also delicious.

Here is my recipe for ""poor man's baked ziti"".

**Daily shopping list:**

* $1.00 - 16 ounces of pasta (ziti or rotini)
* $1.50 - 24 ounces can of marinara
* $2.00 - 24 ounces tub of cottage cheese

**$5.00 after tax, per day**

Recipe:

Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add a splash of cooking oil.

After the water is at a rapid boil, add half the box of pasta.

Bring the water to a boil once more (should take less than 60 seconds) and then turn the heat off. Let the pasta sit in the water for another 10 minutes. The residual heat in the water will cook it further.

Drain the pasta and set it aside.

Grease the inside of a skillet with cooking oil.

Pour the pasta into the skillet.

Scoop out half the tub of cottage cheese on top of the pasta in a thin-ish layer.

Ladle half the can of marinara evenly over the top of the pasta/cheese.

Cover the skillet with a lid or tinfoil and let it cook for 20 minutes on low-medium heat (3/10).

Ok, it's cooked. Put on a movie and stuff your face. Relax and take your time eating.

Do this twice a day.

You need to eat the whole box, the whole can, and the whole tub, each day.

**Caloric breakdown:**

* 1600 kcal total - 16 ounces of pasta (ziti or rotini)
* 660 kcal total - 24 ounces of cottage cheese
* 300 kcal total - 24 ounces of marinara

**2560 kcal overall**

I make up the other 400ish calories with a peanut butter jelly sandwich or a cream cheese bagel each night after the gym.

3000 calories is easy to do on a budget.

**Protip:**

Pasta every day can get sort of monotonous. Flavor it differently on different days and you'll love it.

My favorite marinara brand is ""Hunt's"". It comes pre-seasoned and there are literally 10 different flavors. Buy one can of each flavor and change up every day.

Spices are your friend. A $1.00 shaker of Italian seasoning makes all the difference. One shaker of seasoning will last you a month. Garlic powder and black pepper are tasty too. You get the idea.

Parmesan cheese runs about $3.00 per bottle and one bottle can last a week.

My favorite way to make the pasta is to prepare it as above, but in a baking dish with Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. A 12 minute bake at 350 degrees on the top oven rack crisps up the pasta tips around the outside and browns the Parmesan slightly. It tastes amazing like something from a bistro.

If you're prepping dinner for guests, busting out a baked ziti with browned Parmesan and spices on top will make you look like an Italian chef and the whole house will smell like heaven. Bake some garlic bread alongside it in the oven and you'll look like Emeril Lagasse.

**BAM!**

On an unrelated note, I've been spending more and more time with my lover, so yesterday my wife *confronted* me as asked me if I was having an affair. I didn't admit or deny to it right away but I started a conversation about the state of our relationship, this time was a different type of conversation, I was focused on:

* maintaining *Frame*

* being *Alpha*

* *DGAF*

* *outcome independent*

It was interesting how I remained calm and emotionless throughout and I was able to:

* call my wife's bullshit, when it was bullshit

* control her emotional outbursts, just by calling them

* call out her *rationalization hamster*, just by calling it

* keep the conversation on topic by not allowing her to deviate from where the conversation was going if it was no longer convenient to her

At one point I told her that I am having an affair, that I *care* about my lover but don't *love* her; and that I *love* her (my wife).  I told her that I don't intend to end my affair and that she (my wife) is free to leave any time she wants.

I didn't give in into any details about my affair, she doesn't know who my lover is, how long it has been, my line was always *It will only make you feel bad*.

Then last night wife and I fucked like we've never fucked before, and this morning too she wanted to do it again, a rare occurrence in our sex life, then she texted me that she loves me and she's looking forward to fuck again tonight.

For those of you wondering: 

* no, wife won't be having an affair. 

* Will she leave me? Maybe. I don't care, I've told her that I want a divorce but she won't agree (long story). 

* If she gives me the ultimatum *""me or her""* I will just remind her that I've asked her for a divorce long time and multiple times, she just need to agree to it and we both walk away.  

* In case of divorce my lover would just be *a plate*, as of now I think of my wife and my lover as 2 plates.

Through the years I have had affairs, now I know better, it was a way for me to cope with the way I let my marriage slip, a typical pre-marriage Alpha becoming Beta.  My asking my wife to consent to the divorce is a favor to her, to protect her financially and to ease her into a post marriage life; she won't do it because she loves me and adores me, and she's hoping to work things out, but after 15+ years or trying to work things out I have given up, I have swallowed the Red Pill and I have realized that having affairs is not a way to cope with a bad marriage, even one where I ~~love~~ *loved* my wife.",923,4.0,0.38109999895095825,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
924,24tx7m,"I keep seeing this topic brought up and I decided to look into it.

There's no scientific evidence to support the idea nofap does anything for people except give them a placebo effect.  Whatever positive results people report are likely all in their mind.  

I can start a movement called 'drop hammer on toe every morning', and if I convince people it can help them improve their lives and they follow my advice, some or even many people will report success and keep dropping hammers on their toe.  People who get the placebo effect will join /r/nofap and convince others, and people who got nothing out of it won't, meaning the subreddit is a classic case of selection bias.

Since there is no evidence supporting nofap, I think it's highly questionable to suggest to men struggling to get laid that they should deny themselves sexual release.  Their lives are already fucked up, and they can better themselves in so many other ways, like lifting.

People can get psychologically obsessed with anything, gaming, porn, drugs/alcohol, TV, religion, etc.  If you have an unhealthy obsession with something, you might want to consider cutting back, but please don't delude yourself about the efficacy of denying yourself simple pleasures.

If you tried nofap and got something out of it, great, but realize it's likely not the nofapping itself that did anything for you.  You did it yourself, mind over matter, cogito ergo sum.  And that's ultimately more empowering than relying on the lie of nofap.

TL;DR:  There's nothing to support the theory that porn rewires the human brain and affects the dopamine-reward center.  There's nothing to support the idea it can alleviate approach anxiety.  Testosterone levels are only increased on the 7th day of nofap and thereafter return to baseline.  No empirical data supports porn-ED theory.  Porn does not cause mental disorders, people with mental disorders are drawn to porn and tend to get obsessed as a way of checking out of reality and self-medicating so they don't have to deal with the underlying issues they have (like depression, anxiety, laziness, obesity, low self-esteem, etc).

Just to remind everyone of what they're up against, the Treasury just announced they're removing Andrew Jackson from the $20 bill and replacing him with Harriet Tubman, a black female civil rights activist. This has been a pet project for SJWs for awhile - after all, Jackson, who lived from 1767 - 1845, was a bad man by modern standards. He was a roughneck who moved the Cherokees off their land, causing the Trail of Tears. In other ways, he was also a ferocious defender of liberty and a great enough president -called the People's President in his day - that they put him on the currency. Like many historical figures, a mixed bag to be sure. Learn about him here http://thehermitage.com/learn/andrew-jackson/ and ask yourself - Harriet Tubman was a brave woman, but are her accomplishments anywhere close to Jackson's?

While what he did to the Cherokees was terrible, remember that it's not about morality, it's about power.

**Body:** I have to get this off my chest, since I am freshly unplugged and have used RP theories in my sexual strategy to my advantage. I cherish and value the input and advice of the community on this matter, however, many posts about the immigration crisis lead to wrong conclusions. Just a disclaimer before beginning: I am a German citizen and therefore not an English native speaker. I excuse for any misplaced figures of speech and/or wrong orthography/grammar.

Over the last few months, a number of posts concerning the European Immigration Crisis have acquired a high number of upvotes.
 
The major points are about censorship and suppressing ""hateful comments"" in the media and reddit. No discussion about that. Even worse is the climate this creates, people **afraid of voicing their opinion** and thus self-censoring themselves. However, let's take a look at some opinions voiced in the comments about immigration.

> It's interesting to note it was Feminist organizations and primarily-female protesters leading the push for the female chancellor Angela Merkel to let in what is essentially an aggressive barbarian horde. 
*ThereAndBlackAgain*

> The really ironic thing is if those Muslim ""refugee"" types that they rush to defend end up acquiring too much power, they will have no problem putting the femicunts in their place. You think you are oh so oppressed now, how about some Sharia Law and a REAL patriarchy? 
*Polaris382*


> In the past, they let immigrants trickle in, so even the more hostile ones would have time to settle down and feel like a significant cultural minority. This created a lot of pressures for them to integrate into German culture.
Now, fast forward to today, and that's all changed. The mass influx of these immigrants allowed them to create ingroups where they don't need to deviate nor change from their current cultural hang ups. They aren't integrating, nor are they inviting. Today, I actually feel worried at times walking down the street. I have friends tell me about being robbed, I've seen people get punched, and stores actually broken into and robbed. It's crazy -- I'm sure it occasionally has happened in the past, but now it's actually at a frequency where I notice it. It's crazy.
*trpsenator*

> Even if it did get out to mass media and it was focused on, people still wouldn't believe it. The evidence is everywhere that the migration crisis will destroy our culture, but to say so is still 'racist' and people don't want to speak up.
*deleted*


The essence of the arguments is:

* Feminists want migrants since they're naturally alpha a.k.a. *they want to be dominated by real men unlike the pussified beta western males*.

* Europe is being invaded by hordes of Muslims.

* Public security is declining because of them.

* Public opinion is afraid of talking about this issue because they could be labeled ""racist"".

Being German, having worked in a refugee camp, having read as much as every opinion piece on this topic in local/national/european media, this is an issue which I have to deal with *on a daily basis*. There are two refugee camps directly in the vicinity of my college, even one *directly on the campus*. **Keep in mind that I cherish free speech as much as the majority of RP subscribers do**.


_______
I'll start from the very beginning, even with the possibility of going off-topic for a moment: the signing of the declaration of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/). Article 14 states: Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.

Built upon that, the [Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees](http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html). 

Pillars of human rights and a bright and shining example of empathy between human beings, wouldn't it seem?

Now, let's go on, away from the post-WWII-era to the topic at hand, the migration crisis. 

2015 was the year with the most forcibly displaced people since founding the UNHCR, totalling at 59.5 million, expected to be more till the end of the year. Main causes were the were the Syrian civil war, the Islamic State, the ongoing war in Afghanistan, etc. They are well-known. Main hosting countries (with over a million each) are Turkey, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Iran.
[Look up the data here.](http://www.unhcr.org/56701b969.html)

The conditions of living in the refugee camps in those hosting countries are bad. While Turkey, main piece of interest, still has the best accomodation, [take a look at this report.](http://leftfootforward.org/2015/09/what-life-is-like-in-a-turkish-refugee-camp/) They live in tents, have basic access to healthcare and education, but are not allowed to work or set up residence elsewhere in Turkey, plus with the influx of more and more Iraqi and Afghan refugees, the living conditions are deteriorating. Why not flee on, towards Europe? I can understand why. Many people will disagree, but **I think that Europe and the US have a humanitarian duty towards war refugees**. And come to think about it, we aren't even taking that many. Estimations are between 1.3-1.5 million refugees for the whole of Europe. **Now talking about the total population of the European Union, that totals to 0,29%.
Germany is taking roughly a million of them, which brings it to 1,2% of the population.** Plans to redistribute the load between member states are on the way.

Seeing these quotas, I don't think we can speak of an invasion. Just putting things in perspective. *Calling this crisis a barbaric invasion essentially contradicts the basic human rights we have fought long and hard for*.

The outer-european refugees mainly come from [Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Map_of_the_European_Migrant_Crisis_2015.png). 

[The perpetrators of the Cologne NYE attacks were mainly of North African Origin.](http://www1.wdr.de/themen/aktuell/vorfaelle-hauptbahnhof-koeln-fakten-100.html)

**To make it short, the German public is speaking very openly and controversially about the role women play in the Muslim culture and what happens to migrants not respecting the laws of the country.**

To be able to talk about feminism and it wanting the ""alpha refugees"", I really want to see your advanced degree in public psychology, sociology and if not, solid scientific studies which clearly make the connection you are making. I just see wild, far-fetched theories based on personal experiences on the dating market.

____

**My opinion:**

* Assholes will be assholes, regardless of where they come from

* Crime committed by a few members of a ethnic or religious group does not qualify to discredit the whole group.

* Arab men have a different socialisation than Europeans have had. We have to explain these differences to those wishing to stay here and punish and deport those who do not comply.  

* Effective control of the inner and outer borders of the European Union to exactly know who is coming and for which reasons.

* Differentiation between economic migration and refugees.

* Spreading hate spawns more hate on the receiving side.

* ***Empathy, motherfuckers, do you speak it?***

_____

**Lessons learned:**

* Censorship and ""political correctness"" are fucked up. Discussion needs freedom of speech and the ability to think about controversial opinions without condemning them. 
* Think about your own prejedices before posting (Have you met and talked with refugees/muslims? On what are you basing your opinion? Self-reflection is the key word here.)
*  Do not base a discussion about the migrant crisis upon kitchen-sink psychology.

Looking forward to an open discussion - and keep in mind - I consider myself a supporter of RP mentality.

I will do, or try to do , what I said I will do. I do not lie, I do not steal, I am non-violent (only self defense)

If I agree to monogamy, then I am monogamous. It is my principle, my word, my bond, my self. What comes out of my mouth *is* myself, and because I like myself, because I am proud of myself, because I work hard on myself - gym, work, hobbies, study, self-knowledge etc. What person who worked hard this day, who got up early, who took time out to study, who lived a long and full day, what person who was proud of who they are would allow something that did not represent themselves - a lie - to come out of their mouth? I would not dirty my mouth with falsity

Women are not principled; what they say and their actions are **not** related

Their actions/desires are based upon how they feel, and how they feel is changeable. Monogamy, marriage, boyfriend, principles, are *meaningless* to the majority of women, because it is not their driving force. A person with true principles can never be swayed, whereas any married woman can be swayed by an Alpha with the right moves.

Society raises us to believe that women are more truthful than men, the more honest of the sexes, the more righteous. Homer Simpson is a fat lazy liar who is lucky to be blessed with Marge, the God fearing pillar of truth and perfection without whom the family would go in to meltdown. What lies we were told growing up!

The next time a girl tells you ""I have a boyfriend"", remember that if the right Alpha comes along, she will go with him regardless; it is your job to be that Alpha. If your girl/wife tells you she wont cheat, it is only until her feelings change when a higher status male comes along, jangling his car keys, and she will go with him *and* most likely blame *you* for ""making her leave"" because you didnt pay enough attention .... and society will back her up.

ps. I can imagine how this post seems like a guy being bitter, so for clarity id like to state for the record, I have never been cheated on, but I have been the guy who took married women and those who had ""boyfriends"". And this is why I find that women are completely unprincipled! I have never cheated, nor would I, because I have principles!

This isn't what The Red Pill that I once knew is truly about. 

What disappoints me is that the idea of ""going your own way"" isn't exactly going your own way, regardless of how you try to rationalize it. It's a form of submission. Someone who has decided to ""go their own way"" has likely experienced some severe difficulties with women to get to that point. We've all been there at different stages in life. 

But here's the thing: By choosing to ""go your own way,"" **you aren't actually going your own way.** You're letting your difficulties and hardships with women overcome your true desires. 

You're essentially saying ""Women are stupid and I'm done with them. I don't need them to live a happy and successful life. I can just masturbate and work hard forever and I'll be fine.""

Taking the redpill IS going your own way in life, because it's about achieving everything that you want. This lifestyle is for the rare men who want it all. And which heterosexual men don't want to have sex with beautiful women?

P.S. I realize that going your own way can be effective in the short-term. Maybe if you're starting a business or just busy with life. But I don't like excuses. I mean there are always opportunities to conquer life, stay fit, and have safe sex. ",930,4.0,0.3303000032901764,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
931,3jejin,"Single mothers are complete and utter mother fucking subhuman scum 99.9% of the time. If she's not a widow, she's scum. The statistics for kids raised by single mothers shows all manner of dysfunction (poverty, mental illness, crime) for kids raised by single mothers, but not widows. So as far as I'm concerned widows are cool it's not their fault the dad died, they're not making bad decisions but shit happens.

But single mothers - they play the victim angle like a motherfucker and all the SJWs/politically correct bluepillers make the wild fucking assumption that it's not the woman's fault, revoking all agency or blame from the dumb silly bitch who chose to raise a kid alone. But the sheep don't see it like that, they start making all these wild accusations that the father was probably abusive or violent and that's why she raised the kid alone.

It's presumed the mother is a victim of circumstance even though 99% of the time she created the circumstances she's in not only for herself, but for her kid(s.) And it's presumed the father is an asshole, but most the time he was a horny guy begged not to use a condom and told she was on the pill when she wasn't. So she gets pregnant and keeps the kid. Sometimes these guys don't even know they have a kid until they get a child support notice out of thin air. Then the poor guy gets fucking berated for being a deadbeat when all he did was fuck a woman under the presumption it was recreational sex and that no baby would be born.

If bitches are deceiving guys into fatherhood, and then crying victim when it backfires because he refuses to defer to her deceit, tough shit for her. The only victim here as far as I'm concerned is the child. She tricked the guy she fucked, tried to force him to become a parent, and when he wouldn't, tried to ruin his reputation and extract wealth. That is some fucked up shit. But hardly anybody sees it from that perspective, do they? Naturally, bitches be crazy and society is all jumped up on the sycophancy of feminism and the woman are wonderful effect, so she's blameless and he's just a cunt. People are so single-minded and intent on blaming the father it's unbelievable. If your father is never there for you growing up, there's a good fucking chance that's your mothers fault.

But no, everyone acts like she's this marvellous creature for forcing her kid(s) to struggle for THEIR ENTIRE LIVES. And that the guy is probably some dark triad woman/kid abusing asshole.

It's total fucking bullshit. Very few men are violent or abusive, that's complete lying utter horseshit used to smear the male name and justify the child abuse that is raising kids without a father.

No, the truth is, mummy was somebody's plate/one night stand and thought it would be a wise idea to not use protection AND THEN keep the kid. Her body, her choice, right? Does this oft gloated feminist principle not fucking extend to the responsibility of giving and raising life too?

It makes me sick how everybody rallies to the aid of single mothers and exclaims how hard they have it and how everyone should feel sorry for them. Fuck that. Fuck them. They had a choice didn't they? I mean a whore has a fucking choice to take a pill, or get an implant or terminate. Or a million other things. The kid had no fucking choice to be born and go through all the dysfunction that awaits it. The kid is a total innocent and the mother, a cunt.

I reserve all my sympathy for the boys and (to some extent, the girls) who grow up fatherless and fucking despise the child-abusing fucks that single mothers are. They are total fucking scum contributing to the complete and utter degeneracy of our society morally, spiritually, socially and economically. Total fucking scum. **Again, it is total bullshit that the huge amount of kids who have no father all had asshole fathers who abused the mother/kid when most men in society are complete fucking betas.** That's just not plausible. This is simple female blame-shifting mixed with misandry.

I have 0% empathy for these broads. How the fuck can I when I see how they destroy their children? Only the children are blameless. Their sons are welcome on TRP and their daughters, RPW. If you are the son of a single mother, don't worry. We got you. And single mothers who for whatever reason read TRP, you're like HIV - a fucking pathogen.

**EDIT: just to be clear, that 99.9% figure is exaggerated, it's not exact. It was my way of saying ""the majority"" - do not be so literal. Factor in some context, it's a rant after all.**

Yesterday after a weeks vacation I had ants in my pants. The buzz of drinking everyday, and partying I was bored at home after work. It was 9pm. I read through comments on a post I did regarding where to meet ""non club sluts.""

Many suggested Yoga. So I went for a drive after chilling out, eating and reading I wanted to get out.

I drove down to a yoga place, and right there on reception was beautiful blonde. We flirted like crazy. I asked her about the classes, turns out she lived near me it was amazing.

She gave me the most amazing advice regarding yoga and stuff, and she was 24 and fit and toned. She doesn't drink and hardly goes clubbing (apparently). She looked healthy, vibrant it was astonishing.

THen all the yoga students there came out in force. Happy, chilled, healthy looking people. I signed up to a weekly class. Beats sitting on my ass after work and the gym.

Sadly I got massively cockblocked by the female yoga teacher, so the woman on the front desk will have to be approached next time I go.

Then afterwards I drove to my brothers to pick something up from him. We had a laugh and then I came back.

I upload my tinder etc new matches, new women messaging me, because I drove 20 minutes out of my radius.

My point is I got off my ass, I went for a drive, I cold approached a very hot blonde, and ""met"" new girls on tinder because my phone was on the move.

At times of boredom, or you are chasing a bit of excitement go for a drive. Discover new things. Meet new people.

Without you realizing it, even on a night out, tinder in the background is matching you with girls left, right and centre. Aswell as the beautiful women you chat to face to face.

Edit: Move your ass, and you'll be surprised what you'll find out there. It won't come knocking on your door.

933,4ilksg,"I look at TRP much like I look at the NRA. A good start to spreading information and ideas, even sometimes bringing them together and making them happen. But ultimately the TRP can sometimes be little more than a circle jerk. It happens, as with all things. 

Plus there are those who try to find some ""good"" in the TRP as it applies to society and people. I think that's a waste of time. It's fine to wear a mask of fakeness and deceit while among the masses. Most people can't handle the truth of human nature or its implications and that's we are so ready and wanting to dress it up in ideals and falsehoods that we call morality and religion. 

Remember, humans at their base are animals that follow mammalian pattern by and large. We've just put a fancy spin on being an evolved ape and dressed it up with the artifices of civilization, religion, and subjective morality. 

You need to become the best predator you can be as most people are prey. Acquiring physical prowess and monetary ability enhances your ability to be selective in garnering mates and resources. Sitting on your ass playing video games and eating Doritos is the pathway to heart disease, celibacy, and erectile dysfunction. Look for the smart and easy ways to big things and make money. Let suckers, BP, and betas do the hard work, sweating, and preferably dying. They are a virtually unlimited resource as long as they get their cable TV, sugary foods, and religion on Sundays they don't do anything with or about besides going to a church and thinking that's what god wants while they engage in unbridled apathy to their fellow human beings. Lemmings are at least honest and thus deserve more respect than these types. 

Stop looking for answers in the offerings of professional entertainers, that's what Lemmings and betas do. Start working on creating your own answers and offerings. Start building your skill and ability base. Don't settle in at a company and punch a clock because one day the company many realize you are overpaid and better off being replaced (for them anyways, fuck you). 

The greatest men never settled for a 9-5 or did things the ""traditional way"" (i.e. Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, Temujin, etc. etc. [yes I realize I just named a bunch of genocidal murdering guys, it's how history works typically]). They innovated, took chances, and made themselves into something great. An Xbox One won't do that for you. 

Be the object in motion, gaining mass and energy. When others are sitting in a bar rotting, be at the gym or be learning a new skill and ability. Don't let your employers define you beyond the money they hand you. They are too inferior to matter ultimately. 

And above all else. Only God, a judge, and a jury of your peers can judge you, and that's ultimately up to you to decide (unless God is real, because if God is real, you and I might be Grade A+++ fucked). Worthless people will always seek to have influence and power over your life. Don't let them, there's no need to. If they don't put money in your hand, power in life, or pussy in your bed (and/or dick, hey everyone has their thing), they don't even begin to mean anything. They are worth less than the dirt on the bottom of your shoes. Accept it and take joy in it. 

Life can be hard, life tends to be unfair to most people, and tragedy does await most as well. Have fun, fuck the world, and get yours. Because there is either a God and setup of divine judgment or there isn't. And if there isn't, then fuck those atheists, they are edible. 

One thing I enjoy telling some people is ""I'm honest, I'm ethical, and I'm evil."" Or if I'm feeling really cheek ""the only thing keeping me from becomming a cannibal serial killer is my legal license."" Both of which are sort of true, and sort of false, just depends on the day I guess. 

TRP is where you start, but how you finish? Well that's up to you really. Don't wait on others for answers, at best they'll offer some direction but no results.

# 

Such a thoroughly-weaponized and yet nonsensical term.

What men actually *hate* women? Seriously, where the fuck are these dudes?  Sure some men might be frustrated, and yes, even *angry* at women.  But hate? Seething, desire-to-destroy-and-humiliate **hatred?** It's laughable bullshit.

As men, we literally depend upon women biologically for the continuation of the species; hatred of them would be antithetical to our existence. The capacity to express any malice or violence toward women has been so thoroughly bred out of men over the ages **that we instinctively gang up and beat the shit out of a man who hits a woman, even if we've never met her before.** The men who are here on TRP aren't looking for an outlet for hatred or malice; men don't seek emotional outlets. They seek solutions. They seek a fix for unrequited desire. A need for acceptance, and yes, validation from women. It's very possible to be frustrated and even resentful of women because of that unfulfilled desire.  But hateful?  No.

**One cannot truly hate something while desiring it simultaneously.**

Like many terms that are feminist in origin, ""misogyny"" is emotionally-charged, broadly- and ambiguously-defined, and conveniently unfalsifiable.  It's the perfect recipe for **power talk.**  The reality is that what is ""sexist"" or ""misogynist"" varies enormously not only depending on what was said, but what man said it, what women heard it, and how those women perceive that man.  An actual, objective standard for what the term means **does not exist**.

In practice, the only definition for misogyny that women can universally agree on is ""things men do that I don't like"".  Maybe some component of a woman labeling a man a ""misogynist"" is actually rooted in her belief that he hates women, but the true message is in the **subtext** of the statement.  When a woman calls a man a ""misogynist"", what she's really communicating is that that man is not attractive or worthy enough to poke fun at women or ""get away"" with being offensive.  It has very little to do with addressing what is hateful and unjust; it's just women's way of sounding alarm bells at the sight of a man they perceive as bitter, or frustrated, or even angry with women, and thus demonstrably undesirable.  This term is used to make that assertion clearly, but without any **accountability** attached to it (which, of course, is a big no-no for most women).

""Misogyny"" isn't women *actually* being worried that a bunch of men secretly hate them and are out to get them.  It's just hypergamy in action.  It's women sussing out which men are worth fucking and which aren't, and then stating it out loud, but without any overt attachment to the statement.  It's rarely ever an indictment of a behavior itself, but of the man doing the behavior; a feeble and bratty attempt at a character assassination.  Treat it like any other petty insult from someone who's butthurt and emotional, and refuse to take it seriously.  Accuse her of being a Martian invader in a human skin suit, or one of those kleptomaniacs who steals the tops off of spray bottles.

The real tragedy here is that all of this crying-wolf over gendered ""offenses"" misses the forest for the trees, and with real and dire social consequences.  For women, real misogyny, true hatred of that which is feminine, **comes from within.**

The only misogyny that anyone should ever be worried about arrives secondhand, from the collective voice of the chubby, blue-haired masses, bankrolled and publicized by the Great American Church of Consumerism, whose response to rejection from the men they desire is never to look inward and improve, but to bleat long and loud, ""Men are evil. Reject everything they have built for you, for it will only keep you down. Pretend you have a penis, and this will solve all of your problems.""

This voice is the true enemy of women; the true source of the conspiratorial **hatred** which they so fear.  The one that, in the midst of the ever-growing gender-equalist narrative put forth by popular culture and media, the majority of women simply accept and let influence their life choices, because on a superficial level **it seems like it feels right.**  The one that compels them, one Huffpost article, one snide, passive-aggressive comment, and one affirmative action STEM hiring quota at a time, that happiness and fulfillment are to be found in mindlessly struggling against their biological programming, and against a life that would otherwise grant them meaning and contentment.",934,4.0,0.476500004529953,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

What's interesting is, in recent years the age at which the average person gets married has been ever increasing.

People get used to married right out of teenager hood at the young age of 20. Now people are waiting until they are 25. 

* Marriage Age Chart: http://i.imgur.com/xoYrpcZ.png

You would think people getting married older would lead to less divorce. However, I don't think age is necessarily linked to divorce, nor does it prevent divorce. At least, not in a way that is significant.

Rather the statistics show a few different connections:

* Women's Suffrage and cultural ""empowerment"" is tied to divorce.
* The divorce rate is directly tied to the marriage rate. 

Let's look at the statistics and history:

-------
United Kingdom
--------

* 1918 - In the UK Women's Suffrage was put in place. Women over the age of 30 were allowed to vote.
* 1928 - In the UK full Women's Suffrage was granted and any legal adult woman could vote. 

Now look at this chart and notice when divorce started spiking: ~1918

------
United States
------

* 1890 - The National Women Suffrage Association and the American Women Suffrage Association merge to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). As the movement's mainstream organization, NAWSA wages state-by-state campaigns to obtain voting rights for women.
* 1893 - Colorado is the first state to adopt an amendment granting women the right to vote. Utah and Idaho follow suit in 1896, Washington State in 1910, California in 1911, Oregon, Kansas, and Arizona in 1912, Alaska and Illinois in 1913, Montana and Nevada in 1914, New York in 1917; Michigan, South Dakota, and Oklahoma in 1918.
* 1913 - Alice Paul and Lucy Burns form the Congressional Union to work toward the passage of a federal amendment to give women the vote. The group is later renamed the National Women's Party. Members picket the White House and practice other forms of civil disobedience.
* 1919 - The federal woman suffrage amendment, originally written by Susan B. Anthony and introduced in Congress in 1878, is passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is then sent to the states for ratification.

Now look at this chart and see the first spike in divorce immediately following actions by Women's Suffrage, in particular 1920 right after national voting was allowed for women.

Both Marriage & Divorce now on the decline
----
Did the role reversal introduced by feminism lead to better and more successful marriages? And as shown here: http://i.imgur.com/NsDpdBE.png you'll see that roles haven't really reversed much at all. More couples have both partners working than ever before, but the number of couples where the woman becomes the breadwinner so the husband can stay home - hasn't increased. Role reversals and the ""stay-at-home-dad"" are fiction or fringe cases.

Co-habitation and No Union (niether living together or married) are on the rise. Marriage is now at an all time low per capita, and divorce is in decline, but I believe that is only because marriage is also.

This failure and lack of marriages however, is leading an entire generation of children being raised by a single parent - which results in lower quality children who turn out to be lower quality adults. [TheAtlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/03/the-decline-of-marriage-and-the-rise-of-unwed-mothers-an-economic-mystery/274111/) ran a piece on this not long ago. 

The other problem is that women don't want to marry men that are lower status than they are. [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/trevorbutterworth/2013/06/25/whats-behind-the-us-decline-in-marriage-pragmatism/) ran a piece on this without actually saying it too directly:
>All the talk of recession and culture and cohabitation and education is a way of avoiding talking about the economic collapse of an entire class of American male.

As a bonus, here's some information confirming ""The Wall."" Many more young women are not getting married, but older women are getting married about just as much even with the declining marriage rate.

>In recent years, there has been a growing difference in marriage rates by age and by ethnic group.6 Fewer and fewer women are marrying in their twenties. Among women 20 to 24 years of age in 1975, 63% had married, while in 1990, only 39% of women in the same age group had married. For women 25 to 29 years of age, these percentages dropped from 87% in 1975 to 69% in 1990; rates dropped from 93% to 82% for women 30 to 34, 96% to 89% for women 35 to 39, and from 96% to 92% for women 40 to 44.

[The Wall for divorcees](http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=63&articleid=408&sectionid=2781): 

>Younger women are more likely than older women to remarry, but age is not associated with remarriage among men.

---------------

So how is this last part all related to women voting? Well it isn't directly. But it is related to something similar. Women's cultural influence and social power.

* Under the presidency of Bill Clinton, women won many wars on the home front. The Violence Against Women Act and the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE) were both passed; and women began earning 71 cents for every dollar paid to men, a substantive increase from the decade before. Carol Moseley Braun became the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate; Janet Reno became U.S. Attorney General; and Madeleine Albright was appointed the first female U.S. Secretary of State, making her the highest-ranking woman in the United States government.
* While internationally, women were rising to Heads of State at lightning speed with France, Bangladesh, Canada, Turkey, and New Zealand all electing their first female prime ministers.
* 2000-2005 - Several countries granted voting rights to women for the first time, including Kuwait and Bahrain, and elected women to the highest ranks of state—among the most notable was the election of Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to president of Liberia, making her Africa's first elected female leader. In Germany, Angela Merkel became the country's first female chancellor; Michelle Bachelet was sworn in as Chile's first female president; and in the U.S., Condoleezza Rice became the first woman to serve as U.S. National Security Advisor.
* 2006 - Nancy Pelosi was the first woman elected Speaker of the House in the U.S. House of Representatives, which places her just two seats from the presidency.

So far, since women have started entering official government positions, the only thing that the government has accomplished is marriage for gays and the outlaw of polygamy:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_civil_marriage_in_the_United_States  
While same-sex marriage was an admirable ideal, it only helps out a minority. Nothing has been done in the last decade to support the majority of the population in fixing the decline of straight marriage. The polygamy issue was at worst a red herring, and I can't see why anyone would focus on legislation for that when there are actual problems to solve.

Further [*this*](http://dontmarry.wordpress.com/) is the legal and cultural climate that men who engage in marriage have to deal with today. All thanks to ""empowered"" women. 

In conclusion, Women's Suffrage was the beginning of the end of marriage. In the mid and late 1800s before women could vote, the divorce rate was nearly non-existent. As female influence increased, the divorce rate increased. It reached a peak in 1979 and hasn't come down any quicker than the marriage rate has since.

**BEGINNINGS**

I believe for most men, their values and ideology are formed while they are teenage boys in middle school and high school. I think most feminist/soyboy losers are the ones who were outcasts in school, or the ones who would be ""stuffed into lockers"" by the popular kids. They were not a part of the popular crowd. They didn't play sports and they weren't athletically gifted. They participated in fringe activities like video games, dungeons and dragons, band, and other ""nerd"" activities. Their friends were also in the same boat. 

These men had utter disdain for the popular crowd in their school. They were mad the popular crowd got the attention, the accolades, the trophies, and most importantly, the attention of the highest value women. They were mad that the praise went to guys who accomplished things like playing sports well, instead of intellectual accomplishments. 

However, they know damn well if they had the ability, they would have been perfectly fine with being an athletic achiever and winning those trophies, medals, and glory. They are just jealous it wasn't them. 

**THE QUESTION**

""Why the fuck are these women paying so much attention to these jock losers instead of me? I actually achieve things. I get good grades, I participate in sophisticated, intellectual hobbies, and am just intellectually superior to these guys. Fuck them!"" They would think to themselves.

These guys knew they were never going to complete with Chad on the playing ground of athletics, or strength, or looks, or size, or masculinity, or any of that. Therefore, the soyboy realized the only way he could gain the upper ground on Chad was by claiming the moral high ground. They go the ultra liberal, SJW route and now can claim some form of superiority over Chad. 

**THE MORAL HIGH GROUND**

""He may have all the medals and trophies, but I am a better human being because I care, you see""

Now armed with a newfound sense of moral superiority to go with his intellectual superiority, the SJW soyboy now attempts to compete in the sexual market place with this ""ace"" up his sleeve. However, he gets the same results. Most high value women aren't interested. Even the lower value women aren't really that interested. The soyboy can only dismiss these women who reject him as ""basic bitches who don't know what they want"" for so long. 

Instead of realizing the fault in his ways, the soyboy believes its because he isn't progressive enough, isn't feminist enough, isn't ""woke"" enough. He decides to double, triple, quadruple down on his liberal feminist SJW ideology. This causes it to literally become a religion for him. 

**LINKAGE**

The liberal feminist soyboy now links everything he hates - to conservative ideology. The popular crowd at school? They must be evil conservatives. The jocks? I hate them, therefore they must be hateful bigots. He paints his real life opposition in the same light as his political opposition. Therefore, the way to crush them is politically. Not only is his hyper liberal feminist SJW ideology going to save the world and usher in utopia, its also going to crush his enemies from high school. He will finally get his revenge from getting stuffed into lockers by these guys and those guys stealing the girls. 

**THE MISSION**

When your political views are literally your religion like they are for liberal SJW feminists, if you do not hold the same political views, you must be evil. You must be hateful. How could you possibly hold such horrible views that are not inline with my ~~religion~~ political views? Therefore, the mission must be to save the world from such views ""for the greater good"".

You must be re-educated. We must show you the truth. All forms of dissent must be silenced so no more minds are corrupted. We can not have people on this planet with such backward views. 

Tactics employed via the mission are doxxing people, joining groups like Antifa, blackmailing people, running social justice outrage campaigns, protesting, getting people fired from their jobs for wrongthink, and so on. 

If they do the mission correctly, they will be praised by their fellow SJWs and a fawning media. This will give them the glory and heroic dopamine rush they have always craved and missed out on by not being good at sports in high school. 

**THE PROBLEM WITH THE MISSION**

The problem with The Mission, is that its not motivated by compassion. Christian Evangelicals, for example, when they want to preach the gospel and win people over to Christianity, its done out of love and compassion(for most evangelicals anyway). For these hyper SJW liberal feminists, though, its not done out of compassion. It's done out of vengeance. Disdain. Hate. If they win people over to their side, great, but its more about revenge and payback. It's about destroying the guys who they hated in high school. Everything they hate politically becomes a proxy stand in for their high school enemies and oppressors. They are one in the same. This dopamine rush of revenge is far sweeter than the one for nobility. 

**HOW BIG TECH TIES IN**

Big tech ties in perfectly here. Let's be real. Most big tech workers were the nerds in high school. They were the oppressed. They were the ones stuffed in lockers. Now they are armed with all this power. Whether it be reddit admins, reddit power mods, Google admins, Facebook moderators, you name it. They have the power to really make a difference for ""The Mission"" that the normal person can't. They can ban people, censor ideologies and ideas, deplatform people, and silence ideology they don't like. Because they link ideology they don't like to their high school oppressors, it gives them satisfactory revenge, as well as making them appear noble to their fellow like minded individuals and as if they are ""saving the world"". Example, they will use platitudes like ""Muh, if you could have stopped Hitler, muh, would you have done whatever you could?""

I guarantee you the individuals who quarantined TRP and The\_Donald did it because they view us as a representation of their high school oppressors. Yeah, they could brag to their fellow SJW friends and the fawning media about what they did, to get the nobility ""heroic"" dopamine rush that they could never get in school by playing sports. But that's not as satisfying as the revenge dopamine rush they get from it. The dopamine rush they get for finally getting ""even"" with their high school oppressors and the ones who got the girls instead of them.",939,3.0,0.4641000032424927,"people, feminist, sex, year, well, live, actually, let, question, great"

Almost everyone has heard of ""cat ladies"" or women who own multiple cats being crazy.

Gentlemen I would like to introduce you to something to always consider, especially if she has a cat or cats.

Toxoplasmosis makes women crazy.  Batshit crazy.  You won't know she has it, only that it lasts a long time and is hard for the body to get rid of.  During that time she will appear to be nuts. Fly off on tantrums, crying, irrational thought, jealousy, you name it.  (sound familiar?)  It affects men, too. It makes us aggressive and also nuts, but appears to affect us less.  The extent is unclear.

If they are outdoor cats, chances are they have killed mice or other rodents. Rodents affected by Toxoplasma Gondii will exhibit weird behavior.  They will show no fear when confronted with a cat.  Normally sight of a cat would send them scurrying.  With toxoplasmosis, they offer themselves as food.  That's how the cat contracts it.

If the cat ever brings the carcass in and/or poops in a litter box or even the bush under the bedroom window, chances are that loony girl you've plated has acute Toxoplasmosis. Run.

I honestly think it's the [root cause of a majority of mental health problems](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090311085151.htm) in the world and has yet to be linked.  Why?  Because it doesn't have a huge affect (death or major sickness), it's hard to detect unless you look for it, and it results in HUGE pharmaceutical sales.  There's a lot of financial incentive for keeping it under wraps.

941,bd56qi,"There is nothing more pathetic than a man who ego lifts at the gym.

For those of you who don't know what ego lifting is,

>Ego lifting is someone who sadly gives a fuck about what others think of them at the gym, and loads more weight on the bar than they are capable of handling just so they can be seen by others ""lifting"" as much weight as they can get away with. 

Notice ""lifting"" in quotation marks. Yeah you might be able to do the minimum it takes to ""lift"" said weight, but at what cost? Your form sucks, you didn't do enough reps, you didn't do the right lift, and so on.

I see ego lifters every day at the gym. Doing way more weight than they can handle. Doing curls where they throw their shoulders backward so hard and have their elbows out in front of their body so far that they are getting zero bicep activation at all and turning it into a front deltoid workout. 

Or squatting 1/4 of the way down. Or dead lifting with a rounded back that looks like a question mark. Or using all the momentum they possibly can to bring the bar down on lat pulldowns. Turning incline bench/incline DB bench into a flat bench by moving their ass forward and arching their back. Turning overhead presses into a push press.  You get the idea.

A good prescription for being an insecure ego lifting faggot is to try out the Vince Gironda 8x8 system. 

#8 sets of 8 reps.... with 15 seconds of rest

Vince Gironda was an old school body builder who called this system ""the honest workout"" Your ego will quickly be crushed with this workout program. Because in order to do 8 sets of 8 with only 15 seconds or rest, you can't be doing a lot of weight.

Run it for 6 weeks. If you want to ease into it, take the first week and do 30 seconds of rest instead of 15 to get the tempo down, and calibrate the weight you can handle. Then in week 2, go down to 20 seconds. Weeks 3-6, 15 seconds. I guarantee you the initial weights you choose will be too heavy. That's how it was for me. You think you are picking a light weight, and then you realize you can't finish the 8 sets of 8 and have to go lower next time. 

It's not just 8 sets of 8, its 8 sets of 8 with good form. If you have to compromise your form at any point except maybe the last rep or two on the last set, its too heavy. 

Barbell curling 20 pounds? Dumbell curling 10 pounds? Squatting 135? Overhead Pressing only the bar? Neck Pressing only 115 pounds? Having to use the assist pad on pull ups/chin ups? If the thought of doing any of that makes you shudder because *gasp* people might think you are weak, the 8x8 system will put that mindset to rest. I can do 20+ chin ups easily in a single set. But in an 8x8 I have to do them assisted. Oh no, people are seeing me do assisted chin ups, oh no! How will I survive?

Here are the lifts I do when I run this program:

Monday: Gironda Neck Press, Wide Grip Dips, Overhead Press, Lateral Raise, Lying Tricep Extension, Smith Machine Reverse Grip Bench

Tuesday: Wide Grip Lateral Pulldown, Assisted Chin Ups, Drag Curls, Spider Curls, Reverse Grip Barbell Curls, Forearm Wrist Curls

Wednesday: Squat, Hack Squat, Leg Curls, Standing Calf Raises, Cable Ys, Barbell Shrugs

Thursday: Incline DB Press, Cable Crossovers, Standing DB Press, Kneeling Face Pulls, Rope Tricep Pushdowns, Overhead Rope Tricep Extensions

Friday: Chest Supported Row, Assisted Pull Up, Barbell Curl, Incline DB Curl, Reverse Grip DB Curl, Reverse Grip Wrist Curls

Saturday: Leg Press, Glute Ham Raise, Seated Calf Raise, Hang Clean, Prone Press

Sunday: OFF

Chad was a smart kid in school, second only to how popular he was with everyone. He won the genetic lottery and was objectively the best looking, most athletic and physically appealing kid in high school at 6'4"" and 190lbs at 8% bodyfat. The girls gosspied and giggled with each other because he was great in bed and could make them orgrasm with his 7"" girthy dick alone. That girl you oogled at in chemistry because she was cute? Chad fucked her.

In college he took home a 9 every night he wanted, had threesomes with them on the weekends for a total n-count well into the 100s (he's not sure because he stopped counting around 90), yet still got a 4.0 GPA taking 20+ hours a semester and playing on the football team.

He's now a major player in the oil and gas industry. As a salesman he took home a million his first year (and his first 18 year old supermodel), won accolades from his coworkers and bosses and was well liked by everyone, especially the coworkers he was banging. Despite every girl he's ever fucked chasing him he refuses to commit thanks to fresh 18 year olds to alpha-widow every year for the rest of his life.

Men get discouraged knowing they will never be Chad. Regretting the years in high school and college, forever losing the chance to be the popular guy and athlete, or blindly searching for power and the way to bankroll six or seven figures in the business world, they give up and resort to a life of gray non-existence.

944,1clik0,"I come from a reasonably respected and in some cases rather religious family, where we all grew up in England but are from the Med.

I grew up to arguements constantly with my parents, which hurt, and I grew up thinking that women deserved great respect in all accounts. 

My aunt (mums sister) would always advice my mum and comfort her when she'd fight with my dad, only now I realise that the aunt is 55 single, never been married and is clearly jealous as she often starts all rifts herself!

Take my two cousins. Both beautiful funny lovely girls. Both 35 years old, no bfs, no marital prospects. Both ended long relationships because they deserved BETTER. Found fuck all, and are both bat shit crazy.

My uncle and aunt got seperated a few years back because my uncle was in fact cheating on my aunt (other aunt). My aunt was left to look after her two kids, to which the older one hates his mum as she let out all her anger on him. He popped the pill at 20 that kid! The uncle got bored, moved back into his house as if nothing had happened. He goes on several holidays a year ALONE. ALONE!

Last week, she broke down in her car, and he drives a nice BMW. He heard about it, and told his son to hide his car keys so she doesnt drive his car as shes an awful driver, and to get a cab and bus to places instead. (He was on holiday!)

My grandfather(lastly) is 83, and my grandmother died two years ago (may she RIP).

However, the man goes to the casino every night. He goes out till 10-11pm and comes home alone, barely speaks english. He even did this when he was married. He got abuse for it, but carried on. He didnt give a shit, and still doesnt. Last week we went to his house to see him before going to wembley to watch the football, he thought he was coming, he wasnt, so he fucked off to the casino.

Now you have to understand, when these things happen, we are told a very different story. By my mum who drummed it in ""isnt your grandfather selfish...isnt your uncle an arsehole she should divorce him....why cant your cousins find a husband?....why dont we invite your single aunt on holiday because shes all alone...""

3. My single aunt is an EXTREME example of the cousins. Her fussyness has driven her to lunacy and boredom.

945,7m92wb,"A quick field report.  

I was on vacation last week and returning from Hawaii on Christmas Eve.  We were deplaning our connecting flight in LA, and a short woman in front of us was struggling to get down a piece of luggage.  She looked plaintively around, surrounded by perhaps ten men- and **EVERY SINGLE MAN LOOKED AWAY OR AT THE FLOOR.**

My wife was still sitting and she crossly demanded that I help the woman- ""Blue, she needs help getting her bag down.""

I shrugged and quietly informed her that I did not want to get charged with sexual harassment so she was on her own.  One of the men in front of me nodded vigorously and my wife frowned deeply.  She was no taller than the woman but she got up and tried to help her and, of course, she could not reach the bag either.

""Can you help PLEASE!""  She demanded.

I smiled grimly:  ""Of course I will help YOU, my dear, but I don't know this woman or her intentions."" Then I darkly muttered ""Me Too Darling.  A man's got to protect himself from toxic femininity"" as I took down her bag and set it in front of the woman without even a glance at her.  This time I was loud enough for everyone around to hear and several of the men continued to look at the floor while grinning and nodding.  Several of the women looked at me with piercing eyes full of hate and fear.  I calmly shrugged my shoulders.  Pray tell exactly how these bitches expect men to react!

I have flown regularly for many decades and I have never witnessed a scene like this.  A woman desperately needed help and all the men around her simply looked away and refused to help.  Then all of the men nodded and smiled when I said the magic words ""Me Too.""

Women are programmed to push men and push and push and push and push.  Men are supposed to stop them.  However, at some point an individual woman pushes her husband just a bit to far or, as in this case, the group of howling feminazis as a whole have pushed men as a whole too far.  In either case the response of men is not to fight back or hit the women, or grab them by the POTUS.  The natural response of a man who has been pushed one step to far is to withdraw.  Like a husband denied sex one to many times by his wife, or talked to with disrespect one to many times, men today are withdrawing from women.  

Men today are consciously limiting contact with women.  Increasingly we don't talk to them.  We don't even make eye contact.  If they need help we fight our White Knight urges to help the ""fairer"" sex and instead  look at the floor and remember toxic masculinity.  We remember Me Too.  We remember the ungrateful, pushy, demanding, bitchy, cunty women exhibiting toxic feminism, treating us like second class citizens, denying us jobs in favor of affirmative action, and constantly testing us in never ending and escalating ways.

We are looking at all this and increasingly men are saying:  ""Nope.  I am good.""

TLDR: # ME TOO is working!   # MGTOW4LIFE

Edit:  I reviewed this with my wife and she noted that the woman asked 2 men for help and they ignored her.  That was why she was so compelled to jump in and help- and it makes my point even stronger!  There is a response brewing and men are sick and tired of ~~this shit~~ women.

Edit 2:  I thought this scenario sounded familiar.  Dalrock wrote about this in 2014:

946,2vo6od,"Sometimes I find it helpful, when dealing with women's irrationality, pestering, disobedience, and outright malice to think of the hierarchy in the title of this post.

For the definition of God, if you don't believe in any particular God, then use the definition of ""existence itself"" which is something you obviously can't deny--that existence exists, and that it precedes and is the necessary condition for all other things.  It is the essence of being, and makes a good philosophical placeholder for anyone who doesn't believe in any other understanding of God.

How much do we rely on God?  Or, again for atheists, how much do we rely on existence existing?   Completely and 100%.  We have nothing, we are nothing without God/existence.

This is reflected in the way a child thinks about its parents.  And especially its mother in its earliest years.  If they are out of the room, it is an existential crisis.  We can understand that.

And yet, we often have difficulty with the notion that woman's being is fundamentally as dependent on man, as a child's is on its mother, and a man's is on God/existence. (Naturally, woman and children need God/existence, too… it's a flow-chart.)

But I find this analogy can help explain the way women shit-test and say  things irrational and horrible to men.

Have you ever cursed God?  Cursed the day you were born?  Cursed the evil in the world, for which you place the blame on God, when the real culprit was Man?  Blamed God for all your shortcomings, like a whiny feminist blaming men for all of hers?

Said, or thought to God, if you do x, I'll believe in you.  If you don't, I won't.  You are more powerful, but it's only by the standards of MY tests that you should prove yourself.

Have you ever thought that existence is inherently evil or absurd?  And railed against the absurd universe, spouted off to your friends with existential angst… yet another day, you beamed in some euphoria, understanding that all existence is pure and good and you are part of it?

Are you not like a woman who hates men, and loves men.  Says she doesn't need them, and cries for days when they ignore her?

And isn't she coming to you like a child crying for Mommy?

(And did not God perhaps, for love of woman and man, come into existence as a child, through woman, to become a man, sacrificing all to  be glorified as God, making a full cycle?!)

Anyway, this is just a thought that helps me understand women better.  I wanted it to be accessible to believers and non-believers alike, because I think it's true and makes sense in the order of existence.

How many children want to be taken for big boys and big girls?  To be treated as adults?  Yet it is ridiculous when they try.  They can never do so until they grow into that.

And how many men want to be seen as Gods?  Yet their efforts are ridiculous!  A big apartment and a swimming pool.  An expensive car.  Leading a company.  Can that compare to the creation of the universe?!  We know these men are fools.

And yet how many women want to be taken for men?  Strong, rational, reading a Sheryl Sandberg book, aspiring to be a CEO, because that's what a man does.  They have no idea what a man does and they are just as ridiculous for trying as a child putting Mommy's sports bra on their head so they can dress up as Mommy.

And when a woman wails and cries against YOU… not against children, nor against God, but YOU… it is because she feels as you do when you rail against the cruel indifference of the universe, or the unanswered prayer.

While you do whatever it takes to conquer the world, no holds barred, take no prisoners because the competition is tough… that is just how she will take it to YOU, to find her meaning by conquering you.

But to be conquered by her is like her being conquered by a child.  It would show she was weak and backwards.

Thinking of this ordering, putting man and woman in the context with children and God(/bare existence) helps me see myself and my flaws in what women do, without seeing our flaws as equal.  They are just a reflection.  And her struggles with me are like my struggles with the highest order of the universe.",946,4.0,0.45190000534057617,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

What truth? The red pill truth! 

**SPOILERS AHEAD**

I've read every book, and they've provided useful insight into relationships. In the first scene, Bella (the main character), moves to a rainy town in Washington state. Right off the bat, she gets a beta orbiter, Tyler. She's immediately not attracted to him, and friendzones him. But next, she spies Edward, who she notices has a dark triad complex. Seriously, he's attractive, muscular, and most importantly, is rich as fuck.

He drives a Volkswagen to school. Lots of social status here! She starts becoming infatuated with him when Tyler almost hits her with his van, and Edward saves her using his incredible muscles. He leaves, (dread game time), pretty much ignoring her for huge amounts of time. Edward actually starts stalking her around at this point, watching her sleep. Yet she doesn't view him as a creep, (because of all of his alphaness) and proceeds to date him.

She clings to Edward for emotionally support throughout the series, attracted to the danger of him being a vampire. James, however, comes in, wanting to hunt Bella. He's the beta orbiter stereotype right there, no status, nowhere near as attractive and muscular. Constantly stalking her around, no life of his own. James is what not do be, he pretty much pedastalizes her as the ""perfect game"". 

James steals Bella, and then gets killed by Edward, who saves her. This part isn't very important, but the next book is a study of AFBB.

Bella gets a paper cut in New Moon at her birthday party (the book after Twilight), causing a vampire to try to attack her. Edward and the rest of his family move away now, because it's really dangerous if a vampire almost kills you because of a paper cut. 

Bella wants Edward back so much now, she jumps off cliffs randomly! She now meets Jacob, a really, *really*, nice guy, who comforts her throughout her ""agony"", and is overall a beta. He loves him, as a friend. Gotta love what happens next, because Jacob is now turning into a werewolf and leaves Bella to become a muscular, alpha (he is supposed to be an actual alpha in a wolf pack), high status (of course), werewolf! Bella suddenly becomes interested in him, I wonder why?

Edward somehow learns that Bella killed herself by jumping off a cliff, which is actually a funny series of miscommunications that culminates in Edward going to Italy to do a ""suicide by cop"" type thing. Edward comes back, Bella fawns all over him, all is happy again, with Bella using Jacob for lots of emotionally support and what not, and trying to get Edward to have sex with her in her spare time.

Edward starts to lose his alpha touch in book 3, when Bella constantly bugs him to go visit her ""friend"", Jacob. Tables are turned, Edward is the beta, and Jacob is the alpha. On one of her visits to Jacob, Jacob decides to tell her that he loves her. That is the shittiest piece of game I've ever seen in a book, and Bella cannot friend him fast enough.

Jacob now goes dark triad (he can't make up his mind), and decides to run around to get himself killed and is a complete psychopath. Bella falls in love with him, even though she just friend zoned him chapters before (holy shit hamster is going to break his wheel).

Unfortunately, Bella decides to choose Edward for her provider relationship, because at this point Edward is a complete beta (Bella did it), and Bella wants the beta bux.

Now, at this point, I'm at Breaking Dawn, the final book in the series. Just when you thought Edward couldn't spend more lavish amounts of money on things, he goes out onto a private island with Bella, (they got married because Edward is a fucking idiot). Lots of unprotected sex ensues, (seriously Edward, use a condom), and Bella doesn't get an STD, but gets pregnant with a vampire hybrid baby.

Unlike all of her vampire friends, Bella's hamster breaks the fucking sound barrier and she decides to keep the vampire hybrid baby. Keep in mind, her father-in-law (who was described as the greatest doctor in the world, non-sarcastically) has told her that the baby will pose a great risk to her and will probably kill her. Never trust a woman to get an abortion.

Through a banal series of events (three phone calls), Jacob is now going on a Rambo-esque quest to save Bella from becoming a vampire. He learns it was all a misunderstanding, because he actually sees her pregnant with a vampire hybrid baby who is now actively trying to kill her by breaking her bones from the inside. Jacob literally begs her to get an abortion. Hamster runs at hypersonic speeds, vaporizing the wheel as Bella tells him that she will ""probably live long enough"" to deliver the baby and then she will become a vampire.

Due to the fact that human-vampire hybrid babies are generally considered as dangerous freaks of nature who will probably kill random things, Jacob's wolf pack sets up an attack to kill the baby. At this point, Jacob starts his own wolf pack because he is sad about killing demonic vampire babies. At this point, Bella starts drinking blood (she is not a vampire yet) to feed the baby. But while she is drinking blood, she falls over, breaks her pelvis, almost every bone in her body, and her spine with help from the baby.

Edward makes her a vampire, and Jacob conveniently walks in to see (kill) the new baby. But when he sees her, the most bullshit, anti-male plot device I have ever seen in my life comes into play. It's called ""imprinting"", and I'm not kidding about this, as soon as Jacob saw the vampire baby, he is doomed to a life of beta orbiting around her.

Hamster goes into lightspeed in Bella's mind, as she tries to rationalize Jacob, her alpha person, raising a child from birth, just so he can fuck her when she's 18. Holy shit, that is disturbing. It actually turns out at this point that there's a secret hamster in every vampire mind, because years back, a bunch of vampires turned babies into vampires, and it was disturbing shit that is pretty much the holocaust for vampires. The only difference between those babies and this one is that this one is half human, half vampire. 

The vampire government comes over, scared out of their minds because Bella just hamstered away a creature outlawed for causing ""mental scars in every vampire"". At this point, the vampire hybrid baby thing turns out not to be a vampire baby, sorry if this is confusing, but Bella's baby wasn't dangerous at all, even though it pretty much killed her by breaking her spine. 

Everything ends incredibly happily, with Edward morphed into a sexless beta who Bella relies on for emotional support, Jacob is a pedophile who Bella obviously still wants, Bella doesn't do jack shit whatsoever, Edward does everything for her, and Bella's baby overwhelms any sense of happiness for anything or anybody else.

""Enough reasons why moms can't, won't and will never be the right person to raise a man. 

In addition, a father's view:
2. Choose a girlfriend who doesn't externalize her responsibility for her love life or plays the victim in your relationship. That's emotional manipulation, the default, virtually undetectable female weapon. Find a woman who won't take something away from you that is your birthright: being a man. 

3. Pee how you must, a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. Find a girlfriend who doesn't mind cleaning up your pee for no reason. Just like you bring her flowers 'for no reason'. 

5. We'll introduce your mom to: the power drill, the sawing machine, electrical circuits, phone chargers, tire changing skills, her muscles to open jars & carry the garbage & grocery bags etc. Then teach her how to USE THEM. 

6. Look around you, there is no god. Men AND women can be spiritual leaders. 

7. There will be times when you have to knock someone into respecting you or your boundaries. Never fear resorting to that, as.a.last.resort. This includes women who provoke you into using physical reactions. You can never hit a woman, but you can throw or hurl one (to defend your boundaries), if she deserves it. 

9. Choose a girl who: knows her rights AND knows her OBLIGATIONS; who knows, honors and respects men and doesn't bitch, ever. Why? Because bitching behavior never decreases. Totally ignore every woman who ever bitches. There actually are women who think all they have is equal rights, never equal RESPONSIBILITIES. 
9a. Watch out for women who hit the wall around 35, they're mostly looking for spermdonors. 

10. Take pride in your own taste of style, I'll guide you. After that, never take a woman's advice, women tend to want to dress you up and then whine about them having to look after a man who has no taste. 

11. Know when to be strong, and when to be tender. Never ever fear going against a woman's will or tears when you think you're right. There are women who actually think the world is supposed to accommodate every single feeling and emotion they have. Lmao. 

12. There are things very few women can do like: being goal or solution oriented, lift shit, manage their panic or feelings of entitlement, stabilize their emotions, think rationally all the time, ignore what other people think, hyperfocus, enjoy a stable and healthy self-esteem, teach a boy to become a man. There are women who think 'equality and mutual respect' means 'privileges - for women only'. 

14. A man is allowed to adjust or scratch his junk just like women are allowed to adjust or scratch their boobs. Pay no mind to women who tend to shame men over being men. Just ditch them. 

16. If she wants flowers, give her lots of flowers. But if she doesn't know how to return the male version of the chivalry or flower thing, dump her: she's useless and just wants to receive, receive, receive. A woman's general well being and love for you is her responsibility, never yours. 

17. It's good to be kind, it's better to be very clear, even rude, then kind when you're right. There are people who aren't capable of hearing the truth, smile and ignore them. 

19. Choose your spouse carefully, protect your family. If you need to go against your mom's will when you're a grown man, it's her bad luck. It was her responsibility to grow up herself WHILE she raised you. If she didn't, it's still her responsibility, never yours. 

20. If any of your parents is WORTH giving a call, do it. If they nag and give you a hard time, it's not your job to raise them. Remember: This does include your mother. 

21. Recognize the 'victim mentality' types who subtly emasculate men, they're bloodsuckers! Beware of women who want to change men into woman-servants. Avoid at all times. 
A man is an autonomous being. A good woman prefers her man like that, she doesn't need an 'assemble-your-ideal-man' package.""

949,4.07E+07,"So I just read GLO's latest lifting post and this one bit inspired me to write this post:

>"" Most people have no idea how to fully contract their muscles via isolation exercises. Now if you go the Boston Loyd route and put 5cc horse syringes in your butt it doesn't matter. You can herp weights with no regard for muscular tension or form and still grow. If however you are natty, half natty, or YouTube natty, understanding how to properly contract your muscles is critical to your success.""


**Summary**: If standing in front of a mirror doing bicep curls/lat pull downs bores you to death, check out olympic weightlifting, aka the manliest sport on earth.


**Bodybuilding is good, but looks aren't everything**: If you're like me, you love lifting heavy shit once or twice, and then calling it a day (okay, sometimes I'll go HAM and rep out deadlifts, but it is very rare). GLO's advice of proper muscle contraction and the whole ""mind-muscle connection"" is, quite frankly, way too overblown in the fitness community, and contrary to what he says, is *not* critical to your success. Specific exercises contract specific muscles, and if you do those exercises enough, it will come to you  naturally. Now, good form is a must, but the real *critical* component to getting strong and jacked is to lift ***HEAVY***.

If you're a powerlifter, you can stop reading here and go back to reading about tinder sloots and affluenza-afflicted actresses on the main board.

If you're a newbie, or someone who's been doing bodybuilding with some emphasis on strength straining, please, carry on.

**DISCLAIMER**: Olympic weightlifting is arguably the most technically difficult sport on earth and having a good coach is very, very important.

***What is Olympic weightlifting?***: It's very simple. The entire sport consists of only 2 movements: 

[The snatch](https://youtu.be/0fM5R-pOcis?t=43)
and
[The clean and jerk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXqJN1PyD0E) aka the opposite of what you do before bed....
jerk and clean.....

Simple to watch, but performance....now that's a whole 'nother story. Athletes commonly spend 20+ years training in order to put up such unfathomable numbers. Day in day out grinding away at the barbell to add kilo after kilo to their total. Let me tell you something: 

There is nothing more masculine, more rewarding, more panty drenching, then putting 400+ lbs over your head. 

***Why you should do it***: 

**The mind**: Olympic lifting is brutal. It takes a massive toll on your body, as well as your mind. As someone who's played water polo and rugby, olympic lifting takes the cake when it comes to mental difficulty. Looking down at that bar loaded with fucking weight, thinking that you're about to drop under it...shit's intimidating. 
Of course, you're a fucking Red Pill man. You ain't gonna let some fucking weight scare you. You're gonna squat down, grab that shit, and catapult it overhead. And all that's going to do is benefit you. Olympic lifting teaches discipline, self control, it forces you to get the fuck over yourself when you feel broken. Bodybuilding does not do this. Powerlifting does it, but in a more boring way. If you want to become one with the iron and have the mental fortitude of a jacked and tan monk, do olympic lifting. 

**The body**: The key to massive hypertrophy and strength is picking up HEAVY shit and putting it back down. Not doing 20 reps of face pulls and super setting with chin ups. Those things will get you big in their respective sense, but nothing beats heavy compound lifts. (If you'd like to see a mix of both styles, check out George Leeman's youtube channel.) Olympic lifting is about the purest form of heavy compound lifting there is. The snatch and clean and jerk utilize your whole body (the least used muscle is the pecs). The primary movers are your legs, secondary being the core and shoulders. That's why olympic lifters look like

and [this](http://thehumancircus.hookgrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lu-xiaojun-squat-260.jpg)

(the 2nd picture is dimitri klokov, and the last two are lu xiaojun. both athletes perform accessory exercises such as dips, strict presses, a little bench press, GHD, and some formal bodybuilding training. A vast majority of their training is still snatch, clean and jerk, and variations of those two movements.) 

Keep in mind you will have large quads. I personally think that's great, some may not. 

The interesting thing about olympic lifting is, it doesn't necessarily have to make you big. Pure strength training is very nervous system dependent, that's why you see guys who aren't big in the bodybuilding sense putting up huge numbers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLNzd_FcThs these athletes performed very heavy lifts (90%+ of their max) daily, for a couple reps. They did not experience much hypertrophy, but their strength went up. That first guy, Ivan Ivanov, is lifting 175kg while probably weighing around **55kg**. That's some perspective for you. How do you feel about a manlet putting your max deadlift overhead?

Anyway. Fortunately for us high volume olympic lifts are great for hypertrophy. 

[Here](http://imgur.com/opKbnLz&vvh1vMm) is what 1.5 years of high volume olympic lifting and a tad bit of bodybuilding (~2 months active bb) has done for me. Note: I'm fat, and I naturally have bitch tits, yet you can still see the definition around my shoulders, abs, and legs. Imagine me with a lower bf%, and you can envision what high volume olympic lifting can do for your physique. Your results may be slower than mine, as I started at 18, but if you want to make hypertrophy faster, just throw in more bodybuilding (this can inhibit your snatching and clean and jerking ability, which I will now address).

**Training Methodology**: Olympic weightlifting training is generally very pure. If you really want, all you can do is snatch, clean and jerk, and squat. Most athletes do a variation of these movements throughout the week, and then test their maxes once or twice a month. Throwing in a lot of bodybuilding exercises can be detrimental to your snatch and clean and jerk progress due to the technicality of the two lifts. You really have to spend lots and lots of time doing them to get them down. Time spent doing bodybuilding could be time spent getting better at snatching and clean and jerking. It took me over a year to get my snatch to look like something that's decently respectable.

As an example, here's what one of my workouts might look like: 

muscle snatch 1x5 @ 50kg, 1x5 @ 60kg, 2x5 @ 65 kg, 3x4 @ 70kg

power clean 1x3 @ 80kg, 1x3 @ 100kg, 3x3 @110kg

push press 1x5 @ 70kg, 1x5 @ 80kg, 1x4 @ 90kg, 5x3 @100kg

back squat (we usually alternate back squats and front squats every workout) 1x5 @ 70kg, 1x5 @ 100kg, 1x4 @120kg, 1x4 @130kg, 1x4 @140kg, 1x3 @150kg, 4x3 @160kg, and then maybe work up to a heavy single at 180+kg. 

Here is a large collection of example weightlifting programs: http://www.catalystathletics.com/olympic-weightlifting-workouts/training-programs/

I started out olympic lifting in a commercial gym. All I really did was cleans, I had no idea how to snatch, nor did I want to because I didn't really have the option of dropping the weight. The proper environment is necessary. You need bumper plates in order to make progress on your lifts, dropping steel from overhead is a huge no-no. 

The biggest factor in making progress and staying injury free is having a good coach. In the US, coaching can be rather expensive. Look around, see what you can find, if you're a student, chances are you can get some kind of discount. Many weightlifting clubs have group workouts, where you can get feedback on your lifts while working out with a team (a great camaraderie forming activity). Seriously, these lifts are extremely technical, and you don't want to end up as some crossfit fag who does shit like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIw8sFREePw 

With that said, there is plenty of good youtube content which can help teach you the movements. [Heres](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2bcJFvW8nY) a good example. Be proactive, go check out a few weightlifting gyms if you're fortunate enough to have some in your area. Crossfit centers might also have dedicated weightlifting programs, but I'd stay away from doing crossfit itself if you want to be big and strong. 

Seriously, I have played over 10 sports and dabbled in bodybuilding and powerlifting and can say without a doubt olympic weightlifting is the most rewarding, exciting and masculine sport I have ever participated in. Don't let your age stop you from trying it out! [Vasily Alekseyev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasily_Alekseyev)  clean and jerked 256kg at 35 years old. 

Of course, as in any strength sport, steroids are a huge part of the lives of the elites. But that's a topic for another day. You absolutely do not have to take steroids to be a good weightlifter. 

If you love moving fast, putting heavy shit overhead, getting big, being the strongest person the in room, and getting back up when you're beat down (like any red pill man should) then I seriously recommend you give olympic weightlifting a try. Bodybuilding is great, but there's so much more to strength and lifting weights than dumbbell curls and cable fly's. Maybe one day you'll get to stand on the podium in front of thousands and bask in the glory that is [weightlifting](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eXsBvTSa7IQ/maxresdefault.jpg).

I'm going to argue something roughly analogous, for only for the office. If you work in an office, you work with women, and you have an HR department. Read in context appropriately. 


I have a shelf dedicated to third wave feminism. I especially like third-wave feminism and intersectionalism. Butler, Sedgwick, and Foucault are prominent. Trans-inclusive feminism writings, and musings about the problematic nature of Michfest's exclusionary policies. I've taken college level classes in gender studies, which I'm happy to talk about. Oh, and of course I work to make sure our office has annual guest speakers on racial inequality, LGBT rights in the workplace, and how to address the paygap between men and women practically in the workplace. 


Why? 


Think as you like but behave like others.  


Some of you are holding onto romantic notions that you can effect change. That the wheels haven't fully come off the cart. That we're not in some state of decline. No, no, and no. When you watch documentaries on climate change and the ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere you'll hear some of the smartest minds in science say that we're already past a tipping point, that when the warming affects are manifest decades from now, even if we stopped all CO2 emissions today, that Earth is going to become warm enough that enough species will perish that the few extant species won't be sustainable. That either we'll be living in some ecological hell with quality of life that wanes to today's standard, or that we'll succumb to the extinction event ourselves. You may believe that, or you may not. I don't know that I care. The analogy can be made to feminism; we're past the tipping point. Even if all the virulent tumblr-esque rhetoric were to cease, all the gender studies programs to suddenly be exposed for the farces they are, it'd be too late. We're already formative years into this next generation deeply indoctrinated by our feminized culture afraid of and persecuting boys for existing as some necessary evil. These children will become adults, and their formative years have already been spent in public schools with single mothers. A decade from now it'll still be more toxic than it is now, no matter what you do in the interim. 


And even if you don't believe that, it doesn't matter. TRP is about accepting what is. Men's Rights, or any other advocacy organization, is about creating change. We're not changing anything but ourselves. We're accepting the world for what it is and acting accordingly. Your job isn't reversing the denigration of society, it's carving out your own little Eden insulated from the social justice equivalent of ecological demise. 


So make yourself immune from criticism from social justice or complaint from the left more generally. Purporting to believe as others do, and espousing their views even more aggressively than they do, is the key to my workplace success. If anyone hears something they don't like, I attack them from the left. Don't like that my division is making inroads on your clients? It's probably because we have a culture of diversity, I can't believe how many members of your management team are white women; why aren't you hiring more diverse candidates? Think that I'm being overly aggressive? It's probably because I'm so passionate about demolishing existing power structures and creating an office-wide meritocracy where we credit our success to inclusion and pay it back by organizing division-wide volunteering events at women's organizations. 


Oh, and talk like them, and use their words. 


Three women six months ago were upset with me. They called one of my programs idiotic. I emailed them a link on problematic ableist language and gave a heads up to HR. HR loves me. 


Am I speeding the demise? Probably. I'm the equivalent of China in my office, I'm putting up a new coal power plant every week. I don't care. Everything's coming up roses. Not only do I have more authority, making more money, I have an ace in my pocket above reproach, and it's called feminism.

If we look at the statistics, single mothers are worse parents than single fathers. Women practice more favoritism with their children, spank more often and at younger ages, make poorer economic decisions and a whole host of other issues. I've heard that women are supposed to be the more caring of the two sexes, but the single most important factor for predicting the development of empathy in a child is a FATHER in the home, not a mother. 


Women are more likely to divorce for money, sleep around more often, feel less remorse, and prop up a bunch of the dumb feminist movements. After women were given the right to vote, the government tilted heavily to social programs and left leaning doctrines, almost single handedly creating the dependency/handout system and putting the country in debt.

The sex was particularly rough, full of energy, and we couldn't get enough of it.

955,316mfk,"Hey guys,
First I want to say, I'm not trying to evangelize or impose my religion on anyone. I just want to share a testimonial.

I used to be a pretty hardcore atheist. I studied engineering and was a ""science is my religion"" kind of guy, rejecting all kind of religious/metaphysic thoughts and theories.

My parents are Catholics although I'm not sure they believe in it, and we never discussed the topic of God (I'm European by the way).

Then some years ago, the more I was understanding the world around me, the more I understood the the importance of concepts such as Truth, Beauty, Good. I started reading philosophers (the Stoics really had a big impact on me, especially Seneca), and I gradually got interested in what the Christ message was. I started reading the Gospels, and for the first time all this ""religious bullshit"" actually made a lot of sense to me.

In parallel I started swallowing the different red pill(s), and it totally confirmed by belief in Christianity.

The way I see it, we've been totally robbed of everything that makes a society strong: our religion, our nation, our value of family, our respect of elders, our balance of male/female roles. We're totally naked and without any substance anymore.

We all understand on this sub that men need to get back something that has been lost, we're not too sure what it is precisely but it's something. To me, the missing piece is spiritual and it's been in front of my eyes the whole time.

And wether Christ is the truth or not, there's nothing more powerful than a bunch of men united by a common religious faith - for better or worst. If you want to break your enemy, destroy his religion and the rest will follow.

Any way, I'm in the process of getting baptized. That's something I never thought would be possible, and yet here I am. I'm wondering if anyone is following a similar path.",955,4.0,0.4699999988079071,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
956,3ixb2d,"I've seen a few guys complaining about a lack of game posts.  Here's a game post.

For two years I've been trying out some variation of the ""girls are dumb"" neg. I've recently had some success with a modified version of this.

Last year I tried this out on a plate, massage therapist plate, when I just up and told her she was dumb. This was not the most successful use of the ""girls are dumb"" neg but it lead me to yesterday's successful deployment.  So here's this story.

Last year my massage therapist plate and I were hanging out and drinking and she was trying to use me as her fucking beta cry pillow boy over some other alpha who pumped and dumped her. She's all sad, so I ask her what's up?  She tells me some vague story about some ""guy"", who was not one of her regular stable of beta orbiters, who she waited for outside of his work for three hours.  And he stood her up.

She dropped a tell by telling me that he's ""troubled"" and his ex is a ""real bitch"", to let me know that she wants his dick. And that she was all dressed up uncomfortable and waited in the hot sun, in her car, for three hours for this guy.  He went out with a different girl and he didn't even text her.  She's all mad and sad, telling me how upset she is because she texted him five times.

At this point this fucking plate was seriously testing my frame. Massive shit test telling me about her other alpha fucks.  I did not agree to spend time with this plate so that she could sob about getting pumped and dumped to me. That's her betas job.  And this bitch came over in pajamas wanting to fucking watch Pretty Little Liars with me. And she brought snacks.

So I just went nuclear on her. I told her that girls are often much dumber then they think. Because guys will always tell them how smart they are to get into their panties. And I reminded her that she failed the state massage therapist exam four times and I've got a degree from a fancy liberal brainwashing center.  And I straight told her that she's dumb and she needs to listen to me do what I tell her to do.  I told her she was going to end up being one of those sluts that gets an abortion.

I was using amused mastery and established high levels of pre selection and abusing the ""you're like my little sister"" game to go nuclear and straight tell her that she's stupid and needs to be led by a man like me.

Then I derailed that into her talking about how she's on birth control and I made sure she knew I had condoms.  When I fucked her she was quite submissive. But that was the night she told me ""I love you"" after sex.  And guys one thing I've learned is that once they drop the L-bomb on you their spinning orbit is going to expand until they spin into another man's pull.  Spin away plate.

Yesterday I went out with a potential mini-LTR.  Maybe even more.  I'm sick of soft harems so I'm looking for a girl I can spend maybe five years with. Maybe even more. Girl is 19 and prime and (likely) has not gone carouselling yet.  She still lives with her dad and hasn't started her college ride.  Been nineteen for two months.  We were texting.

I've been dropping pre selection into our conversations by occasionally mentioning my ""ex girlfriends"".  Any plate can become an ""ex"" in any conversation where it's useful to you. Especially if there are old pictures of you two together out on Facebook or something.

And I've already let this potential know that my last ex had bigger tits and a better ass then Starbuck's did.

She gets this;

""Well the last girl I was dating, *massage therapist*, was kind of stupid. I mean that's not some kind of moral judgement on my part. It's just that it was true. She had lots of other good things about her. She was very nice. And fun to hang out with. And she was a massage therapist and gave me free massages. Which are awesome by the way.  Plus her hair was long and she was cute.""

'Why did you think she was dumb?  Oy my dad always told me that guys will tell me anything to get into my pants.  (My pet parrot) just scared my dad. He's such a chicken!  :) :)'

""I mean she was just kind of dumb. One day I told her that she needed to stop making decisions without talking to me.  I forget how I worded it but I don't think I was mean. Maybe I was. I just let her know that she's not really very smart, but that's ok, and I liked her anyway.  And that there are lots of other good things about her.""

And I sent a second text before she could respond.

""I figured it would be good for her to know that she's not very smart because she always thought she was just so smart. And because of this she kept making bad decisions. Especially with money.

But her mom was always bailing her out.  And she was always going to her mom and having her mom buy us stuff. Even concert tickets once.""

And again I texted her before she could respond.

""She got so mad. I thought it was kind of funny but she was actually mad!  And she told me about all these other people, guys clearly, who had told her all about how smart (and funny) she was and is. I had to tell her that guys will lie to you if you are a girl and tell you all kinds of lies. To get into your panties.""

I don't typically send multiple messages so this broke our normal pattern of texts. She responded like so;

""Hey sometimes being dumb but really pretty gets you places lol. I personally hate that way. I am quite the opposite. I mean not because I'm not thin just I have bad genetics. With my large nose, big green eyes, and medium length black hair, with freckles.  Did you know I'm naturally a red head?  REAL red.  I'm a ginger. That's horrible! Some girls are real sluts, and some guys want nothing but a girls pants, which gets me really really angry.""

Conversation went fine with Starbucks.  And today I get this.  Have not texted her since last night and I now leave it to her to engage the chase, much to her delight.  She sends this;

""My favorite book is Fahrenheit 451.  I got an A on my AP English exam that I wrote on that very book.  My old English teacher Mrs. Snow even asked what I thought about that book.  So I really analyzed it. What's your favorite book *kill_your_ego*?""

So now she knows that she's got smaller tits then my pre-selection can pull, that I'll call a girl dumb to her face even with them tits.  Pics of us together on Facebook with massage therapist's tits out is +50 pre-selection bonus. And I'm sure this girl has looked.  And now she wants to qualify herself to me as not a dumb slut.

This girl is hard Christian so at some point in the future I'm going to bring up this old thread I've found (saved) on a Christian forum about what constitutes sex.  The consensus is that her sucking my dick isn't sex.  And it's iffy for her to let me go up her butt. But we can argue about it and hey why not try it out?

Gonna introduce that with more pre-selection.  I've established my n-number as 5 with Starbucks. By using hamster math and only counting my LTRs.  I think my 20+ number would make her think I'm a player or one of those evil PUAs or something.

But I can feed her hamster with *is this guy a player?*, and, *can my pussy lock him down?*, by so sincerely and honestly trying to figure out if my actual n-number is 5.  Cause it doesn't count when a girl sucks my dick right Starbucks?

What do you think girl?  Is it sex if she swallows my cum?

957,6uo048," It was a strange night. I was in a strange mood. A female friend of mine had invited me out to party, but her friends were less than enjoyable.

I pulled away from the group and was going to go home, as I'd rather be alone than with shitty company, but a good friend of mine showed up and reminded me what good company is.

We left the bar and headed into town. We danced like fools at a dope club.

While dancing, a sexy brunette approached me and told me how much she loves my long hair. Not a few seconds later, her jealous friend came over and pulled her away. She stared at me as she left.

We hopped to a few other bars but I got bored, so we started walking home.

As we pass the last of the bars on the street, I see a cute brunette looking at me from her table. We lock eyes, I smile, and I keep walking.

She says something to me in Romanian. I stop and turn back to her. 

""Sorry, what? I don't speak Romanian.""

She smiles and says to me, ""I love your hair"" and reaches out. I step to her and let her feel my hair. I meet her and her cute blonde friend who ends up being her cousin. My buddy comes over and meets them.

After a few minutes of talking he moves to the table next to us and stays on his phone to avoid any awkward moments with the cousin who isn't into him. Amazing wingman. 

She's sitting on the chair while I'm crouched next to her, but my knees star to hurt. I tell her to stand up. She does, I take her seat, and then pull her onto my lap.

""Good girl. Sit in papi's lap.""

She smiles and asks me if I'm her papi. I tell her yes. I bring up sex and she tells me she's a virgin. I tell her that I'm going to be the one to take her virginity. She begs to differ.

She's 19 and been going out since she was 16. Given the empirical evidence (I have more evidence than her), these girls seem to be a bit more conservative than their Western counterparts, on average. 

I ask her why she's never had sex and she tells me she's never found anyone who was worth giving it to.

I tell her again that I'm going to be her first. She teases me again.I grab her face and kiss her. Her cousin is smiling. 

I push VERY hard to bring her home, but to no avail. Perhaps twenty or thirty minutes pass and I decide it's not going anywhere. She doesn't want to get pulled in front of her cousin.

I grab her number and text her.

Silly bitch.

She comes over a few hours later. 

It takes me about 10 minutes to take her virginity. She even hands me the frame. She tells me how her cousin and her friends told her not to come over, and then when she was adamant, they told her not to do anything with me. I asked her if she's going to spend her whole life listening to what other people say she should do.

She gets quiet.

GG.

I take her clothes off and she asks me to be gentle, since she's new.

I am gentle....at first. I also confirm the virginity. Lots of blood. 

Our second round, I put this bitch's knees on her chest and piledrive her. It hurts her, but she enjoys it. She stares at my cock as it drives into her and I ask if she likes watching papi stretch her virgin pussy open. She tells me yes. 

I fuck her like four times. 

The next time I text her, I ask her to come over and she gives me shit about only wanting sex from her. I tell her that I like spending time with her. She continues to give me shit so I ignore her.

The next morning she texts me, ""Hi papi! :)""

Totally new attitude. We have a brief conversation, then I wait a day and text her ""hey baby.""

She comes over that night and we fuck again. This time, while hanging out, I tell her that her cousin is hot and that we should have a threesome. She gets mad.  

A few days later, she sends me a picture of her and her cousin licking ice cream. It's beyond suggestive. I give her some devil emojis and then ignore her next texts, because I felt like being an asshole for some reason. 

The next day, she sends me this

Her - You really see just the slut in me, don't you?

Her - Well, I AM NOT YOUR FUCKING SLUT!

I try to calm her down but she keeps acting up.

Me - Look, if you want to believe what you're thinking is true, then go ahead. It obviously doesn't matter what I say. I told you that I like you and enjoy spending time with you. I Also told you I can't promise anything more than that. I've been 100% honest from the start so I have nothing to justify and I don't have to defend myself. So if you don't want to see me anymore, then thats fine but don't accuse me or insinuate that I'm a bad person by giving me this attitude. I did nothing wrong.

___________________________________________

She apologizes and tells me that she thought she could handle a casual, sexual relationship but has feelings for me. I understand. I was her first.  

We end things on a high note.

A few months later, I randomly hit her up and she comes over that night. We fuck (and on one more occasion after that, before she leaves the country for an internship). 

She tells me how she still hasn't slept with anyone else. Maybe it's a lie. Maybe it's not.

Doesn't matter. 

I ask her why she hasn't fucked anyone else and she says all the other guys are boring. I ask her why she's with me then if she knows I won't date her (she's nice, cute, and fun to fuck, but I have other things in mind.)

959,4t1dcx,"**EDIT:** /u/Archwinger summed it up better than I did: *""So I can see how the MGTOW weirdos might get confused and think that The Red Pill is primarily some kind of man-improvement ideology that's separate from getting laid. But really, it's about getting laid. If you're not here to learn more effective ways to get laid, you don't belong at The Red Pill.""*

**SUMMARY:** The Red Pill sub-reddit has grown by more than 60,000 members in the last year.  Unfortunately, *some of you still don’t get it,* and **seem to think we're some kind of edgy Men's Health 2.0**.  Bring on the downvotes.

Why does the Red Pill exist?  **TRP exists to create a forum for “discussion of sexual strategy in a culture increasingly lacking a positive identity for men.”**  That’s it.  That is the basis of this sub-reddit, the basis of our ideology, the source of our philosophies.  **Sexual.  Strategy.**

The pursuit of that overall sexual strategy offer many tactical options, all geared around the singular purpose of increasing SMV (sexual market value) in order to gain access to the higher quality sexual partners typically reserved for the top 10 percent of men, the natural “alphas.”  **Bodybuilding, nutrition, reading books, Monk Mode as a whole, these are all tools, tactics for to facilitate the process of increasing SMV.** 

* > TRP isn’t all about girls.

* > Pussy isn’t the objective.

* > The main goal should be improvement and acceptance of yourself.

* > Why are you so focused on sex?

**All three of the paraphrased statements,** part of a message I’m seeing more and more frequently on this sub, **represent a fundamental misunderstand of the objective of the Red Pill.**

**Monk Mode is not the end-game.**  We are not MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way).  We do not seek to remove ourselves from the Matrix and live in a dark, harsh desert of the real; we seek to to take manipulate it, take advantage of it, and in the process, do epic shit others cannot and live satisfying lives.  We don’t seek to end the hunt, to retreat like some kind of ascetic hermit to ponder existential enlightenment as voluntary incels.  Rather, we want to dominate the hunt and thrive in its process.

**TRP is the Art of War for men in the sexual marketplace.**  It encourages to know our “enemy” and to better understand her as well as ourselves so that when we meet, we will emerge from the confrontation victorious and successful on our own terms.  **But just as Sun Tzu was not a pacifist seeking to end all wars, we are not seeking to “change” women or alter the rules of the game.**  We leave that fool’s errand to MRAs and others of the like.  Ultimately, we just want to capitalize on all that slutty pussy they’re leaving on the table.

What about **outcome independence** and **IDGAF?**  Aren’t you not supposed to put the pussy on the pedestal?  Absolutely, and this is where MGTOW loses the fucking plot.  There is a strong distinction between becoming obsessed with a single woman (“one-itis”), not realizing that she’s exactly like the billions of others on the planet, and deciding to forsake the pursuit of women all together.  

**Outcome independence is internalizing your value, and knowing when to simply say, “Next,” and move on to another woman, not giving a fuck about the opportunity loss inherent to that decision (destroying the Myth of the Unicorn).**  But inherent in that process is *going on to the next woman, always gaming, pursuing, closing.*  IDGAF is about being willing to walk away, because the person willing to leave holds the power, and power, as TRP teaches us, is an effective aphrodisiac.  

By all means, minimize low-value activities like Netflix and addictive video games.  Continue your real education by reading quality books, expanding your base of knowledge and intellect.  Develop interesting hobbies and strive for professional achievements.  Lift heavy shit and achieve a healthy body fat percentage.  Live minimally because it allows you to focus on what’s important.  Find solace in the process because it is hard, but do not miss the forest for the trees: Becoming the best version of yourself is valuable struggle that builds strong character and social proof, and by-product of social proof is sex.

“How is that any different from PUA or seduction then?” you might ask.  The difference is PUAs rely on playbooks, gimmicks, and general bullshit to try and convince women to sleep with them.  We want to you build yourself into the man that women naturally want to fuck, to transcend that PUA shit by dominating your social environment.

But make no mistake: **The objective of TRP is to give men the tools for successful sexual conquest.**  Statements like, *”I truly believe that The Red Pill isn't only about the girls,”* just indicate you don’t understand why we’re here.  You may choose to voluntarily forego the dating game, to pursue some kind of solitary enlightenment.  But that choice is yours, and yours alone.  **That does not make it TRP, and it does not change the fact that TRP is built around the principle of fucking beautiful women.**

**CONCLUSION:** 

* You are free to establish your own priorities in life, but that doesn’t make them TRP’s.

* Stop trying to reinterpret TRP and conform it to your belief system; take that shit elsewhere.

* Crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.

960,6sbx6i,"As reported in Bloomberg, Google has fired a senior software engineer, James Damore, for authoring a 10-page memo (pasted below) condemning the company’s diversity efforts and claiming men are biologically more predisposed to working in the tech industry than women.  According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr. Damore has a masters degree in systems biology from Harvard. (correction: the original posted stated he had a Ph.D, this has since been corrected after Damore updated his LinkedIn profile)

A full reading of the memo shows that Mr. Damore was making a fair and well-reasoned argument for why pay gap and hiring gap issues could not be solely attributable to gender bias against women, and that to understand the full picture, Google (governments and institutions included) need to also consider biological, psychological, social and cultural factors which explain the differences between the genders.  Men and Women are actually different, right?

Apparently, this speech violated Google's ""code of conduct"".   The CEO fired Mr. Damore for sexist stereotypes. However, I would ague that Mr. Damore's memo was not ""sexist"" but rather very logical and scientific.  It simply did not sit well with the prevailing cultural elites at the company who believe there is no room for debating authoritarian policies which seek to use artificial quotas and policies to correct for alleged discrimination. However, there is no data to support the fact that the discrepancies between representation of women in science and tech industries has anything to do with other than chosen educations and vocational preferences.

Nice work Google.  Before you retaliate against your employees for exercising political speech, perhaps you should give room for other points of view which are actually supported by scientific data.

The memo:

Background [1]

People generally have good intentions, but we all have biases which are invisible to us. Thankfully, open and honest discussion with those who disagree can highlight our blind spots and help us grow, which is why I wrote this document.[2] Google has several biases and honest discussion about these biases is being silenced by the dominant ideology. What follows is by no means the complete story, but it’s a perspective that desperately needs to be told at Google.

Google’s biases

At Google, we talk so much about unconscious bias as it applies to race and gender, but we rarely discuss our moral biases. Political orientation is actually a result of deep moral preferences and thus biases. Considering that the overwhelming majority of the social sciences, media, and Google lean left, we should critically examine these prejudices.

Left Biases

Compassion for the weak
Disparities are due to injustices
Humans are inherently cooperative
Change is good (unstable)
Open
Idealist
Right Biases

Respect for the strong/authority
Disparities are natural and just
Humans are inherently competitive
Change is dangerous (stable)
Closed
Pragmatic
Neither side is 100% correct and both viewpoints are necessary for a functioning society or, in this case, company. A company too far to the right may be slow to react, overly hierarchical, and untrusting of others. In contrast, a company too far to the left will constantly be changing (deprecating much loved services), over diversify its interests (ignoring or being ashamed of its core business), and overly trust its employees and competitors.

Only facts and reason can shed light on these biases, but when it comes to diversity and inclusion, Google’s left bias has created a politically correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence. This silence removes any checks against encroaching extremist and authoritarian policies. For the rest of this document, I’ll concentrate on the extreme stance that all differences in outcome are due to differential treatment and the authoritarian element that’s required to actually discriminate to create equal representation.

Possible non-bias causes of the gender gap in tech [3]

At Google, we’re regularly told that implicit (unconscious) and explicit biases are holding women back in tech and leadership. Of course, men and women experience bias, tech, and the workplace differently and we should be cognizant of this, but it’s far from the whole story.

On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. These differences aren’t just socially constructed because:

They’re universal across human cultures
They often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone
Biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often still identify and act like males
The underlying traits are highly heritable
They’re exactly what we would predict from an evolutionary psychology perspective
Note, I’m not saying that all men differ from women in the following ways or that these differences are “just.” I’m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. Many of these differences are small and there’s significant overlap between men and women, so you can’t say anything about an individual given these population level distributions.

Personality differences

Women, on average, have more:

Openness directed towards feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas. Women generally also have a stronger interest in people rather than things, relative to men (also interpreted as empathizing vs. systemizing).
These two differences in part explain why women relatively prefer jobs in social or artistic areas. More men may like coding because it requires systemizing and even within SWEs, comparatively more women work on front end, which deals with both people and aesthetics.
Extraversion expressed as gregariousness rather than assertiveness. Also, higher agreeableness.
This leads to women generally having a harder time negotiating salary, asking for raises, speaking up, and leading. Note that these are just average differences and there’s overlap between men and women, but this is seen solely as a women’s issue. This leads to exclusory programs like Stretch and swaths of men without support.
Neuroticism (higher anxiety, lower stress tolerance).This may contribute to the higher levels of anxiety women report on Googlegeist and to the lower number of women in high stress jobs.
Note that contrary to what a social constructionist would argue, research suggests that “greater nation-level gender equality leads to psychological dissimilarity in men’s and women’s personality traits.” Because as “society becomes more prosperous and more egalitarian, innate dispositional differences between men and women have more space to develop and the gap that exists between men and women in their personality becomes wider.” We need to stop assuming that gender gaps imply sexism.

Men’s higher drive for status

We always ask why we don’t see women in top leadership positions, but we never ask why we see so many men in these jobs. These positions often require long, stressful hours that may not be worth it if you want a balanced and fulfilling life.

Status is the primary metric that men are judged on[4], pushing many men into these higher paying, less satisfying jobs for the status that they entail. Note, the same forces that lead men into high pay/high stress jobs in tech and leadership cause men to take undesirable and dangerous jobs like coal mining, garbage collection, and firefighting, and suffer 93% of work-related deaths.

Non-discriminatory ways to reduce the gender gap

Below I’ll go over some of the differences in distribution of traits between men and women that I outlined in the previous section and suggest ways to address them to increase women’s representation in tech and without resorting to discrimination. Google is already making strides in many of these areas, but I think it’s still instructive to list them:

Women on average show a higher interest in people and men in things
We can make software engineering more people-oriented with pair programming and more collaboration. Unfortunately, there may be limits to how people-oriented certain roles and Google can be and we shouldn’t deceive ourselves or students into thinking otherwise (some of our programs to get female students into coding might be doing this).
Women on average are more cooperative
Allow those exhibiting cooperative behavior to thrive. Recent updates to Perf may be doing this to an extent, but maybe there’s more we can do. This doesn’t mean that we should remove all competitiveness from Google. Competitiveness and self reliance can be valuable traits and we shouldn’t necessarily disadvantage those that have them, like what’s been done in education. Women on average are more prone to anxiety. Make tech and leadership less stressful. Google already partly does this with its many stress reduction courses and benefits.
Women on average look for more work-life balance while men have a higher drive for status on average
Unfortunately, as long as tech and leadership remain high status, lucrative careers, men may disproportionately want to be in them. Allowing and truly endorsing (as part of our culture) part time work though can keep more women in tech.
The male gender role is currently inflexible
Feminism has made great progress in freeing women from the female gender role, but men are still very much tied to the male gender role. If we, as a society, allow men to be more “feminine,” then the gender gap will shrink, although probably because men will leave tech and leadership for traditionally feminine roles.
Philosophically, I don’t think we should do arbitrary social engineering of tech just to make it appealing to equal portions of both men and women. For each of these changes, we need principles reasons for why it helps Google; that is, we should be optimizing for Google—with Google’s diversity being a component of that. For example currently those trying to work extra hours or take extra stress will inevitably get ahead and if we try to change that too much, it may have disastrous consequences. Also, when considering the costs and benefits, we should keep in mind that Google’s funding is finite so its allocation is more zero-sum than is generally acknowledged.

The Harm of Google’s biases

I strongly believe in gender and racial diversity, and I think we should strive for more. However, to achieve a more equal gender and race representation, Google has created several discriminatory practices:

Programs, mentoring, and classes only for people with a certain gender or race [5]
A high priority queue and special treatment for “diversity” candidates
Hiring practices which can effectively lower the bar for “diversity” candidates by decreasing the false negative rate
Reconsidering any set of people if it’s not “diverse” enough, but not showing that same scrutiny in the reverse direction (clear confirmation bias)
Setting org level OKRs for increased representation which can incentivize illegal discrimination [6]
These practices are based on false assumptions generated by our biases and can actually increase race and gender tensions. We’re told by senior leadership that what we’re doing is both the morally and economically correct thing to do, but without evidence this is just veiled left ideology[7] that can irreparably harm Google.

Why we’re blind

We all have biases and use motivated reasoning to dismiss ideas that run counter to our internal values. Just as some on the Right deny science that runs counter to the “God > humans > environment” hierarchy (e.g., evolution and climate change) the Left tends to deny science concerning biological differences between people (e.g., IQ[8] and sex differences). Thankfully, climate scientists and evolutionary biologists generally aren’t on the right. Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of humanities and social scientists learn left (about 95%), which creates enormous confirmation bias, changes what’s being studied, and maintains myths like social constructionism and the gender wage gap[9]. Google’s left leaning makes us blind to this bias and uncritical of its results, which we’re using to justify highly politicized programs.

In addition to the Left’s affinity for those it sees as weak, humans are generally biased towards protecting females. As mentioned before, this likely evolved because males are biologically disposable and because women are generally more cooperative and areeable than men. We have extensive government and Google programs, fields of study, and legal and social norms to protect women, but when a man complains about a gender issue issue [sic] affecting men, he’s labelled as a misogynist and whiner[10]. Nearly every difference between men and women is interpreted as a form of women’s oppression. As with many things in life, gender differences are often a case of “grass being greener on the other side”; unfortunately, taxpayer and Google money is spent to water only one side of the lawn.

The same compassion for those seen as weak creates political correctness[11], which constrains discourse and is complacent to the extremely sensitive PC-authoritarians that use violence and shaming to advance their cause. While Google hasn’t harbored the violent leftists protests that we’re seeing at universities, the frequent shaming in TGIF and in our culture has created the same silence, psychologically unsafe environment.

Suggestions

I hope it’s clear that I’m not saying that diversity is bad, that Google or society is 100% fair, that we shouldn’t try to correct for existing biases, or that minorities have the same experience of those in the majority. My larger point is that we have an intolerance for ideas and evidence that don’t fit a certain ideology. I’m also not saying that we should restrict people to certain gender roles; I’m advocating for quite the opposite: treat people as individuals, not as just another member of their group (tribalism).

My concrete suggestions are to:

De-moralize diversity.

As soon as we start to moralize an issue, we stop thinking about it in terms of costs and benefits, dismiss anyone that disagrees as immoral, and harshly punish those we see as villains to protect the “victims.”
Stop alienating conservatives.

Viewpoint diversity is arguably the most important type of diversity and political orientation is one of the most fundamental and significant ways in which people view things differently.
In highly progressive environments, conservatives are a minority that feel like they need to stay in the closet to avoid open hostility. We should empower those with different ideologies to be able to express themselves.
Alienating conservatives is both non-inclusive and generally bad business because conservatives tend to be higher in conscientiousness, which is require for much of the drudgery and maintenance work characteristic of a mature company.
Confront Google’s biases.

I’ve mostly concentrated on how our biases cloud our thinking about diversity and inclusion, but our moral biases are farther reaching than that.
I would start by breaking down Googlegeist scores by political orientation and personality to give a fuller picture into how our biases are affecting our culture.
Stop restricting programs and classes to certain genders or races.

These discriminatory practices are both unfair and divisive. Instead focus on some of the non-discriminatory practices I outlined.
Have an open and honest discussion about the costs and benefits of our diversity programs.

Discriminating just to increase the representation of women in tech is as misguided and biased as mandating increases for women’s representation in the homeless, work-related and violent deaths, prisons, and school dropouts.
There’s currently very little transparency into the extend of our diversity programs which keeps it immune to criticism from those outside its ideological echo chamber.
These programs are highly politicized which further alienates non-progressives.
I realize that some of our programs may be precautions against government accusations of discrimination, but that can easily backfire since they incentivize illegal discrimination.
Focus on psychological safety, not just race/gender diversity.

We should focus on psychological safety, which has shown positive effects and should (hopefully) not lead to unfair discrimination.
We need psychological safety and shared values to gain the benefits of diversity
Having representative viewpoints is important for those designing and testing our products, but the benefits are less clear for those more removed from UX.
De-emphasize empathy.

I’ve heard several calls for increased empathy on diversity issues. While I strongly support trying to understand how and why people think the way they do, relying on affective empathy—feeling another’s pain—causes us to focus on anecdotes, favor individuals similar to us, and harbor other irrational and dangerous biases. Being emotionally unengaged helps us better reason about the facts.
Prioritize intention.

Our focus on microaggressions and other unintentional transgressions increases our sensitivity, which is not universally positive: sensitivity increases both our tendency to take offense and our self censorship, leading to authoritarian policies. Speaking up without the fear of being harshly judged is central to psychological safety, but these practices can remove that safety by judging unintentional transgressions.
Microaggression training incorrectly and dangerously equates speech with violence and isn’t backed by evidence.
Be open about the science of human nature.

Once we acknowledge that not all differences are socially constructed or due to discrimination, we open our eyes to a more accurate view of the human condition which is necessary if we actually want to solve problems.
Reconsider making Unconscious Bias training mandatory for promo committees.

We haven’t been able to measure any effect of our Unconscious Bias training and it has the potential for overcorrecting or backlash, especially if made mandatory.
Some of the suggested methods of the current training (v2.3) are likely useful, but the political bias of the presentation is clear from the factual inaccuracies and the examples shown.
Spend more time on the many other types of biases besides stereotypes. Stereotypes are much more accurate and responsive to new information than the training suggests (I’m not advocating for using stereotypes, I [sic] just pointing out the factual inaccuracy of what’s said in the training).
[1] This document is mostly written from the perspective of Google’s Mountain View campus, I can’t speak about other offices or countries.

[2] Of course, I may be biased and only see evidence that supports my viewpoint. In terms of political biases, I consider myself a classical liberal and strongly value individualism and reason. I’d be very happy to discuss any of the document further and provide more citations.

[3] Throughout the document, by “tech”, I mostly mean software engineering.

[4] For heterosexual romantic relationships, men are more strongly judged by status and women by beauty. Again, this has biological origins and is culturally universal.

[5] Stretch, BOLD, CSSI, Engineering Practicum (to an extent), and several other Google funded internal and external programs are for people with a certain gender or race.

 
[6] Instead set Googlegeist OKRs, potentially for certain demographics. We can increase representation at an org level by either making it a better environment for certain groups (which would be seen in survey scores) or discriminating based on a protected status (which is illegal and I’ve seen it done). Increased representation OKRs can incentivize the latter and create zero-sum struggles between orgs.

[7] Communism promised to be both morally and economically superior to capitalism, but every attempt became morally corrupt and an economic failure. As it became clear that the working class of the liberal democracies wasn’t going to overthrow their “capitalist oppressors,” the Marxist intellectuals transitioned from class warfare to gender and race politics. The core oppressor-oppressed dynamics remained, but now the oppressor is the “white, straight, cis-gendered patriarchy.”

[8] Ironically, IQ tests were initially championed by the Left when meritocracy meant helping the victims of the aristocracy.

[9] Yes, in a national aggregate, women have lower salaries than men for a variety of reasons. For the same work though, women get paid just as much as men. Considering women spend more money than men and that salary represents how much the employees sacrifices (e.g. more hours, stress, and danger), we really need to rethink our stereotypes around power.

[10] “The traditionalist system of gender does not deal well with the idea of men needing support. Men are expected to be strong, to not complain, and to deal with problems on their own. Men’s problems are more often seen as personal failings rather than victimhood,, due to our gendered idea of agency. This discourages men from bringing attention to their issues (whether individual or group-wide issues), for fear of being seen as whiners, complainers, or weak.”

[11] Political correctness is defined as “the avoidance of forms of expression or action that are perceived to exclude, marginalize, or insult groups of people who are socially disadvantaged or discriminated against,” which makes it clear why it’s a phenomenon of the Left and a tool of authoritarians.",960,4.0,0.32589998841285706,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
961,5fihmu,"**A complete guide to picking up 9s and 10s**  
Today I want to tell you everything I know about getting the highest calibre girls from cold approach.  
This guide will cover: frame control, inner game, and passing tests — which I consider to be the holy trinity of “9 and 10 game”.  
This guide will NOT cover: body language, pulling, or handling logistics. Obviously, the latter are extremely important, but they’ve been adequately covered elsewhere, and there just isn’t space to include them here.  


&nbsp;


**My background**  
Picked on in school, small and sickly, didn’t have a girlfriend until 18. Was dumped by her and spent the first 2 years of college pretty much celibate.  
Got into redpill ideas through the old “Citizen Renegade” blog (which is now Heartiste). From there stumbled on RSD’s infield videos.  
Started going out and approaching regularly. Approach anxiety and ceaseless rejection for months, but I kept at it. The odd success here and there.  
After about 2 years I was fucking a new girl every fortnight or so, mostly 7s and 8s with the occasional turbo when fortune smiled on me. My current girlfriend is a 9, has done modelling etc.  


&nbsp;


**Below is everything I know about getting the hottest women from cold approach pickup.**
This is specially engineered for getting 9s and 10s and dealing with the kind of bullshit these girls will inevitably give you.  
If you’re more into sleeping with tons of 7s (and there’s nothing wrong with that), this might be overkill.  
When I was single I personally was one of those guys who would rather fuck half a dozen 9s/10s in a year than 50 mid range girls, so my whole approach to game is based on optimizing for that.  
Take it for what it is — I’m not saying my approach is better, this is just how I roll based on my preferences.  
This is a long post. You may want to bookmark it and return to it later if you’re particularly concerned with getting the hottest girls.   There’s a lot of subtle points in here that won’t be immediately clear on a first reading.  


&nbsp;


---------


&nbsp;


**PART 1: THE ATTRACTION PROCESS**  


&nbsp;


**1\. Women are attracted to you because you have a stronger frame than they do.**  
That’s all.  
There’s nothing else to it.  
Attraction is purely a function of the fact that:  
1\. you’re a man  
2\. you have a *stronger frame* than the girl  
As a man, you naturally have a strong frame of reality whereas women don’t. Therefore they value that. (Having a strong frame is a result of high testosterone levels.)  


&nbsp;


**2\. Women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame than a handsome guy with a weak one**  
Evolution has designed women to be very flexible in terms of who they’ll become attracted to.  
Women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame (i.e. a natural leader) than a handsome guy with a weak frame (cowardice, uncertainty).  
That’s because women who chose to fuck the latter ultimately had their genes rooted out of existence by the brutal conditions of ancestral life.  
In consequence, women now are very adaptable. They have the capacity to be attracted to almost ANY man so long as his frame is stronger than hers.  


&nbsp;


**3\. A girl can ONLY get horny for you if you have a stronger frame than her.**  
Think of this like a mathematical equation. There’s no getting around it, no cheating it, no short-circuiting it. It is an immutable law.  
Women want to submit to you. They want to submit to a strong man. But she can’t submit to you if your frame is weaker than hers.  
Physiologically, girls can’t even become wet for a guy who has a weaker frame than they do. It’s literally impossible.  


&nbsp;


**4\. “Be a man. Act like you have answers.” (Bill Burr)**  
What is a strong frame? Fundamentally, it’s a sense of certainty in everything you do. This certainty manifests itself as calmness in the face of social pressure.  
Simply put, in a cold approach pickup, the woman becomes attracted to you because you’re more relaxed than she is.  
That’s all.  
That might seem strange, but it’s actually not.  
The very fact that you approached the girl at all demonstrates a massive amount of confidence and social value (either real or potential).  
So once you’ve approached the girl and gotten her into a conversation, the game is yours to lose. She’ll inevitably become attracted to you because you’re a man, and because you have a stronger frame than she does.  


&nbsp;


**5\. Relax**  
You will approach women, and you will make mistakes. That’s fine. Women don’t want you to be perfect. They only want you to be a man.  
You are not physically perfect. Neither am I. Neither is anyone.  
Women are not looking for perfection. They’re only looking for a man who has a *stronger psychological frame* than they do.  
And fortunately for you, you already have a naturally stronger frame than women.  
An example of this is how women will freak out over spiders or mice, jump up and down, scream, and so on, whereas a man will calmly deal with the situation without it breaking his frame.  


&nbsp;


**6\. She tests your frame to test your masculinity. The two are the exact same thing.**  
Women are attracted to *masculinity*. And masculinity can be defined as a measure of how much pressure a man can endure without it breaking his frame.  
When you approach a hot woman, she immediately starts trying to break down your frame.  
She’s testing it for strength.  
If your frame crumbles in the face of her frame, she knows you’re not a man — because men have a stronger frame than women.  
Fortunately, your frame will not crumble. A girl’s frame will always “buckle” under yours after you pass several of her tests. It’s instinctual. Women want to be with the strong man. When she sees you have a strong frame she starts getting wet.  


&nbsp;


**7\. “Listen, smile, nod, agree — then do what the fuck you were gonna do anyway.” (Robert Downey Jr.)**  
Women test me all the time. Women have said things to me that are totally brutal — called me ugly, too short, a loser, etc.  
Most of the women I approach will make a weird face or pretend to ignore me for the first 10-20 seconds.  
It doesn’t penetrate. It doesn’t cause any emotional reaction whatsoever inside me. I smile, nod, agree and then keep talking to her as if she’s being nice to me.  
Eventually, she starts responding. Then she starts laughing. And then we have sex.  
A woman’s frame will ALWAYS buckle under yours. It’s not a question of “if”, but “when”.  


&nbsp;


**8\. Chasing hot girls gives you a “charge”**  
When you’re first getting into game, it’s fine to only approach 5s and 6s.  
Many of these girls will be super nice to you, and that’s cool. A lot of them are fantastic in bed.  
But once you start to get some experience, you’re naturally going to want to move up the ladder and start laying 8s, 9s and 10s.  
This is a natural instinct, and it’s good. It’s okay to chase girls just because they’re hot. These girls want you to chase them. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t make themselves hot.  
Part of being a man is that you can appreciate a woman’s beauty and femininity. It gives you a charge. And pursuing women who are “out of your league” (by society’s false standards) also gives you a charge.  


&nbsp;


**9\. Seducing a 9 is no different from seducing a 5**  
The process of attraction is exactly the same. The only difference is that the hot girl’s frame is stronger than the chubby girl’s.  
But ultimately, no matter how strong a hottie’s frame is, your frame will always be stronger, because you’re a man.  


&nbsp;


**10\. Women will test you brutally when they want to sleep with you**  
When you approach any hot girl, she’ll test your frame HARD to see if it’s strong.  
She’ll act like a bitch. She’ll pretend to ignore you. She’ll tell you outright to go away.  
She wants to see if you’ll buckle to social pressure, or if your frame will remain calm and consistent regardless of external feedback.  
She actually WANTS to sleep with you — but she needs to test your strength first.  
Don’t be fooled by the bitch persona for a second. It’s a carefully cultivated TEST.  
Most men fail the test because they don’t even realize they’re being tested.  


&nbsp;


**11\. Fight Club analogy**  
Getting a hot woman into bed is like the hazing scene in Fight Club where the new recruits are lined up outside the door.  
Tyler berates the recruits with personal insults. “Too old, go away.” “Too fat, go away.”  
He forces them to stand outside for days. He tells them there’s no possibility they’re getting in. Most give up. But the few who stay are ultimately invited inside.  
Seducing the hottest women is the same. It’s a WAR OF ATTRITION.  
Women will fuck pretty much any guy who’s around at the end of the night so long as he has a stronger frame than she does.  
But you have to stick around. You can’t leave when she insults you or acts like she doesn’t want to talk to you. If you do, you’re failing her tests.  
We’ll get into the mechanics of passing these tests in a moment. First we need to talk about inner game, which is the basis of out-framing anyone.  


&nbsp;


---------


&nbsp;


**PART 2:  INNER GAME**  


&nbsp;


**12\. The battle is won or lost inside you before it’s ever fought**  
We’ve said that the only way to AROUSE a woman to the point that she wants to sleep with you off cold approach is to pass her tests.  
How do you pass these tests?  
The first principle is to understand is that all tests are FRAME tests. The entire purpose of tests is to see if you have a strong frame that won’t buckle under pressure.  
Therefore, it’s useless begin with talking about “how to pass tests”. The real value is in having a strong frame to begin with. As Sun Tzu says in the Art of War, “every battle is won or lost before it’s ever fought.”  


&nbsp;


**13\. The “I am enough” frame = the gold dust that gets you 9s and 10s**  
The basis of your inner game is the idea that “you are enough”. In other words, you have value to women simply because you’re a man.  
Everything else is built upon that foundation.  
You don’t have to “do” anything to attract a girl. She’s attracted to you simply because you’re more relaxed than she is.  
You don’t have to change anything. You don’t have to improve your “game” beyond what it’s at now. You don’t need to become better looking.  
You CAN do all these things if you want and they will help you. But you don’t have to.  
You’re already “good enough” simply because you’re a man — because you’ve got testosterone and a dick. Women value that.  


&nbsp;


**14\. Men and women are meant to get together**  
We fit together like a key and a lock.  
There have been studies done in which women smell men’s sweaty t-shirts, and it changes the chemistry of their brain — making them more relaxed and calm.  
Your “male-ness” is inherently attractive to women. Same way as their femininity is inherently attractive to you.  


&nbsp;


**15\. Standards are a myth — everyone is a horny scoundrel**  
We have been brainwashed in our culture into believing that people (women) have something called “standards”.  
Women don’t have any standards — not really. Neither do men.  
Imagine you’re naked in bed with a “4”. She’s kinda chubby, plain face, you probably wouldn’t be proud of the lay, whatever. But her skin’s soft, she smells good, and she’s naked and wet.  
Are you going to say no?  
Probably not, if we’re being honest with each other. You’d almost definitely fuck her if you could be CERTAIN that (a) she’d leave afterwards, and (b) no one would find out.  
There’s a natural magnetism between men and women. We have no willpower around each other.  
Women are the same way. Take it from someone who’s “shot out of his league” too many times to count.  


&nbsp;


**16\. Be her cheat meal**  
You can be a “4” and she can be a “9”. *If the circumstances are right*, she’ll fuck you so long as there’s no downside. Why? Because sex feels good.  
Even the hottest, slimmest yoga bunny pigs out on pizza every once in a while. It’s human nature. We’re not strong. We’re weak.  
We pretend to have “standards” to the outside world. But down deep inside, no one has any standards, and we know it. We have no will, no self-control.  
Hot women are the same.  
If you can hold frame, pass a woman’s test, and lead her to somewhere sex can happen while creating plausible deniability, she WILL fuck you.  
You’d be amazed how easy it is when you get it down.  


&nbsp;


**17\. Stop thinking you need to be an “alpha” to get hot girls — helpful at first but it will ultimately stress you out**  
Your frame is: “I am enough.”  
Your frame is NOT “I’m a badass alpha who’s better than everyone”.  
That’s hard to uphold in the face of conflicting evidence, and will cause cognitive dissonance and stress.  
It’s simply: “Women and men are meant to get together. I’m a man. Therefore, women are already attracted to me on some baseline level.”  
That’s not a hard frame to maintain. It doesn’t stretch the truth. It doesn’t cause cognitive dissonance.  
And therefore it’s MUCH MORE RESILIENT in the face of tests and resistance — which is the most CRITICAL element to getting the hottest  girls.  


&nbsp;


**18\. Cultivate a “reality distortion field”**  
In order to do this, you must fully INTERNALIZE the “I am enough” belief system.  
Understanding it in theory isn’t enough. You have to feel it with your whole “mass”. You have to believe it with total, unquestioning, brainwashed conviction.  
The more you think about the idea that there’s no reason you’re not enough, the more it will feel “true”. (Things become true to us through repetition, not through logic.)  
Use self-hypnosis if necessary. Find every reason you can to support the belief that you’re enough, while cultivating “deliberate blindness” to anything that contradicts it.  
Don’t be a slave to logic. Make logic a slave to you. This is how you cultivate a “reality distortion field”.  


&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**PART 3: HOW TO MAKE WOMEN HORNY BY PASSING THEIR TESTS**  


&nbsp;


**19\. Enduring tests = building attraction**  
When you approach a woman, she immediately starts testing you. By passing her tests, you demonstrate that your frame is stronger than hers. This makes her horny for you.  
Women are wired in such a way that they can’t become wet for a man unless he’s overcome some kind of *resistance* to get her.   Hence, tests actually help you to seduce her. You want her to test you. The more tests you endure, the faster she’ll sleep with you.  
When a girl is so into you that she doesn’t test you, this is how you end up on a 3rd date with a woman who still won’t put out.  
Tests are your friend.  


&nbsp;


**20\. Passing tests is where ALL attraction is ultimately generated.**  
Attraction is NOT generated by pickup lines and witty comebacks.  
Attraction is NOT generated by manipulation techniques.  
Attraction is NOT generated by looks or money.  
All of these things WILL increase your probabilities of getting laid, and make your game smoother and more streamlined.  
But they’re NOT what builds ATTRACTION.  
The one and ONLY thing that builds attraction is ENDURING A WOMAN’S TESTS.  
The reason for this is obvious when you think about it:  


&nbsp;


**21\. Enduring her tests = ability to overcome adversity = GOOD GENES**  
Women have to see you have a strong frame, because otherwise they have no confidence that you’ll be able to protect them and remain calm in the face of danger.  
And the ONLY way they can figure out if you have strong frame is by testing you, being bitchy, insulting you, brushing you off, ignoring you, etc.  
That might seem “unfair” to you.  
But if you can’t handle the abuse from some blonde chick in a bar, how the fuck are you going to handle beating a 7ft tall man to death with your bare hands when he and his tribe invade your village and try to gang-rape your girl?  
Think about it.  


&nbsp;


**22\. Women aren’t built for Starbucks. They’re built for the African savannah.**  
Women aren’t built for the modern world. They’re built for nature, red in tooth and claw.  
If you understand that, you’ll do things differently. You won’t take it so personally when you approach a girl and she tries to destroy you.  
It’s necessary.  
Hot women aren’t acting bitchy to you because of feminism. They’re acting bitchy to you because they WANT to fuck you — but they can only do so after they’ve proved that you have a stronger frame than they do.  
This is instinctual. It’s part of the natural order.  
Innate female bitchiness existed long before feminism. Testing men who approach them is encoded into female DNA.  
When you get bitter at hot women for testing you, you’re being just as anti-nature as feminists themselves.  


&nbsp;


**23\. Eliminate self-destructive beliefs**  
There’s a common myth in the seduction community that a girl who acts “bitchy” to your approach is fundamentally flawed and therefore “not worth pursuing”.  
This is totally ludicrous.  
In fact, it’s just an incidence of “sour grapes” — cognitive games we play with ourselves to rationalize that the grapes we can’t reach are sour.  
The reality is that if a girl has ANY VALUE WHATSOEVER, then she will test you hard during your first approach.  


&nbsp;


**24\. Embrace tests**  
Do you want a woman who says yes to every cock who comes along without putting up the slightest resistance?  
Or do you want a woman who actually DISCRIMINATES among men based on their value — and who CHOSE YOU over hundreds of other suitors because you had the highest value?  
If you’re a normal, healthy man, you want the second woman — and that means you must LOGICALLY EXPECT her to test you hard, and to test you with everything she’s got.  
And you must not only expect tests, but APPRECIATE them.  
You LIKE it when a girl acts bitchy on your approach. It means that if you settle down with her, she’s likely to act bitchy to OTHER GUYS who approach her, scaring them away.  
The higher a woman’s value (in looks and character), the harder she will test you by ACTING “boring” and “bitchy”. This is the way it is and will be. This way and not some other way.  
Luckily, passing tests is the fastest way to create arousal and horniness. This means that, paradoxically, the hottest women are often the easiest to seduce if you know how to pass their tests.  


&nbsp;


**THE TWO CATEGORIES OF “TESTS” HOT GIRLS WILL GIVE YOU, AND HOW TO PASS THEM**  
Women will give you two types of tests — active tests and passive tests.  


&nbsp;


**25\. Active tests**  
Active tests are covered frequently in PUA literature.  
When a woman insults you, belittles you, mocks you, or says something provocative to get a reaction — these are all examples of active tests.  
Common “brush-off” lines like telling you she has a boyfriend, saying you’re a nice guy, telling you LJBF — these are also active tests.  
I won’t talk much about passing active tests as this material has already been done to death in the redpill/PUA world. (Just look up anything on “shit tests”.)  
Suffice to say, the best way to pass active tests is to either:  
a. Agree and amplify.  
b. Ignore the test and continue as if you didn’t even hear it.  
Generally speaking, getting active tests is VERY GOOD. If the girl’s actively testing you, it means she’s definitely interested. It’s also a very easy way to demonstrate your strength of frame by being a charming asshole in response.  


&nbsp;


**26\. How to get past her “bitch shield” persona and into her knickers: recognize and endure passive tests**  
But there is another type of test, which is MUCH more important to understand.  
This is the PASSIVE TEST. This is almost NEVER covered by PUA/redpill literature — yet these tests are actually the most COMMON you’ll encounter, particularly when dealing with 9s and 10s.  
Passive testing happens when you approach a girl and she appears to be INDIFFERENT, BORED, or ALOOF.  
“Resting bitch face” is a passive test. Giving you only one word answers is a passive test.  
And — my favorite — when you go to approach a hot girl and she looks at you with a face of half-disgust, half-horror, and runs away.  
Utterly BRUTAL as it seems — yes, even THAT is a test.  


&nbsp;


**27\. Don’t confuse passive tests with “rejection”**  
99% of guys interpret passive tests as REJECTION. Even natural alphas do.  
And that’s totally understandable.  
I mean, it makes sense right?  
If you approach a stunner and she takes one look at you before making a “creeped out” face to her friend, and then they run away — that’s obviously a rejection, right?  
Well, what if I told you that at least half the women I’ve slept with in my life reacted like that (or similarly badly) when I approached them?  
Here’s a particularly good example:  


&nbsp;


**28\. “Rejection” is not rejection**  
There was this girl I went to college with. Brunette, hot, did modeling work in her spare time, socially was one step down from a “minor celebrity” in my city.  
Probably one of the 10 or 15 hottest girls in my college.  
I always wanted to fuck this girl, because she seemed smart and interesting as well as just hot. But I rarely saw her around.  
One day she passed me in the stairwell, and I thought “this is probably the only chance I’m ever going to get”.  
So I approached her and blurted. “Hi, I’m Mike”. Good eye contact. Held my hand out to shake hers. Whatever.  
She looked at me like I had leprosy.  
I mean, she literally RECOILED. Her eyes went wide in horror, as if I was trying to infect her with AIDS.  
She shook my hand limply and muttered some social nicety back, then ran away swiftly.  
WOW… Now THAT’S a rejection, right?  
Well, the story has an addendum. That woman is now my girlfriend. Has been for three years. She’ll probably be the mother of my children.  
So what’s going on here?  
If she was attracted to me (which she later told me she was), why did she appear to “reject” me?  
Answering this question is the THE KEY to mastering all of game and social dynamics. You ready?  
Ok, here we go:  


&nbsp;


**29\. You are TOO HIGH VALUE**  
Yes, you read that correctly.  
When you’re getting “rejected” by girls, it’s because YOU’RE TOO HIGH VALUE FOR THEM, and it makes them nervous and self-conscious.  
Stay with me here. I know this sounds paradoxical, but try to grasp it.  


&nbsp;


**30\. Women are nervous around you**  
When you approach a woman out of the blue, it demonstrates a LOT of value. More than you probably realize.  
This is because 97% of guys DON’T APPROACH AT ALL. (Those who do are usually drunk and sloppy.)  
This means that if you’re an average to fair looking guy, and you cold approach a girl, you’ve just put yourself in the top 3% of men in terms of confidence.  
In other words, she is going to naturally ASSUME that you are an alpha male (whether this is true or not).  
This makes her NERVOUS and SELF-CONSCIOUS. She’s ill at ease around you because she wants to make a good impression.  
So she tries to act “cool”, “aloof”, and “standoffish”… because she feels awkward.  
She says bitchy things… because she can’t think of anything else to say.  
She run aways… because she feels anxious around you and doesn’t know what to do next.  
In other words: you’re coming across as TOO HIGH VALUE.  
Women are nervous around you. Be patient with them!  
Dumb yourself down. Hold frame, tease them, keep smiling warmly.  
Eventually they’ll open up and start laughing, flirting back, and ultimately get turned on by the fact that you out-framed them in a way no other man ever has.

**BONUS:  THE 6 MOST COMMON TESTS HOT GIRLS WILL GIVE YOU AND HOW TO PASS THEM IN A WAY THAT BUILDS ATTRACTION**  


&nbsp;


**#1\. You approach her, say hi, and she makes a weird face, or pretends to ignore you.**  
Simply keep talking as if you expect her to talk back. She’s nervous and self-conscious and *doesn’t know what to say*. That’s why she’s acting “bitchy” — you’re too high value for her and she feels anxious, causing her to try to act cool.  
Don’t react to her. Keep your body language open and relaxed. Warm smile, unwavering eye contact. Keep talking. Eventually she’ll start talking back and responding positively.  


&nbsp;


**#2\. You’re talking to a girl and she acts indifferent or aloof, only gives you one word answers, or keeps looking off into the distance**  
Again, you simply have to ENDURE IT. Keep talking, keep being playful. Teasing her a little bit never hurts either. “Are you this charming with all the guys?” “This bitchy cheerleader persona you’re putting on is really turning me on, please keep it going ;-)”  
When she sees you’re not going to go away so easily, her frame will crack. She’ll start to smile. Attraction.  


&nbsp;


**#3\. You’re talking to a girl and she leaves to go to the bathroom, says “I have to go find my friends”, or runs away for no apparent reason.**  
Let her go. Then re-approach her later. I can’t tell you how many girls have run off on me, then I approach them half an hour later and they’re like “Oh it’s you!” and then we hook up.  
Why do women leave? Again, they’re NERVOUS.  
Have you ever approached a hot girl and things were going TOO WELL? The girl is smiling and laughing…. she’s responding well… and…. you freak out! You don’t know what else to do, but you don’t want to fuck it up, so you leave set!  
GIRLS DO THIS TOO. Women will “run out of things to say” and run away because they’re nervous and overwhelmed by being in a high value person’s presence, same as guys will.  
Let her go, then re-approach her next time you see her.  
She will respond extremely well 90% of the time in my experience. She’ll literally be GRATEFUL to you that you gave her another chance. Women have told me this explicitly.  


&nbsp;


**#4\. If you’re talking to a girl and she tells you outright that you should leave, or says “well, you should go back to your friends”, “it was nice meeting you”, etc.**  
Smile, nod, agree, and then continue talking to her as if she said nothing. Never leave set because a girl tells you to.  
SHE can walk away if she wants. She has that right.  
But in a public space like a bar or nightclub, you’re well within your rights to talk to whoever you want.  
It’s Saturday night. It’s a social environment. You’re mixing with people.  
You’re free to talk to whoever you want, and she’s free to walk away at any time.  
But if she tells YOU to leave, it’s simply a test of your frame. She wants to see that you won’t buckle under social pressure.  
Pass the test by ignoring it. If she tells you to leave again, look her in the eye with a sly smile and say “You’re free to go if you want to.”  
Her eyes will light up and she’ll punch you in the arm. Pussy dampening commences.  


&nbsp;


**#5\. You’re talking to a woman and there’s an uncomfortably long lull in the conversation.**  
Stare into her left pupil while saying nothing. Instant sexual tension.  


&nbsp;


**#6\. You approach a woman, or a group of women, and they attempt to mock or belittle you.**  
They’re nervous around you because you’re the alpha male in the environment. (As demonstrated by the fact that you approached.)  
They feel uncomfortable in your presence because you’re high value, and so they’re trying to maintain frame by making nervous jokes.  
Smile, nod, agree, and keep talking to them AS IF they were being perfectly nice to you. If you act like they’re being civil, eventually their frame will buckle to yours and they actually WILL begin to act civil.  
That’s the nature of having a stronger frame: you create reality. Other people adjust themselves to it.  


&nbsp;


---------


&nbsp;


**TL;DR**  


&nbsp;


**1\.** Women value you because you have a STRONGER FRAME than them. That’s all.  
**2\.** To figure out if you’ve got a strong frame, women test you. These tests come in the form of indifference, bitchiness, aloofness, personal insults, etc.  
**3\.** You don’t have to do much to pass these tests. You just have to ENDURE them, keep talking to her, teasing her a little and being normal. Over time, her frame will buckle and she’ll become aroused by you because she sees you have a strong frame that can’t be pushed around.  
**4\.** Attraction is a passive, not an active process. You attract hot girls by outframing them. You outframe them by enduring their tests without it breaking your frame. Eventually they “buckle” to you and become wet, laugh at your jokes, ask you what you’re doing later, etc. Then you can take her hand and lead her to the sex location and she’ll be compliant.  
**5\.** The hotter the woman, the harsher will be her tests. Paradoxically, this can actually make hotter women easier to attract, because if you can endure her tests you stand out massively from other guys. Compare to an average girl: her tests won’t be as hard, so you have to pass more of them and spend more time with her before she can see you’re strong

962,6s4mfa,"**Practical Stoicism Tools**

Stoicism philosophy is on the rise. I have been practising it for a couple of years now and would like to share 3 of the most effective and practical mental exercise/meditations that I have used.

##**Method One: A view from above**##

*'You can rid yourself of many useless things among those that disturb you, for they lie entirely in your imagination; and you will then gain for yourself ample space by comprehending the whole universe in your mind, and by contemplating the eternity of time, and observing the rapid change of every part of everything, how short is the time from birth to dissolution, and the illimitable time before birth as well as the equally boundless time after dissolution'* 

**– Marcus Aurelius**

Marcus Aurelius advises us to perform an exercise called 'view from above'. This exercise involves us envisioning ourselves from the third person. In this vision, we zoom out while keeping ourselves in the centre. We continue zooming out and contemplating the scale of the universe.  For instance, your first zoom might encompass a view of you from above the roof of your house. Increase the magnitude and you might see a view of your street, increase the magnitude and you might see a view of your country. Keep going until you can picture a view of Earth from the stars. 

With this scale, we can gain a better perspective on the insignificance of our problems. When compared to the universe whatever problems we might appear incredibly trivial.  For instance, if you were feeling down because a girl flaked on you or someone insulted you, try this exercise. It is far easier to overcome the emotional hurdles we experience when we put things into perspective. 

##**Method Two: Negative visualization**##

*'Remember that all we have is “on loan” from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission—indeed, without even advance notice. Thus, we should love all our dear ones, but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever—nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long.'*

**- Seneca**

Negative visualization despite the name is an exercise that will increase your default level of happiness if practised consistently.The exercise consists of you envisioning what it would feel like if you lost certain things from your life. 
Some of the things that you could consider during the exercise are:

•	How it would feel to not have a roof over your head.

•	How it would feel to lose social status.

•	How it would feel to live in a third world country.

•	How it would feel to have a physical disability.

•	How it would feel to lose a loved one.

This exercise is not meant to be dark or morbid, it’s meant to put things into perspective. Allowing you to see how lucky you truly are. It also prepares you for the worst case scenarios in which one of these things does happen. **You are not meant to fixate on these thoughts, but consider them from time to time.**

This is a very practical way for you to practice gratitude, naturally, when you consider things being removed from your life, you start to gain a sense of gratitude.
 Now gratitude is important because of a thing called ‘hedonic adaptation’, basically, it’s a term that defines the tendency for humans to always go back to their default level of happiness. 

If you won the lotto and became a millionaire, your base level of happiness will increase for a while. However, when you become accustomed to the lifestyle, despite all the new toys, you will return to your base level.
 Gratitude breaks this pattern, allowing you to enjoy each step on the ladder. You can be grateful when you own a box, and you can be grateful when you own a Lamborghini Avendator.  

##**Method Three: Voluntary Discomfort**##

*'But neither a bull nor a noble-spirited man comes to be what he is all at once; he must undertake hard winter training, and prepare himself, and not propel himself rashly into what is not appropriate to him'*

**- Epictetus**

The last exercise has been advised to us by Epictetus. It is called 'voluntary discomfort'. In this exercise, we are going to deliberately put ourselves through uncomfortable situations. We will do this in order to train ourselves to not hold onto comfort with such high regard.
We can perform voluntary discomfort in a number of ways.
Some suggestions are:

•	Cold Showers

•	NoFap

•	Exercising in the morning 

•	Walking in the cold without a jumper

•	Fasting for a day

•	Sleeping on the floor

All these things will change your relationship with comfort. Once you overcome the need for comfort, life will become much easier. Setting your goals and sticking to them will be far easier. When most people complain about being ‘uncomfortable’, you won’t be able to relate. You are literally training yourself to be like a Navy Seal. This method will harden you up for life.

 Eventually shit will hit the fan at some stage during your life. You want to have to mental and physical fortitude to weather the storm.

So those are the three stoic exercises. Stoicism is a practical philosophy that has survived the test of time due to its universal applications. If you practice these stoic meditations, you will be well on your way to the good life.

A common scenario: a woman becomes pregnant by ""accident"", her fling/ex/one-night-stand does not want to be a parent, but the courts end up forcing the man to pay child support for the next 18 years of his life, most of which may never go towards the child. 

Of course, we are told that this is completely normal and acceptable. Both parents have a responsibility towards the kid. You can't opt out of being a parent. The child support is for the *child's* benefit. If you didn't want a kid, you shouldn't have had sex. And so on, and so on. 

Except when it's a man that's forcing his girl to pay child support. Then, according to much of Reddit, he's a scumbag, a lying asshole, his child is to be pitied for being raised by him, etc. 

In this instance, a 20-year-old man posted on Legal Advice asking for help. His ex-girlfriend was pregnant and wanted to put the child up for adoption when it was born, against his own wishes. He wanted to raise the child, even if he had to do so as a single parent. He said that he earned enough to support the child on his own and he was willing to take on the responsibility. 

He was informed that his ex could not put the child up for adoption without his consent and that he should get a lawyer, register his paternity, and push for his custodial rights. 

Yesterday, he came back with an update. He got a lawyer, managed to prevent his ex from putting the child up for adoption, and is now raising his daughter as a single parent, with his ex signing over her custodial rights. And oh yeah, after this all happened and he had his daughter, he also got his lawyer to file for child support and his ex now has to pay child support for the next 18 years, and she phoned him up livid, swearing at him and calling him every name in the book. 

A very common scenario that often occurs with the man having to pay the child support, but now that it's the woman, plenty of people have some choice thoughts for this man. 

> I actually feel terrible for the mother. Because if she didn't want the child, she could have easily aborted the baby and this man goes, after the mother gives him full legal custody, and makes her pay child support?

> I don't agree with this at all. (+723)

Yes, she definitely should've aborted her eight-month-old fetus to save money. 

> But that was the point of adoption, so someone could take proper care of the child. This just seems like dirty tactics. (+257)

Want proper care for your child? Put them up for adoption and send them off into the world! 

> She had a plan, but now has to pay child support instead because the father wanted full custody? (+420)

> Now, after he gets custody of the kid, he wants her to pay child support? That kinda negates the point of not being able to support the kid. I'd say that's a dick move on the dad's part. She should have terminated if she knew he would do that. (+596)

Another ""she should've aborted her almost full-term baby"" comment.

> Literally a post why she should have put it up, she'd be in much better position. Crazy. (+4)

If she put her daughter up for adoption, *she* would save money and *her daughter* would grow up without either of her birth parents. Imagine how much of a better position that would be!

> She let him have the kid without a fuss at the end but then he files for child support? Holy shit can't understand how someone could do that. And just imagine the Reddit shitstorm if it had been the other way. (+188)

""Imagine if this happened to a *woman*!""

> She was mislead and lied to. It is incredibly scummy and I now worry for this kid's future having a dad willing to so coldly lie and fuck over someone like that...There needs to be more reason in these laws. (+44)

> Total dick-move to sue for child support. She clearly and expressedly did NOT want this child. She made the process for OP to have the child easy as possible. Had she gone the adoption route, she wouldnt be on the hook for child support, but decided to give the father a chance to parent. Absolutely an asshole thing to do to her. (+10)

> What selfish prick. Also, what an excellent way to make that woman hate him until the day she dies.  (+14)

> I think it's a crappy thing to do, and if I was the mother, and he went after child support, I'd go after visitation rights. Then he may change his mind about wanting child support.

""If I was the woman, I would go after visitation rights and be miserable raising a daughter I don't want *to get back at him*!""

> I am glad I am not the only one that was distressed about the underhanded way he went about getting child-support. His lack of honesty really worries me. (+61)

> I'm conflicted regarding going after child support. In my head I feel it's wrong, if she had put the baby up for adoption then she wouldn't have to pay it for the next 18 years. However if the roles were reversed and the father wanted to put the baby up for adoption and the mother wanted full custody, then i think public opinion would be that the father obviously has to pay. The laws need to change regarding this topic for sure. (+19)

""Now that this has happened to a woman, the laws have to change!""

Also, one comment that made me laugh: 

> You said you weren't smart enough for college? Man, you seem brilliant!

And there are hundreds of other comments, calling him shitty, a scumbag, ice cold, and every other name in the book. 

To be fair, at least half the people in that thread support him and think this is perfectly fine, maybe even the majority. But you can be sure that if this was a woman, nobody would've even blinked twice. 

When a woman is given the same treatment that men undergo all the time, she is seen as a victim. Furthermore, when a woman suffers the smallest consequences for her actions, people will excuse any and all behavior on her part (such as a late-term abortion of a viable fetus to avoid paying child support).

Many of us have pointed out that feminists will avoid and even censor any discussion of rape when it is not committed by white men. The famous example is in Rotherham UK where 1400 children were raped by Muslim gangs, and groomed in prostitution as young as 8 years of age. The right wing were not able to stop it for over a decade as they were labelled racist and islamophobic by the left and feminists. The police and a liberal local government actively covered it up and allowed it; in many cases they said the children were asking for it, essentially. An example of a feminist trying to cover up what had happened, even after the story had become official: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7JmVwMNq4c

On New Years eve 1000 refugees were releasing fireworks and brawling. Gangs of refugees cornered women in subways. Only 10 police were assigned by police to manage the situation. There was one rape and 80 or so sexual assaults. http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/01/04/revealed-1000-migrants-brawl-rape-sexually-assault-steal-one-german-train-station-new-years-eve/ . Also: 
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35231046 . The story is everywhere now, including Reuters and NYT so check your favourite source.

However the default subreddits are not letting this hate speech be told. worldnews has banned it as local news, although it is front page news all across Europe many right wing papers, the number 2 story on BBC, and reported widely in America now. A moderator did however give somebody the real reason: https://i.imgur.com/21U1AIU.png .

Worst of all is that the 2XChromosomes subreddit has deleted all threads talking about the mass sexual assaults and rape in Cologne on that evening. The default sub for females is actively covering up mass sexual assault! 

The silence is deafening. Leftist/Feminists enable rape by attempting to cover up assaults. They choose to virtue signal or fight for agendas that make themselves feel good, even when it results in more rapes for other women. It is the ultimate act of selfishness and hypocrisy.

I know we aren't really activists here, but we can do good by pointing out the progressivism pecking order to women that are close to us: 'oppressed' rapists come before female victims.",965,3.0,0.2734000086784363,"people, feminist, sex, year, well, live, actually, let, question, great"

**Self-Introduction**

&nbsp;

Hello, I am an Asian American, male, age 23, 5'6, 160lb.  It's been several years since I have started this journey. Typical bluepill background. Typical Asian upbringing. School smart but not street smart. High school was a dud and I wanted to committed suicide during my junior year. Been told I was cute before but never had the balls to do anything. Been an orbiter, emotional tampon, ""best friend"", the whole nine yards. 

&nbsp;

My journey started in 2013 when I discovered PUA, then to TRP, then to MGTOW, and now I'm just a guy with a mission in life with bit of knowledge and better boundaries. Went through all the stages of grief and learn to accept women and their.. special ways. They aren't meant to be men so I can't expect them to have the same values as men. Now life tends to be more.. amusing and less.. self inflicting drama. I am way less thirsty around women and no longer asking 'why' about a lot of things. Instead I now know 'why' and tend just shrug things off when they don't work out.  

&nbsp;

Below is a list of ideals I have come across on this journey, things I have struggle with, and the tools that had help me along the way. I ask you to keep an open mind and take everything with a grain of salt. Do you own research and conduct your own experiments and observations. 

&nbsp;

For curious newbies:

* *Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance. And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn't fit in with the core belief. -Frantz Fanon*

**The First Rule of TRP is: You Do Not Talk About TRP. The Second Rule of TRP is: You Do Not Talk About TRP.**

&nbsp;

WARNING: TRP is not a safe subject. *Cue eye-rolls.* The truth is hard to hear and much harder to accept. It is never popular but always a necessity. There are those who would use TRP philosophy incorrectly just like those who use religions or politics to suppress or terrorized others. Keep your mouth shut and your thoughts to yourself whenever these type of topics come up in public. Self-preservation keeps you safe and others safe. Let people think how they want to think.

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Do not talk how 'alpha' you are or how 'beta' someone is in public. It's sad and pathetic. You wouldn't be here if you were a natural alpha. We all were betas. Be humble.*
 * *Do not put down or insult women for not sleeping with you. They are not evil, prudes, bitches, cunts, sluts, whores, or etc because they won't help you get your dick wet. They are human too. They have the freedom of choice and numerous of men to choose from. It is just a different world for women.*
 * *TRP is a brotherhood. For those of you who want to help our brothers who are plugged in, please keep in mind of how much you resisted swallowing the pill. Just keep an ear out when they start dropping hints. They will be ready when they will be ready. Do not force it. You can only lead a horse to water, you can't make it drink it.*

**A Different Perspective than the Standard Disney Dream:**

&nbsp;

Welcome to TRP. Somehow you arrived here because your method of attracting women isn’t working and you are looking for different answers. It is consider madness if you repeat the same action over and over and expect a different result. It is NOT wrong of you wanting to get better at attracting women just as it is NOT wrong of women wanting to be more attractive to men. 

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Use the Five Stages of Grief to identify your emotions and state of mind. It WILL be hard and does take a lot time to come to an acceptance of TRP perspective. It is completely normal to feel negative feelings such as anger, hate, depression, feeling lied to, exploited, ignorant, etc. What you are feeling is the change. You will breakdown. You must breakdown. Then you will rebuild yourself. We men are taught to not express our troubles or negative emotions in public view due to all sorts of backlash if we do. TRP is a safe and anonymous place where you rant your hatred, your negativity, your mistakes, and your grief in the privacy of your own home and your own mind. This is where we can get honest answers, feedback, and guidance from those who were in the similar situations. Be patience, be kind, and be grateful once you are unplugged.*

**Traditional Male Roles in Modern Times?**

&nbsp;

Be on guard with your traditional male role. There are plenty of people willing to take advantage of it. Men roles and women roles are being questioned and everybody is confused. Mother nature will always be the invisible government of the land. However, mankind's 'laws' are always changing, for better or worse. Men, please do some research for your legal rights (or lack of in some areas). Remember, women have the potential to use men as successful objects just as men have the potential to exploit women as sex objects.

**Relationships & the Human's Need to Love**

&nbsp;

Educate yourself about relationships. A lot of relationships fail because one or both parties are not educated about the other sex and/or their own needs and boundaries. Ask yourself honestly and deeply why you want to be in a relationship. You should NEVER depend on one person to fulfill your EVERY single need. Don't put all your eggs in one basket for love, emotional support, loyalty, and etc. Diversify your love between all of your family, friends, coworkers, mentors, etc. Learning to not 'own' another person and be whole and happy on your own is having an abundance mentality. She is NOT yours, it is just your turn.

**Frame Control & Personal Boundaries**

&nbsp;

This is a way to control your reptilian brain or 'reactive' side. Reacting is instinctual.  Responding is a conscious choice.  When something happens, our body is going to react automatically regardless.  The trick is to become aware of this initial reaction, resist doing anything, involve your higher intelligence by considering options, possible ramifications, who you want to be, and what is going to be in your best interest, and, then, choose how to respond. 

* *Man is affected, not by events, but by his view he takes of them. -Epictetus*

* *Recommend Method:*
 * *Stoicism is a great philosophy to adapt.*
 * *You are the CEO of YOUR life. Learn to make decisions for yourself and lead. You are the captain. Let the other person(s) decide if they want to follow. You choose who stays and who goes. Anyone toxic, can include family and friends, need to be let go. All relationships are give and take. Keeping scores in your head is fine but don't get obsess with it. You are the average of the five people you spent your most time with. Crabs in a barrel mentality is an easy red flag.*
 * *Practice saying 'no' out loud with confident and conviction. Learn to say 'sorry' less and only when it is absolutely necessary. Take your time talking. Don't rush things and don't let anyone rush you. Be content during those silent pauses. Gather your thoughts Pick your battles wisely. You can never change a person's world view overnight. Walk away if needed.*
 * *Stay amused. Have a play and/or flirty tone when teasing. It's banter and it's supposed to be fun. Test yourself 'being mean' cautiously. Don't backpetal whenever possible. Never get into a fight with or over a women. You automatically lost frame.*
  * *Imagery training. I have a rather good imagination and tend to play devil advocate with myself. I ""test"" myself against scenarios with my ideal oneities, bitches, AMOG, betas, white knights, femnazi, and etc. You can do it anytime but you must envision REALISTIC solutions. It teaches you where your state of mind is and how much control you have over your emotions and reactions.*

**Sexy Times in Bed**

&nbsp;

Wanting sex is NORMAL for humans. Repeat: Wanting sex is NORMAL for humans. It is a built-in nature for all lifeforms to have sex and reproduce. Just learn to control your biological sexual urges so it doesn't control you. STOP being so thirsty. Sex is great and all but it's not the one thing in this world you should strive for. Your value as a man is not defined by the quantity or quality of women you can bring to bed. Ask yourself honestly and deeply why you want sex. 

* *Destroy the sex glands, whether in man or beast, and you have removed the major source of action. For proof of this, observe what happens to any animal after it has been castrated. A bull becomes as docile as a cow after it has been altered sexually. Sex alteration takes out of the male, whether man or beast, all the FIGHT that was in him -Napoleon Hill*

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Quit using porn and fapping. Practice semen retention. The urge of sex is one of and the MOST POWERFUL driving force of man. You are wasting your drive for fake pixels. (by far one of the hardest thing for me to achieve.)*
 * *Use a condom and wash it out after. Sperm-jackers are real.*
 * *Don't EVER have sex with a drunk girl. You are just asking for a rape accusation.*
 * *For proof of consent: Take selfies throughout the night and save a screenshot of a ""Awesome night"" text and her reply after a night of sex and upload it to the cloud like Google Drive. Invest in a dash cam or home security cameras.*
 * *Don't EVER 'date' coworkers/clients. You are risking your income/job. Don't shit where you eat.*
 * *I used to suffer from premature ejaculation. To last longer, I started doing Kegal exercises and invest in a Fleshlight. Tips I have learned is to use a stopwatch to keep track of time (try to go for 30 mins) and a playlist of sexy songs (YouTube: THE BEDROOM PLAYLIST PT. II R&B/SOUL) to get a sense of a slow thrust rhythm, breathing pace down, mix up body positions, and fingering and licking simultaneously.*

**A Man's Mission In Life & Being Selfish** 

&nbsp;

The most important of concept of TRP is converting your belief from making 'women' being the center of your universe to make 'yourself' the center of your universe. A man's mission should be his MAIN source of happiness. To self-improve is to self-invest which requires you to have self-discipline, learn to love yourself, and put your needs first. An easy concept for self-love is to love and treat yourself like you would love the women of your dreams. Being selfish and putting yourself first is hard for most men to grasp. It is because we have been taught all of our life to self-sacrifice for the greater good of others. Follow your efforts, not your passion. You learn the skills you need in life by searching for it.

* *Recommend Methods:*

Once you have the basic down, get rid of all unnecessary clothes so you can look stylish all the time. Understand that generally ""men"" don't care what men wear but ""women"" do because a woman's SMV is mostly based on her looks. Women invested and max out their looks to gain the attention of high-value men. They compare themselves to other women and thus how their man look too. Remember, your clothes convey non-verbally who you are. If you want to be the guy that girls want to fuck, you got to at least look like the part.

**Talking And Body Language**

&nbsp;

Improve your speech/voice and recognize facial/body language. The percentage of types of human communication are consist of: 55% are body movements and facial expression, 38% are voice tone, volume, and pauses, and 7% are words. This is to help you see the subtle signals of attraction or the need to back off.  

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Watch your favorite shows/movies on silent. Look at the actor's facial expression and body movements.*
 * *Stand tall by using the pencil posture test and fix your forward neck or round shoulders by using the 'hang by your teeth' technique.*
 * *Use a computer stand to level your screen higher for a better sitting posture.*
 * *Place a pen in your mouth and start reading out loud. You should be able to pronounce every syllables, talk slower, take breaths and pauses, and get rid of 'umms' and 'uhh'.*
 * *Record yourself reading out loud. To focus on your tone and volume, place your recording device at different distances away from you. This should give you the idea of how loud and clearly you must be speak in order for the person to hear you. You should also listen to pitch of your voice and make sure it stay low.*
 * *Practicing maintaining eye contact by looking in the mirror.*
 * *Learn to sing. For some reason, singing tend to bring people together. When you and another person know the lyrics to a song, it's really cool feeling. Great for singing during car rides and karaoke nights. Take a few singing lessons from a tutor to learn breathing and pitch.* 
 * *Learn how to storytell. Our stories are who we are. Share the jokes, the 'what the fuck' events, the scary adventures and your brainfart moments. You have to 'describe' more than necessary to have her 'live' in the moment.*

Try to keep texting, emails, and any online messenger for logistics. It is a very inefficient tool to use for flirting.

 * *No wall text, no double texting, and write out your texts in compete words, sentences, and correct grammar.* 
 * *Use 'statements' formats more often than 'questions' format. (Example: Instead of asking her if she is free, tell her a time, location, and activity of what you will be doing together. Take the lead and assume attraction.)*
 * *Do not drunk text or send nudes. (She got enough dick pics from other guys)*
 * *Make a phone call every once in awhile. Show that you got some balls.*
 * *Easy 'nexting' tells: If she responds back to reschedule, she is into you. However, if she 'stalls' without rescheduling, she is not into you. 2-3 strikes and she's out.*

**The Art of Seduction**

&nbsp;

Learning seduction or just basic female interaction. THIS is only when you are at a healthy mindset, have good habits formed, and basically got your shit together. PUA without TRP is basically bluepill mindset but redpill acting.

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Make sure your logistics are in order before going anywhere, anytime. You will never know when the next opportunity will arise. Transportation? Check. Bedroom clean? Check. Condoms? Check.*
 * *You must LEAD at all times. IT IS YOUR responsibility to make the FIRST move and every move after that.*
 * *3 second rule: When you see an attractive women, don't think, approach. This gives your brain no time to develop any excuses. Don't restrain yourself to just weekends or night venues. Women are everywhere.*
 * *ACCEPT REJECTIONS GRACEFULLY. You CAN'T attract/have sex with every attractive woman you see. There are too many factors to why a woman rejects you. Just say 'thank you for your time' and move on.*
 * *For first few outing keep it: fun, casual, interactive, cheap/free, kino friendly, and low pressure. Never start off with a dinner or movie. Get ice cream cones, bowling, arcade, laser tag, a walk around a park, putt putt golf, hiking, swimming at beach/pool, board games, and etc.*
 * *Topics to avoid: religion and politics.*
 * *Topics to use: music, movies/tv shows, food you love/hate, adventures, places you have been, happy childhood memories, scary stories, jokes, people watching, the surrounding environment, etc.*
 * *Don't be afraid to touch her! Sit next to her, hold her hand, high fives, hugs, fist bumps, make her twirl, hand slapping game, and etc.*
 * *Kino map: Shoulder -> upper arm -> wrist -> hands.*  
 * *When going for the kiss, make sure to isolate her from the public view or from people she knows. A person's public reputation can greatly differs from their private desires.* 
 * *Keep a little fun sexual tension alive. Use sexual innuendos. Wink, slowly bite lower half of lips, slowly lick top half of lips, smirk, grab/slap her ass playfully, and etc.*
 * *Push and Pull during the interaction. You're not sprinting to the finish line. Escalate and rest on your terms. Give her room to chase. Think it like baking a cake.*

**Final Words:**

&nbsp;

Don't take life too seriously. We live in a very fucked up world. Somewhere, someone else has it worse than you. You were at the bottom but now know the way up. Work hard but do enjoy the little moments and achievements. Laugh at your mistakes and look at how far you had come. Don't compare your life to others or how perfect it 'should' to be. Success in life is when you can smile and say 'yeah, that was fun'.

",966,4.0,0.33379998803138733,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
967,64mvgf,"I hate it when people try to oversimplify pick-up, but if I had to boil down pick up into one principle every man should understand, it is this: The woman must be more emotionally invested in you than you are in her at every stage of the relationship. I call this the IRON LAW OF SEDUCTION. 

Understanding and correctly applying this law will solve 99% of the problems men have with women. She’s not responsive to your advances? Not emotionally invested enough. Not returning your calls? Not emotionally invested enough. Flaking? Not emotionally invested enough. On the flipside, as a man, if you emotionally divest yourself from girls, you solve most your own problems. Outcome dependent? You are too emotionally invested in getting laid. Approach anxiety? You are too emotionally invested in the success of the interaction. Neediness and desperation? You are emotionally invested in getting girls. Suck at conversations? You are too emotionally invested in getting laid and can’t just have a regular conversation. 

Emotional investment is subconsciously communicated and women evolved to sense it. One guy can talk to a girl all night without her feeling like he is emotionally invested, but another can talk to her for 2 seconds and get auto-rejected for being too invested. Of course, a woman may talk to you, hang out with you, fuck you, or even date you for a long time if she’s not emotionally invested because she’s horny, crazy, lonely, desperate, drunk, bored, want something from you, etc.... But if she’s not emotionally invested, you are on thin ice and vulnerable at any time to flaking or going cold.  

**What is emotional investment?**

Emotional investment is occupying one’s thoughts and emotions. It is not the same as being interested or “liking” somebody. I “like” a lot of people but I don’t “feel” anything for them and it wouldn’t hurt my feelings if they rejected me or even died.  This distinction is why women flake. Women “like,” get “interested,” and give their numbers to lots of guys, but if she is not at least a little emotionally invested she will not be motivated to get out of bed, put on her make-up, and come somewhere to meet you. Unlike men, women get invited to shit all the time by guys they “like” so they are not going to care about meeting you unless there is some emotional investment.  

Think about emotional investment like this: like most men, you probably like Lamborghinis. But like most men, you probably don’t have one, and you probably don’t spend all day thinking about Lamborghinis and being sad because you don’t have one. But if I lent you a Lamborghini for two months and you drove it around, took care of it, showed it off to your friends, and got laid because of it, you would be sad when I take it back. It’s irrational, but you would get emotionally invested in the Lambo even if you weren’t sad when you never had one. Because you became attached to it and it gave you a sense of identity and power, the Lambo took up space in your thoughts and emotions, making you emotionally invested. 

Emotional investment in people is similar. Being around somebody awesome and feeling like they “belong” to you  becomes addictive like crack. An awesome man makes a woman feel special, loved, important, powerful, and cool. An awesome man is also fun, positive, confident, carefree, and dominant, easing the woman’s anxieties and insecurities. Being around an awesome guy is literally like a drug to women, and if they are around you long enough, they become hooked. 

**The Ben Franklin Theory**
 
Ben Franklin, one of America’s founding fathers and greatest poonhounds, famously and counterintuitively discovered that if person A does something for person B, person A will like person B more. Most people would assume the opposite – if you want people to like you, you should do things for them, so person B should like person B more! Right? Wrong!

Person A “likes” person B more because person A has become emotionally invested. Maybe person A subconsciously expects person B to do something nice back. Maybe person A subconsciously see themselves as “beneath” person B in the ape hierarchy. Maybe person A is protecting their own ego – person B must be somebody special if even I did something for them! Or maybe the simple act of doing something for person B caused person B to enter person A’s thoughts and emotions.
 
Whatever the psychological mechanism, when a woman really likes you, she will WANT to do stuff for you, sometimes even aggressively, and she will WANT to emotionally invest while you fantasize about other things. When a woman really likes you is when you realize that needy, supplicating, validating behavior is not necessary. I have friends that are strippers, and their job is basically to hustle men out of money and to trick guys into buying shit for them. I don’t buy girls things, ever, (and I never, ever visit my friends at work) and I notice that when these strippers start to like me they buy me shit, clean my house, do me favors, etc... One night I even got into an argument with a stripper because she bought me 5 drinks in a row and she wouldn’t let me buy her a drink in return. That’s emotional investment.    
 
**The Woujo Theory**
 
According to my corollary of the Franklin theory, supplicating to a woman, validating yourself to a woman, buying a woman things, following a woman around, allowing a woman to treat you like shit, and spending too much time trying to “help” a woman who doesn’t deserve it subconsciously will cause you to become emotionally invested in her and feel “beneath” her.
 
Sometimes guys will do loserish things, like let a girl treat them badly or repeatedly pursue a girl who doesn’t care about them, and justify it by saying “I don’t really care about her, I just want to fuck.” This is a bad idea, because even though you consciously think you “don’t give a fuck,” by pursuing her, you become emotionally invested, and by allowing her treat you like shit, you subconsciously re-wire your brain to feel like a beta male. Even if you didn't give a fuck before, now you do. 

You can’t control how you feel, but you can control what you do. Where your actions go, your feelings will follow, and where feelings go, your thoughts will follow. If you do loser things, you will eventually feel like a loser, even if you consciously tell yourself you “don’t give a fuck.” If a hot girl tries to strike a Faustian bargain with you and let you fuck her in return for treating you like shit, you must reject that deal out of respect for your own mental health. 

Your brain works by making connections, and when you focus your thoughts and emotions on something, your brain starts connecting that thing to other things in your brain, and that thing becomes “enmeshed” in your wiring, creating a deeper web that is hard to untangle. For example, if you date a really hot girl, your brain will start to associate her with sexual pleasure, or ego, or fun times, and other things you like, so when she dumps you, you will think of her constantly. 

The definition of “not giving a fuck” is only keeping positive thoughts and emotions in your head, and cutting out people, places, activities, thoughts, media, etc... that are negative. “Not giving a fuck” is not about being cold, aloof, an asshole, or stupid, but by filing your thoughts and emotions only with positive things that deserve to be there. 

**Why is emotional investment unattractive?**

Emotional investment is an immediate turn-off. It doesn’t matter why, but I can guess some reasons. 

First, emotional investment is unattractive because people are attracted to lives that are more interesting, exciting, higher, and better than our own. We just assume that somebody living a better life than us is going to be thinking and feeling about their awesome life, not us. If a woman knows she occupies your thoughts and emotions, she will assume your life sucks. She wants to fixate her thoughts and emotions on something higher, but if your thoughts and emotions are fixated on her, she’s back where she started. 

For example, a girl that plays soccer will be attracted to guys that are better at soccer than her because they will appeal to the part of her thoughts and emotions that are invested in soccer. I'm not saying she will never become emotionally invested in a guy who is worse at soccer than she is - she may invest in a guy for other reasons - but the guy is playing with a disadvantage. 

Second, emotional investment is unattractive because, simply put, emotions are bad and scary. Our society acts like “love” is an emotion and “our true selves” are our emotions, but that’s bullshit. Our value lies in what we can do when we are rational, what we’ve learned in our life, what we know how to do, and what we strive to achieve and be when we are clear-headed. Emotions are temporary and fleeting; but true love is a rational, credible commitment to your beloved’s well-being. In his dialogue the Phaedrus, the Greek philosopher Plato said that emotional love is a kind of madness – when things are going well, you are irrationally nice to the person out of proportion to what they deserve. When things are going badly, you are irrationally nasty to the person out of proportion to what they deserve. Women know that when you are irrationally nice to them you will eventually be irrationally shitty. 

Most of our emotions are selfish, irrational, unrealistic, uncontrollable, and oftentimes downright evil. Emotions are fundamentally needy: they always want something, even if the “want” is to help somebody. If you see a beautiful woman and think “I like her, and I want to make her happy and do nice things for her,” you’re lying to yourself. You want things FROM her. You want to fuck her, use her for an ego boost, have your friends see you with her, and make yourself feel better for being a “good person.” You don’t want to see her run off and be happy with another guy, you want her to be unhappy with you. When you show emotion women subconsciously know you want something and that puts pressure on them, and they run away. Women sometimes will hang out with guys they don’t like or aren’t attracted to in any way, just because those guys are not emotionally invested and are not putting any pressure on them.  

When you become extremely emotional, you fantasize about getting your beloved back or hurting them for the wrongs they did to you, you stalk them, you act weird, you feel depressed, you can’t function, etc… Love songs glorify these feelings, but these are not healthy feelings. They are signs of weakness. Women have these feelings things too (oftentimes much more deeply than men), and they know it’s a scary pit to be in, so if they sense for even a second that a man is feeling these things (or is even just slightly beginning to feel these things), they run away immediately. Women want an emotional rock. They want the lifeguard on the edge of the pool pulling them out, not somebody drowning with them. 

Women also take longer to get emotionally invested in men than men take to get emotionally invested in women. Men evolved to seek “fertile” women (big ass, big tits, healthy face) to impregnate as soon as possible. Women, on the other hand, evolved to find the strongest man in the tribe that could protect her and her baby, so they seek a larger group of traits, many of which are long-term traits (confidence, dominance, emotional stability, intelligence, etc…). It takes a woman time to figure out if a guy has these traits but a man can immediately be attracted to a hot girl. In every man-woman relationship there is a period of time where the man is emotionally invested, but the woman is still “rational” and feeling the guy out. Many men fuck it up here – they start acting creepy, or weird, overly nice, overly fixated, and the woman, who feels nothing, thinks the guy isweird or worse. 

Of course, emotions are a part of life and can be beautiful if channeled correctly. But you shouldn’t show your emotions to a woman until she has also developed those emotions. 

Third, emotional investment makes you stupid and saps you of your vitality and awesomeness. Tons interesting, smart, funny, cool, successful guys become vacant shells of their normal selves around women, partly because their thoughts and emotions are empty of everything that makes them awesome. If you are deep in a game of chess and I try to have a conversation with you about quantum physics you will sound stupid because your thoughts and emotions are full of chess. Seduction requires intelligence and creativity, but if your thoughts and emotions are just “durr, she’s a pretty woman” you’re going to fail. Because women are “rational” longer than men, they want to have rational, intelligent conversations about interesting shit. 

Another reason is power. It’s a sad fact of life, but humans are wired to look at relationships in power terms. We subconsciously rank everybody in a particular social situation from least to most powerful. Women are much more aware of the power dynamic because they are generally less powerful than men. And unfortunately, we subconsciously see emotional people as lower in the power hierarchy. The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche said, correctly in my opinion, that individuals higher in the social hierarchy do not feel emotions for people lower than them. The lower ranked apes evolved to obey and be obsessed with the alpha male because they need his protection and resources, but the alpha male feels nothing for the lower ranked apes because he does not need them for anything. 

Most importantly, women are not attracted to emotionally invested men because women are attracted to RESILIENCE. Resilience here means “the ability to confidently pursue your goals and not let anything or anybody perturb you.” 

Women are attracted to resilience because they naturally want a protector, and a protector’s commitment is only credible if he cannot be thrown off of his mission, whatever that mission is. If a protector becomes emotional, dishonest, distracted, or submissive, he can no longer be trusted to protect. We subconsciously see emotional people as weak because they can be easily controlled. If a guy is emotional about a girl, he is likely to agree with whatever she says, let her get away with bad behavior, etc… 

If a protector wavers for even a second, the woman becomes anxious and fearful, but a confident man with boundaries is not scared and cannot be thrown off of his mission. You must be a brick wall that cannot be moved or affected: if you approach her or escalate with her, it is purely based on your own desire, not her cajoling. At every moment you should think to yourself “am I doing this because I want to or because I am trying to impress her”? Sometimes you need to monitor her emotional investment on a moment-by-moment basis. 

**Subconscious communication** 

Women can quickly sense by your body language, words, demeanor, tone of voice and actions whether you are emotionally invested. Neither you nor her may consciously know you’re invested, but you will just “feel” unattractive to her. Sometimes very subtle changes in behavior (staring too long, asking a question that is too intrusive too early) can tip off that you are too invested. 

I use the “gravity theory” to gauge emotional investment. In social settings, high-value people are “bigger” and therefore “draw” lower-value people to them. If you look at any party, you will see hot girls usually in the center, relaxing and having fun, and guys literally surrounding them like planets around the sun. There is a reason these guys are called “orbiters.” If the girl gets up to leave, the guys may play it cool for a while, but they then get up to follow her. Your ultimate goal is to become the center of gravity so women are drawn to you, not vice versa, which is hard, because as a man you must approach. But even if you approach your demeanor and body language can exude the message of “I am the center of gravity, and I create a rip in space-time that compels you to come to me.” 

The subconscious subtext of an interaction is 99%. For example, the sentence “can I buy you a drink” can have a wide range of subconscious meanings depending on the tone, body language, context and emotion I deliver them in. “Can I buy you a drink” can mean “I want to fuck you,” “I feel like I owe you something and I want to pay you back,” “I’m a generous guy and I like to just people free things,” “you’re a good friend, and I want to show my appreciation,” “I’m a loser and I want to make you like me by buying you things,” etc… What matters is not your superficial words, but your subconscious context. 

Because seduction is mostly subconscious, I can’t teach you every detail of the walk, speaking style, body language, demeanor, etc… of a guy who is not emotionally invested. Even if I did, it’s too much for you to remember and process. I even doubted the efficacy of writing this article because it’s incredibly hard to “fake” an emotional state for a long period of time and most people will go back to behaving like what they feel they are.  

**The paradox of escalation**

So far it sounds like the right solution to get girls would be to just ignore them completely. You won’t look emotionally invested, right? Unfortunately, that doesn’t work. It is the man’s responsibility to approach and escalate because women do not get emotionally invested quickly and are afraid of rejection. 

To get a girl attracted to you, you must show at least some initial interest and escalate, luring her into becoming emotionally invested in you. Magicians use a technique called “forcing,” where they trick the person into thinking they are picking a random card out of the deck when the person is really picking the card the magician wanted them to pick. Seduction is similar: she should feel like she is picking you, not vice-versa. You are just opening the door to her. 

**The challenge of seduction**

Seducing a woman while you appear not emotionally invested is incredibly challenging. First, women’s aversion to emotional investment is mostly subconscious – consciously, women want the guy to show at least some interest. And it’s naturally hard to hang around a woman you like for a long period of time and not become invested to at least some degree. Beautiful women create a reality distortion field where men lose all concept of rationality, truth, normal standards of right and wrong, etc… You can say “you’re overthinking this, just be yourself,”, but women touch men’s strongest emotion, so many men literally forget how be themselves. When a beautiful woman walks into a nightclub a swarm of otherwise successful, rational, manly men immediately lose their fucking minds. They start begging for her approval, trying to buy her things, acting stupid, etc… 

And like I said earlier, men emotionally invest quicker than women, so we must be patient because our emotions push us to jump the gun and get right into lovey-dovey mode. And in non-romantic contexts, people become emotionally invested at the same rate, so you are used to the other person feeling the same as you if the interaction is going well. And when we feel emotionally invested in somebody, we naturally are going to want to elicit a positive emotional response. But trying to make a woman happy that is not emotionally invested comes off as validation-seeking, supplicating, bitch behavior. You must instead do what is RIGHT. A woman may seem cold, and we may think we can “warm her up” by being “nice” to her, but we should really just pursue our mission and have faith that she will emotionally invest even though she appears on the surface to not be attracted or care about you. Remember: women are constantly sizing you up, so even if they don’t look like they are attracted or paying attention, they are. 

Seduction is a gamble because you must have faith that eventually the woman will start to emotionally invest, knowing she might not. Sometimes she just won’t like you. Sometimes she just wants attention. Sometimes she is in love with you but won’t let it on. Some women are damaged and never emotionally invest in anybody – they see all men as objects to be used. This is why you must assume attraction – because you DON’T KNOW. 

**How to not be emotionally invested**

If you take away one thing from this article, it is this: a woman who is not yet invested in you must not occupy a big part of your thoughts and emotions. You must have your mind and heart on other things when interacting with women. Period. If she hasn’t made room for you in her head and heart yet, you shouldn’t make space for her in your head and heart. If you make this change right now, I promise your results will instantly improve. Women are the dessert to a good life, not the main course, and that’s how women should feel when you are talking to them. WOMEN WANT TO BE DESSERT.

Here are my main steps to not becoming emotionally invested:

1)      Realize you don’t need to emotionally invest

2)      Have an interesting and awesome life that occupies your thoughts and emotions.

3)      Have “abundance mentality” with respect to women.

4)      Have boundaries and be unperturbable.

5)      Focus on your own fun first.

**Realize you don’t need to emotionally invest**
 
This may be the most important step. I think a lot of guys emotionally invest in girls because society and pop culture subconsciously make us think that for a man to get a girl, he must supplicate to her and emotionally invest in her. In the movies, the confident, successful guy living his own life never gets the girl; instead the winner is the beta loser who falls in love with her from afar, and then spends the rest of the movie trying to “get” her, enduring multiple rejections and humiliations. These movies also teach that women are delicate flowers that need constant coddling and lovey dovey bullshit. That’s not how it works in the real world. 
 
Men also misunderstand women’s aversion to rejection. Women have a strong need to be “accepted” (as all betas do) and therefore are much more sensitive to rejection than men. The phrase “hell hath no fury like a woman scorned” is true. Dread game and “ignoring” women only works if she is ignoring you first. But if you outright reject her, or if she makes a move on you, or asks for acceptance, and you say “no” or she feels like you are ignoring her there is a strong chance she will emotionally “un-invest.” Because women have this strong need for constant acceptance and validation, men mistakenly think they must emotionally invest. But all you really need to do is not reject her or make her feel excluded. It’s a thin line between keeping a woman “accepted” and emotionally investing in her. 

To win this game, you should only do something for a woman if the woman would do it for you. If you want to buy her a drink, think about whether she would buy you a drink. If she wouldn’t, don’t. If she wants you to wait for her, think about whether she would wait for you. If she wouldn’t, don’t. If there is a girl you always say hi to, but she never says hi to you, stop saying hi to her. She knows who you are, she can say hi to you. It’s ok to “win” in relationships. 
 
Again, this is easier said than done. Society and your emotions team up to make you feel like you need to follow girls around, wait for them, put up with their bullshit, buy them drinks, etc… You must fight your feelingss and social training and have faith that if you stay the course women will become attracted. This requires the ability to say “no” to a woman (saying “no” is different than rejecting her) and the ability to walk away from her, even permanently. 
  
**Have an interesting and awesome life that occupies your thoughts and emotions**
 
Humans are wired to seek good feelings. If the main part of our life is not making us happy (job, school, our hobbies), we get those good feelings from other sources: drugs, trashy TV, women, food, etc… All those things are not bad by themselves, but if your regular life doesn’t make you happy, you will overly emotionally invest in bad things and become addicted and depressed. If your life is miserable, you will subconsciously and unknowingly immediately start overly investing in women.

I use the “cheese pizza method.” Whenever I feel like I’m getting too emotional, I fill my thoughts and emotions with something I love – cheese pizza, Oreo cheesecake, the day I did mushrooms at the beach, reading about dinosaurs stoned, etc... This clears my head and allows me to act “normal” around women. When I am thinking about doing something for a girl I ask myself “what has she done to dislodge cheese pizza out of my heart and mind?” You can replace cheese pizza with anything, ideally an incredible, thrilling life that she would want to join. 
 
**Have abundance mentality with respect to girls**
 
No matter how awesome your life is, it is hard to not emotionally invest in girls. Abundance mentality is when your thoughts and emotions are full of other women, so you don’t need this one girl. If you don’t have other girls, you need to delude yourself. I recall times when I did have abundance and put myself back in that mental space. If you’ve never had abundance, imagine you are Brad Pitt or some other celebrity and think about how he would feel and act.

**Have boundaries and be unperturbable**

Women want you to be an immovable wall that confidently and joyfully pursues his mission. She will try to perturb you from that mission, not because she wants to see you fail, but because she wants to test whether you are actually a brick wall or a façade for something softer. The same way you knock on a desk at the furniture store to see if it is real wood, a woman shit tests you to see if you are actually confident enough to pursue your mission or if you will be perturbed. And the more confident and immovable you are, the stronger the shit tests become. This is true even if the mission is getting her! As long as she is into it, you need to escalate as if you already know she will say yes.

Your mission, when out, should be maximum fun. She should sense that your emotional investment is “where’s the party? Where’s the next fun thing?” You should have a plan for the entire night: I’m going to X, then I’m going to Y , etc… You should not let the woman hijack your plans and take the lead. Your primary mission (career, hobbies, etc…) should also be in your head. Remember the song “girls just wanna have fun?” In truth, everybody just wants to have fun but boys are wracked with anxiety because they are trying to impress girls. Whenever you are feeling nervous, scared, anxious or like you are emotionally investing too much in a girl, just say to yourself “I’m here to have fun. If you contribute, great. If not, you are dismissed.” Fun and positivity always win. 

Example: If a beautiful woman is talking about something incredibly boring most men pretend to be interested. Wrong! Women know when they are being boring and it is sometimes a subtle shit test to see if you will let her get away with it. Women are not desperate for sex and they do not need to hang around if a guy is being boring, stupid or mean, and they cannot respect or empathize with a guy who would put up with bullshit from her. Men let women be boring when they lose their vision of the good life. A good life involves beautiful women, but it also involves interesting conversations. If you aren’t getting interesting conversations from her, you would leave because you have options. Whenever a woman is being boring, I change the subject just to let her know I don’t tolerate bullshit.  

By having a vision of the good life, boundaries, and confidence that your life, thoughts and emotions are interesting and valuable, you can challenge and stimulate a woman. Women want a man that will help them grow and introduce them to a better life and more interesting world than the one they currently inhabit. They don’t want some a that agrees with everything they say, a pushover, or a simple-minded conformist.  Women want a guy who is willing to walk away at any time, not because he is some cold-hearted psychopath, but because once a man shows that is he NOT willing to walk away at any time, there is no challenge or growth. 

Of course, for most of you, this is very difficult. Many of you have uninteresting lives so a beautiful woman would instantly become the most interesting and important thing your life or you are so sex starved and desperate that you don’t care if a woman is being boring, or mean, or uninterested, or whatever. 

**Focus on your own fun first**

Imagine you paid $500,000 to spend a week with Leonardo DiCaprio (or whatever celebrity you think lives an awesome life) and when you get there Leonardo says “tell us what we should do?” You would say “I don’t know, what are the options?” and Leo goes “I don’t have anything planned – let’s just do what you were gonna do.” You would be pissed! You want to become part of Leo’s awesome life, not make your own plan. That’s how girls feel when men don’t have a plan. They want to join your life, not lead you around in their life. That’s why you need to focus on your own fun first. You may like you are being rude or selfish, but you’re not, because women are more attracted to the act of leading than the destination necessarily. 

**How to make her emotionally invest in you**

For a woman to emotionally invest in you, certain shit must happen: 

1)	She must “like” you – i.e., she must find you pleasant, friendly, good-looking, compatible with her values and interests. 

2)	She must feel an emotional connection with you.

3)	She must feel accepted by you. If she you are rejecting her, ignoring her, or being hostile, she will not emotionally invest. 

4)	She must watch you be confident and resilient. 

5)	She needs to spend time around you. 

**She must like you**

This one is self-explanatory. Women are usually not going to invest in you if you don’t share their interests, values, goals, etc… Some girls want a rapper covered in tattoos, others want a nerdy guy who watches Star Wars. If you’re a versatile guy with lots of interests, a lot more women will like you, but some people just aren’t compatible. 

**She must feel an emotional connection with you**

The key to developing an emotional connection with a girl is experiencing emotionally exciting things together. The ultimate is of course, passionate sex, but a good concert, a deep conversation, even a beer pong game you guys play together can help build an emotional connection. 

Another way to build an emotional connection is for her to vicariously experience your confidence. She wants you to be her emotional rock, so she would like to project her insecurities and fears onto you, and watch you brush them off as if they were nothing. She also wants to watch you take the lead and make the night fun. 

A woman has emotional energy, and that energy must be directed towards something or somebody. You want that energy to be directed to you. The easiest way to do this is just by spending time around her. Just “being around” will help build attraction as long as you are not fucking it up by being needy or making her feel bad. The best way to get women to like you is to be “forced” to be around them, such as work or a group hangout, where you do not supplicate to them or validate yourself to them. My friend used to take girls out on his boat, and these girls would usually end up liking me by the end of the day because we would have spent all day together. Celebrities get so much tang because women watch them in movies or listen to their music and become emotionally invested, whereas the celebrity shows the women no emotional investment in all. 

**She must feel accepted by you.**

Again, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, so it must feel like the door to you is open. As she invests in you more, you must escalate more. You can fuck this up by being an asshole, not being sensitive to her emotions, and not reading her advances correctly. 

**She must watch you confidently pursue your goals**

The word confidence comes from the Latin con (with) + fidens (faith). A man with confidence has faith that he will succeed in whatever he does and cannot be stopped by anybody. Women get turned by watching a man confidently pursue his mission. Why are women w so attracted to DJs, promoters, and drug dealers in the club? Those guys aren’t exactly the “cream” of society. It’s because those guys are the only people at the club actually doing something. All the other guys are just sitting there drooling over the girls, instantly reducing their attractiveness. 

**Putting it all together**

To apply all this knowledge, my strategy is to adopt a rational, almost businesslike demeanor, at least in the early stages of the interaction. As I said earlier, women are “rational” at the beginning before they are emotionally invested, so you should also be rational. A man must act almost like he is a woman: he is interested in a relationship (or maybe even just sex) but he has high standards and must evaluate the woman thoroughly first and make sure she is suitable before he gets emotionally invested. You should act like your actions are guided by a seduction computer that makes all the decisions based on the available information, not your emotions. 

One technique is called “disinterested interest.” Your rational words should show interest and enthusiasm but you must communicate the “emotion” of “I’m just talking to you to be nice, I am not totally emotionally invested in you yet and I could walk away at any moment.” The best way to do this is by keeping your thoughts and emotions focused on something else, other than her. 

You should not, however, stay completely rational. You must allow yourself to show your emotions about things that are not her: your passions, your interests, your friends, etc… And you can show emotion towards her if she deserves it: laugh if she says something funny, thank her if she does something nice, sympathize with her if she says something sad: just don’t let on that you feel emotional about “her” unconnected to anything she is or has done. 

And of course, escalate sexually. Paradoxically, it is possible to escalate sexually and not appear emotionally invested. In fact, a lot of women (especially damaged ones) are looking for emotionless sex. You must touch her, you must turn the conversation sexual, you must do “seductive” things like look into her eyes and whisper in her ear, etc… And you must confidently take the lead in the conversation and the situation in general, leading her from place to place, getting intimate with her, etc… And when she starts to emotionally invest, make her feel like you MIGHT emotionally invest too (but not as much as her). Sometimes if you play it “too” cool she will think you just like her platonically or that you lost interest. 

**A broader view**

This article is obviously about getting girls, but the principles are applicable in all areas of your life. Simply put, you should not invest your thoughts and emotions into people, places, institutions, and activities that do not give a fuck about you and/or do not produce a return that equals the investment you put into them. One of the biggest mistakes people make is investing too much in their job, friendship, hobbies, etc..., and getting 0 out of it. 

Additionally, whatever you do becomes your emotional investment. If you spend every weekend hanging out with piece of shit people that just do drugs, complain and make bad decisions, guess what, you are now becoming a piece of shit person. You are what you do.

968,6woyzi,"The universe created two types of men--alphas and betas--to serve the purposes of the species: Alphas to lead and impregnate and betas to follow and serve. Some science suggests that in ancient times only 1 out of every 16 men successfully reproduced. Although more betas than this reproduce in modern times due to social order and the institution of marriage, I nevertheless suspect that the 1-in-16 ratio is useful in illustrating a plausible proportion between the two male types today.

Assuming some degree of historical constancy with respect to the above dynamic I see two lessons to take from it: 1. If you're an alpha--sex with dozens of women is a likely predictor of this, if not a definition--you're probably in the slim minority (good job). And 2. If you're a beta, you may have your work cut out for you seeing as alphas are only the top 6 percent of men.

TRP can serve both groups by providing the information necessary for betas to mimic and perhaps eventually become alphas and for alphas to maximize and streamline their strengths to squeeze the most value out of the sexual marketplace.

As a rule it is the nature of women to use men for protection, resources, and, in the case of her interaction with alpha-males, reproduction. This is due in large part to their physical vulnerabilities. Manipulation is an imperfect word to use to describe this mechanism because it presupposes a degree of maliciousness or intentional deception but it's useful in that it reminds us of how tricky women instinctively are with respect to the value they advertise versus what they provide in an interaction pattern not deliberately calibrated by a more-manipulative, intelligent, and self-interested male. Arthur Schopenhauer described the innate modus operandi of women in these words:

> With girls, Nature has had in view what is called in a dramatic sense a “striking effect,” for she endows them for a few years with a richness of beauty and a, fullness of charm at the expense of the rest of their lives; so that they may during these years ensnare the fantasy of a man to such a degree as to make him rush into taking the honorable care of them, in some kind of form, for a lifetime—a step which would not seem sufficiently justified if he only considered the matter.

Because women are more dependent on men for survival than visa versa, they have collectively developed a compensatory characteristic which allows them to extract value from beta males in ways that are not mutually beneficial. This is manifest in an automatic and brilliant instinct for interpersonal negotiation where she will constantly test the nature of the relationship in the hopes of extracting more value from a man while reducing the value she must provide to him. The classic example of this is the cheating housewife that—if we're all honest—don't blame once we see how beta the husband is (and because sexual strategy is amoral anyway). Women in this respect are instinctively significantly better at sexual strategy than men are. Therefore, we need our own compensatory characteristic: this subreddit.

Much chatter in the manosphere regarding the unpleasant nature of women is only accurate when describing the interaction patterns of women with men who haven't learned female nature and how to consciously manipulate it so as to tip the balance of power in his favor. To quote from a second and superior German philosopher:

> The true man wants two things: danger and play. For that reason he wants woman, as the most dangerous plaything.

Dangerous playthings require skills to enjoy without getting cut or burned. Let's discuss a couple of them here.

##1. Develop and/or mimic a sex-satisfied, not a sex-desiring, mental disposition.

Women don't consciously agree with this but their psychological firmware nevertheless insists on being attracted to men who are already getting laid. This is a very primal form of pre-selection as her mind conducts this subconscious logical syllogism: ""I don't know whether this man is fit for reproduction but the fact that there are signs that he may be already getting laid (he's not desperate, he's barely trying, he's already happy and cheerful) would suggest that other women have already made the assessment that he is.""

There are two differing and mutually compatible ways of cultivating this sex-satisfied state (abundance mentality). One is to actually induce it by having sex with women regularly, going as low on the SMV totem pole as is needed to get laid. The other is to mimic it by artificially altering your behavior and demeanor to match the patterns of someone who *is* getting laid. There is no shame in this: Just avoid like the plague any behavior that she could identify as needy, desperate, or sexually frustrated. This requires you to constantly watch yourself, which is exhausting, so I don't recommend adopting this 2nd technique exclusively.

Heartiste illustrated this point well when he said (paraphrased) ""When you don't know what to say to a woman, imagine that you're already lying in bed with two of them.""

There is a lot to be gained by haggling your way down in the sexual marketplace just so you can be getting laid regularly. I am open to the idea that other male personality types might prefer to not have sex at all than to have sex with a low-SMV female but I would argue that that preference is born of low testosterone or an over-reliance on masturbation and pornography. There appear to be two camps in TRP. One says ""fuck women"" and the other says ""fuck women."" I am of the latter.

##2. Treat her as if she was born to serve you.

The most attractive combination of psychological traits in a man are narcissism and happiness. The latter has some overlap with our discussion about sex-satiety but the former is separate.

Narcissism for our purposes here is delusional self-confidence and reckless self-interest. It's the characteristic of a man who has massive double-standards regarding himself versus the women he dates, and he knows it, and he laughs when he's called out on it.

Developing a specific, strategically deployable form of narcissism with respect to the opposite sex is tricky and every man will integrate this property into their existing social personality differently, but one trick I've found useful is to use a sort of affirmation or article of faith to undo and rewire the beta programming that the mind uses when interacting with women. An anonymous comment in the manosphere once described it this way: ""Act like you are the star of the #1 reality show of all time: cameras following you around and millions watching it because you are so damn interesting.""

In short, brainwash yourself into believing that you're a god. Eventually you may learn that this lie is actually true.

Learned-narcissism mirrors pre-selection closely. In pre-selection a woman doesn't have enough information to know whether you are fit for reproduction so she uses the judgments of *other women* to make that evaluation. With narcissism and delusional self-confidence, a woman doesn't have enough information to know whether you are fit for reproduction so she uses the judgment that *you* have made about yourself to make that evaluation. I assume it goes without saying that a woman isn't consciously considering you as a reproductive mate when she's discovering whether she wants to fuck you. This is all subconscious psychological phenomena that she herself has no direct awareness of. All she consciously experiences is a desire to fuck you.

While betas exist to serve women, women exist to serve alphas. Sometimes this dynamic is subtle; othertimes women will explicitly enjoy being or feeling used up by their alpha male partners. Treat her a little bit like she exists to serve you to establish the desired alpha-to-female relationship pattern.

##3. Ignore anything and everything she says that you would have preferred she didn't say.

The most efficient *and benevolent* method of extracting the desired value out of the interactions you have with females is to punish and reward her by giving and withdrawing your attention. Counter-intuitively, ignoring a woman when she acts or speaks in an undesired way is more effective in disincentivizing than is confronting her verbally or even using physical violence. This is because ignoring a woman communicates a greater readiness to withdraw from her permanently. This demonstrates value and instills insecurity in her; whereas verbal confrontation communicates to her that she is his only option and that he's more inclined to try to control her than he is to merely gravitate away from negativity and undesired behavior and in the direction of other females from whom he knows he can procure a preferable relationship.

If a girl you're interacting with asks an unwanted question or makes an unwanted statement, flatly ignore it. I'm not suggesting that you fold your arms like a frustrated kid and give her the silent treatment. I am suggesting that you literally act exactly as if she had not said it at all. This is frame-reaffirmation. It's the most effective and efficient way of dealing with her bullshit and is especially preferable to verbal confrontation if either of you are prone to the slippy slope of escalating negative emotions.

There is a recurring and compelling sentiment here that the sexual marketplace is a zero-sum game. I believe this is only the case when men fail to learn how to calibrate male-female interaction patterns to satisfy the self-interested nature of the male and the alpha-pleasing instincts of the female—instead of the self-interested nature of the female and the female-pleasing instincts of the male.",968,4.0,0.3370000123977661,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

Tried to re-post at relationships and they deleted it instantly. No reason provided.

Apparently, the fact that my story resonated with so many people is threatening in some way. Threatening to whom, I'll leave you to decide.

So I'm reposting here. Enjoy.

I was in the US Army. I was stationed in South Korea and I met a girl while I was back home on leave visiting friends. She was really cute and I liked her a lot. We clicked instantly. She opened up to me about how her dad had raped her when she was 9. My heart went out to her and we kept in touch for several months even after I left to go back to Korea. A relationship blossomed and we eventually ended up married. A year later, she was pregnant. I was overjoyed. We both were. 9 months later, my son was born. Within a couple months of his birth, the new-baby joyous haze had faded and postpartum depression set in with my wife. I did what I could to help lift her spirits but I was also working 12-hour days and sometimes weekends because, ya know... it's the Army. When my son was 6 months old, I got the news that my unit was going to deploy to Iraq. We were sent to the Fort Irwin National Training Center in the Mojave desert to train. While I was there, I got a call from a friend back at my unit. He had seen my wife in a Military Police vehicle with my son.

I was shattered. I was thousands of miles away and powerless to do anything and didn't know what was wrong or what might have happened to her and my son. I knew she had been in a fragile state. What could be wrong?!? I was absolutely frantic for days. She wasn't answering her phone. Worse yet, we were doing training exercises and I had lost my phone charger at some point and my phone had died. I called again from a friend's phone and left a voicemail with his phone number in the hopes that she would call back. Finally, on day 3 after hearing this news, she calls his phone. He runs over to me and brings me his cell. The wind is blasting sand into my face and it's 110 degrees outside. I ask her what's wrong and what the hell happened?!?

She tells me she wants a divorce... I'm dumbfounded. This is out of nowhere and I'm in total shock. Turns out she wasn't in a Military Police vehicle because there she was in trouble... She was fucking the MP. Of course, she couldn't very well leave my months-old son by himself so she was carting him along with her while she was doing it. It had been going on for months, even before I left. There's pictures of her and him and baby son with a tent in the background. They'd gone camping. Asked her where my son had slept and she matter-of-factly stated that he'd been in the tent with them. Nevertheless, I try to work things out for the sake of our son, but she's adamant and wants the divorce. Divorces are never quick so some tense months went by... but finally the divorce is granted. The next morning, I wake up and she is gone. She left our son with me, got on a plane, she's gone.

So there I was, a 22-year-old soldier who is suddenly a single dad of a now 10-month-old baby and I'm supposed to get on a plane to Iraq the following week. I didn't know what to do. So I grab my son, put him in his car seat, and drive to my unit's headquarters and sit down with my Commander and explain the situation. My son's mother has left and gone back to her parent's house, my own parents both work full-time along with parenting my mentally handicapped sister and can't possibly take on my son as well. So my CO says he'll have to consult with the Battalion Commander about what to do.

I nervously wait a few days. Then, 6 days before we're supposed to deploy to Iraq, my CO comes back and tells me that they're going to put me out of the Army on an honorable discharge. In a way, I was relieved because my son was my first priority. But I also have never felt that guilty in my entire life. I had trained with these guys in my unit for years preparing to go to war. Now I'm not going at all. I was a sergeant so I had soldiers who were underneath me that got transferred to another squad. I felt like they were being abandoned by me and there was nothing I could do to stop it.

Then, on the day my unit is leaving, my company is getting on the buses to drive to the airport. My CO hands me a clipboard and asks me to check off each soldier as they get on the bus. So I did. Each one shook my hand and wished me luck as he got on the bus. I watched every face go by and shook every hand. My CO was the last on the bus. He took the clipboard from me, I saluted him, and he shook my hand and got on the bus and they drove away. Suddenly, I was standing in front of the headquarters building with my son napping in his carrier on the pavement beside me and I was totally and utterly alone. I sat down on the pavement and (I have to sit my manhood aside here for a moment) cried harder than I have ever cried in my entire life. I had never felt so painfully guilty and so alone.

Three months later, I was honorably discharged from the Army and on my way home. I got myself a place, got set up with a community college and started pursuing a degree while doing the single dad thing. I was recovering and putting my life together because I had to. For him.

Three months into this new life I'd set up for myself, a sheriff's deputy shows up at my front door. He hands me a manila envelope with court papers in it. I'd been served. My ex-wife was suing for custody.

Now, let's pause for a moment. So far, all of this is a rather unfortunate set of circumstances and you're probably wondering ""So where's the FU? This doesn't sound like it's your fault."" Up until now, you'd be right. So here it is. Here's where I fucked up: For the first month, I didn't even get a lawyer. I just called her and asked her what in the world she was doing. Couldn't we work this out? Fuck-up number 1. Always get a lawyer if you get a damn court summons. No exceptions. Your lawyer needs time to prepare your case. The longer you take to get one, the more ill-prepared he/she is. So finally I figure this out because things just aren't getting worked out. So I get a lawyer. The lawyer of course tells me to cease communication with her and that all communication will now go through him to her lawyer. But, in my hubris, I did not listen. I called her due to my emotional state being so out of whack. The conversation was somewhat peaceable at first but turned sour. At some point, she asked me if I had firearms in my house. I responded that of course I did to protect our son she abandoned and blah blah blah... This is fuck-up #2. She recorded it. This recording was the central piece of evidence she used in court against me. Of course the gun was locked up but she claimed he was in danger. Never ever disobey your lawyer and never base legal decisions on emotion.

Another six months passed and then a judge awarded sole physical custody of my son to my ex-wife despite the fact that I had been taking care of him alone this entire time since she left us both. This sounds crazy, I know. However, we're talking about a southern bible belt judge who was golf buddies with my ex-father-in-law. So yeah... that was that. While the system is a bit of joke when it comes to father's rights, I ultimately lost my son because I fucked up.

TL;DR - Guy in army gets cheated on by his wife and loses his wife, then his career, and then, due to his own hubris, his son.

Moments later, I had the loudmouth bitch in the principal's office, and returned to my class to discover that, true to form, at least one of the students had managed to get all of this on a camera phone. Meanwhile, the student was in the office, texting other students to delete the video and to lie about the way she was behaving. The students were there giving me the play-by-play of every message.

I stopped by after that class to follow up with the principals, and momma has shown up and wants to throw down as well (no father in the picture -- go figure). Based on her daughter claiming that I had assaulted her in class, she proceeded to call the police to try and have me charged with assault. At that point, she was yelling at the police that everything was on video for them to see.

Well, the principal and the cops got their hands on the video, and saw what really went down. The principal got one of the students to provide the text messages of this stupid girl attempting to do her damage control, and the principal said that she would be suspended for a few days, and told me that I could file charges. If I do that, this girl will end up in alternative school for the foreseeable future.

And, you know what? That is exactly what I am going to do. Teenage girls who cry and make up stories to try and get themselves out of trouble grow up to be the kind of woman who will make false rape and abuse allegations in order to get back at men who make them angry. If there had not been hard physical evidence, witnesses, and documentation of what went on in my classroom today, it would have been an issue of ""he said, she said,"" with not only this position, but my entire career on the line. Nothing like a child abuse charge to have one's teaching credentials revoked.

So, tomorrow I am going to formally file charges against this girl and let the legal system have a crack at her. Maybe she will think twice about recklessly lying to her mother, the principal, and the police with tears in her eyes after conducting herself like a complete cunt. And maybe her mother will think twice before calling the cops to complicate a matter that didn't require their attention. Maybe other students who see what happens to her will get the hint that you don't pull that kind of shit without real-world consequences.

Or maybe not. Regardless, I am going to thoroughly enjoy giving this stupid girl a taste of her own medicine!
 

UPDATE 3/24: Met with principal, the girl, and her mother today. Girl is still maintaining her lies, and mother thinks we should both apologize to each other. Yeah, no. I told the principal to go forward with the charges.  Plus, she has her best friend lying for her, saying that she was the one who sent the messages to cover things up, not her. 

UPDATE 4/17: Sorry for the delay in the update. The police officer on campus was reluctant to file it as an assault (shocking, right?), but she in the interim she actually got herself in more trouble for jumping another girl on campus, so she's off to alternative placement anyway.

There were two positive results from this: by maintaining my frame throughout this whole thing, she was made out to be a fool by the other students on campus, as well as her mother. Momma was actually calling some of the other students in the class to try and get them to change their stories -- so much so, that one of the student reported that she had to block the number from her phone.

The second is that students (in my class, at least) better understand that I am not to be fucked with now.",970,4.0,0.3197000026702881,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

#Tired of seeing posts on here shitting all over Tinder. If you do it right there is no easier way to meet women in my opinion. The ones shitting on it are the ones not having any success. I've been successful at Tinder(and Bumble) for the past couple of years and let me show you how I do it. 

I know a lot of Tinder guides have been posted here before, but here is my take on how to have success.

-----------

#Step 0 - Understand The Ultimate Maxim of Tinder

**IF YOU ARE NOT GETTING MATCHES, ITS BECAUSE YOUR PICTURES SUCK.** 100% of the time this is the case. It's not Tinder screwing you, its not Tinder trying to get you to pay for its Plus/Gold features, its not shallow women, its not women only on there for validation, its not a glitch, its not anything but the fact that your pictures are ass. Keep this in mind when you inevitably see someone shit on Tinder in the comments of this post or elsewhere on TRP. 

-------

#Step 1 - Understand The Tinder ELO System and how it works

Basically Tinder uses an ELO rating system to ""rate"" each account to judge how attractive the account is based on their swiping and how they get swiped. Obviously, if your profile gets swiped right a lot, you'll have a higher rating, and vice versa. It's not just how people swipe you that determines your rating, but also how picky you are. If you are swiping right on everything, your rating will go down because when you do that you are swiping right on low rated profiles. If you are pickier and only swipe right on higher rated profiles, you'll have a chance for a better score, assuming you are getting swiped right a lot as well. To learn more about how the ELO rating system works mathematically, check out http://archive.is/O07Ad

**TLDR, your Tinder ELO score is determined on the rating/quality of profiles swiping right on you, and the rating/quality of profiles you are swiping right on.**

--------

#Step 2 - Know your competition

One thing I recommend doing, if you have the time, is creating a burner Facebook account as a woman. Use it to make a Tinder account and select that you are interested in men. This way you can scroll through the profiles to see the men you will be competing with in your area. 

A general theory of Tinder is that for brand new accounts, you get a ""noob boost"", which means they are going to show you the higher ELO rated Tinder accounts first, and your profile will also be put toward the top of other user's stacks so they don't have to scroll through many profiles before seeing yours. This doesn't mean every single Tinder account in your stack that you scroll through will be high rated, because remember, there will also be new accounts in your initial stack who are also being boosted, many of which will suck.

Why am I mentioning this noob boost? Because you can use this to scout your competition. The profiles you will be seeing when you do this are generally the profiles the attractive women will be seeing. That way you know what you need to do to beat the competition. 

For the sake of this post I went ahead and did this for my area(medium sized city in the Southern United States). I scrolled through the first 100 male profiles and gave each profile a rating on picture quality(1 being shit, 5 being top tier) and attractiveness(1 being ugly, 5 being top tier) and then I flagged an account if they were not lean.

Settings: Age 18-32, 30 mile radius.

Results: 

* Of the 100 profiles, only 3 of them had what I considered top tier pictures. Most were shitty selfies, bad quality pictures that had grainy or fuzziness in them, bad lighting, or bad poses. Lots of crappy gym selfies and mirror selfies. The average picture quality rating was 1.866 out of 5. That's bad, and shows you don't really need to do much to have better pictures than the rest.

* The average attractiveness rating was a 2.1, not much higher than the picture quality number. And this is supposedly contains the best profiles? I think a lot of the profiles I saw were ""noob boost"" profiles, no way they would be high rated. Either way, I only handed out a ""5"" to 4 profiles, that's 4%, and only handed out a 4 to 3 profiles. That means out of 100, only 7 were what I considered attractive enough profiles a woman would swipe right on.

* 65 of the 100 profiles were not lean, 51 were overweight, and 32 were obese. Once again, shows how much impact being lean has. 

* Average age was 20.9, but the average age of the profiles I gave a 3 or higher to was 24.6. Older guys seem to have a better grasp on this.

**Moral of this story? You really don't have a high bar to clear when it comes to having a top tier Tinder profile. Most guys Tinder profiles suck ass. All you need are good quality photos and to be lean to beat most Tinder profiles out there. Unless Tinder only shows the highest rated accounts to accounts who already have a proven high ELO score and still hides them even from noob boost accounts.**

--------

#Step 3 - Yes, being attractive matters

This is an app where people judge you on apperance. You think looks don't matter? They absolutely do. I am not saying this app is worthless for you if you are below a 7/10 in looks, but you have to reel in your expectations. Women on these apps are pickier than they are in real life, so if you are a 5/10, don't go in expecting to match with 8s or higher. 

Before dismissing Tinder and other apps all together, try to max out your looks first. Lose weight, get lean, lift, dress well, wear the right accessories, sport a good haircut/hairstyle, have a good facial care/skin care routine, and all of that. Doing all of this + taking good pictures will go a long way and can add points to your attractiveness. 

----------

#Step 4 - Pictures are 90% of the battle

I repeat the Ultimate Tinder Maxim: **IF YOU ARE NOT GETTING MATCHES, YOU HAVE BAD PICTURES. PERIOD.**

You are going to sink or swim by your pictures, specifically, the quality of your pictures. Period. I consider myself an attractive man, but I failed at Tinder at first because my pictures sucked. Even if you are attractive, if you have shitty pictures, you are doomed. When I finally put some good pictures on my profile, it was night and day the number of matches and interest I was getting. It became like shooting fish in a barrel. I even got reported to Tinder as a catfish because women thought I was ripping my pictures from models and wasn't who I was in the pictures. 

Now the term ""good pictures"" can mean so many different things. From my experience, here are the elements that make up good quality pictures:

* Picture quality - There is a difference between a shitty cell phone front camera picture and a picture coming from a DSLR or expensive camera. This does matter. Front facing cell phone cameras generally have bad quality, bad apertures, bad lenses, and distort your face. The clearer and less grainy the picture, the better. 

* Lighting - Lighting matters. Pictures taken in the dark will suck because they will have high ISO settings, meaning more grainy. Pictures taken using indoor lighting often cast unnatural shadows with harsher lighting. Pictures taken with a camera flash add 7 years to your face and create all kinds of bad shadows and unappealing flashback. The best lighting is outdoors. The problem with outdoor photos is that generally the sun will be too bright, causing too many harsh shadows, overexposure and your eyes to squint. One solution is to take pictures when its cloudy. Or you can take pictures in the shade(but beware of surrounding glare that causes you to squint). The best time to take outdoor pictures is an hour after sunrise or before sunset, known as the golden hour. You can google ""Golden Hour Calculator"" to determine what time exactly this is for your location. During the golden hour you can take good pictures with soft, golden lighting and yet its not bright enough to cast bad shadows or make you squint. If you are wearing sunglasses it doesn't matter what time of day you take outdoor pics, but generally you don't want to have more than 1 or 2 pics in your Tinder picture album with sunglasses.

* Setting - Where you take your pictures matter. A computer selfie at your desk in your room = shit. A picture of you outdoors somewhere interesting = good. The key here is variety. When I was doing the burner account competition check earlier, most guys are bad when it comes to variety of their settings. Find unique outdoor places to go to. One of my favorite is the roof of a parking garage downtown on weekends. There is no one up there, I don't have to pay to get in, and you get a badass view of the downtown skyline in the background. Parks, hiking trails, mountains, lakes, beaches, rivers, etc. all work. You can also be creative and get shots on the sidewalks, streets, etc. 

* Pose and Posture - You want your poses to be natural based on the setting your picture is taken. If you are taking a picture on a sidewalk, you obviously don't want your pose to be as if you are posing for the camera, you want your pose to be as if you were walking down the sidewalk. Go to YouTube and look up modeling poses for inspiration. And make sure to have good posture whatever pose you use.

* Facial Expression - The key here is variety. You don't want all your photos to be of you smiling into the camera. You don't want all of your photos to be of you looking away from the camera with your mouth closed and a serious expression. I go with the rule of halves here. You want half of your pictures to be smiling, half not smiling. Then half of your pictures looking into the camera, and half looking away. 

* Composition - Where you are placed in the frame matters a lot. You see a lot of guys fail at this when checking out the competition. In my opinion there are only 2 acceptable compositions: Half body shots, and full body shots. Half body shots are generally shots from the waist or upper thigh up, full body has your entire body in the frame. But that is only half the battle - you don't want much open space between the top and bottom of the frame. Use the entire frame. [This is a good example of what I mean in a full body shot, the concept for a half body shot is the same.](http://www.elevatephotography.co.uk/image-view/whole-body-shot) Notice how the whole frame is used, not much gap above his head or below his shoes. [Now here is an example of a bad full body shot - notice how much empty space there is above his head and below his feet.](http://www.photo4design.com/stock-photo-full-body-shot-of-teenage-guy-66071) You want to avoid face only shots because they just aren't flattering and will hide your body, which you want to show off if you are lean, and also hides your fashion, which leads me to: 

*  Fashion/Style - Your clothing choices matter and can greatly enhance your overall look if done right. You want your pictures to show off a diverse variety of well fitting stylish clothes. FIT is the key, more than style. They both greatly matter, but bad fit will ruin any style. A good style can't overcome bad fit. Go shopping to stores like J Crew and wear the smallest size you can that still fits, in a slim style cut if you can find it. Some good ideas for clothes to wear: Dark Wash Slim Jeans, Slim Chino Pants(Khaki is my favorite color), Flat Front Chino Shorts at 9 inch inseam or less, Slim Fit Casual Button Down Shirts, Polos, Well Fitting T-Shirts, Denim Button Downs, Denim Jackets, Bomber Jackets, Leather Jackets, Slim Dress Shirts, Nice Sweaters, Watches(you need to wear one in every photo), boots, dress shoes, loafers, nice sneakers, necklaces, pendants, and bracelets. NO - Cargo Shorts, Cargo Pants, tennis shoes, basketball shoes, ""skater"" shoes, flip flops/sandals, baggy clothes, hats, sweats, hoodies, logo or graphic shirts. You need to be wearing a wristwatch in all your pictures.

* Hair - Make sure you put some effort into it, whatever you do. Find a good haircut/hairstyle for your face shape. 

* Pets - If you have a dog, probably a good idea to have a dog pic. 

* Motorcycle - If you have one, probably a good idea to have a pic of you on your bike

----------

#Step 5 - How to actually go about taking good pictures

So I stated what makes a good picture. But how do you actually do it? There are 3 ways I recommend, all of which are viable and have their pros and cons.

**The Friend With a Camera Approach**

Find a friend to go along with you with a camera and have him/her take pictures of you in various places or settings. Ideally you'll want a friend with a good camera who knows a thing or two about how to take good pictures. Or you could go on Craigslist or something and hire a professional photographer but that can be a bit pricey.

Pros: Lots of possibilities, someone else controlling the camera means you don't have to set and forget the photo settings or placement, good for getting shots at busy places with lots of people without creating a distraction or scene(think downtown locations), cheapest approach

Cons: Less creative control over the pictures, can only be done when friend is available and in that certain time frame, not everyone has a friend who is available or willing to do this. 

**The Tripod Approach**

This is where you buy a tripod to go with whatever camera you are using, set up the tripod and take pictures. I do have a nice camera and a tripod, and have used this approach, but it can be difficult to get right even though I have a remote controller for it because with nicer cameras, it's most ideal to have someone behind the camera to fine tune the controls for every shot.

Pros: Don't need someone else, can do everything on your own time, allows for unique locations to be shot

Cons: Can be expensive, not ideal for high traffic places, tripod can be unstable and knocked over by things like wind, some locations there isn't an ideal place to put the tripod, even with a timer or remote controller it can be difficult to get the right photo settings in terms of shutter speed, aperture and focus

**The Drone Approach**

This is personally the approach I have used over the past year to amazing results. Obviously, drones aren't cheap, but they are worth the investment. Not only can you get some good photos from some unique angles and take them anywhere, but it also gives you a fun hobby as well on the side. I've used both the DJI Spark and DJI Mavic Air drone for this. Both have good cameras, and even better, they have an interval setting meaning it will take a picture every 2 seconds. Meaning 30 pictures a minute. DJI Spark battery lasts about 12 minutes, and DJI Mavic Air lasts about 16-18 minutes. That means you can get 360-480 pictures per battery. Tell me you can't find at least one good picture? You can find a DJI Spark new for $350-$400 in stores or on eBay used for cheaper. Just make sure you get a quality drone, DJI is a good brand. The cheap $50-$100 drones you can get at Wal-Mart won't cut it. 

Pros: Don't need another person, can get all kinds of unique angles/settings/locations you can't get with a tripod, can be controlled remotely, good picture quality once you get the settings right

Cons: Loud, not ideal at all for use amongst places with a lot of traffic/people so you have to find more isolated places, some locations are restricted for drone use, takes a while to learn how to dial in the photo settings like ISO, shutter speed and exposure value that flatter you the most, expensive

**All 3 of these approaches are viable. But one of these 3 approaches have to be used if you want to have top tier photos. Getting your cell phone camera, leaning it up against something, setting the timer and running into place isn't going to cut it. Outstretched arm selfies won't cut it. Cropped group pics won't cut it. Mirror pics won't cut it. Yes, it takes time and effort, and for some of the approaches, investment, but it pays off. Do you want to succeed or not?**

-------

#Step 6 - To shirtless ab pic or not to shirtless ab pic?

From my experience, you can go either way. If you have a shitty body, are skinny or fat, and have no defined abs and vascularity, it won't work. If you have a good body with defined muscles, vein vascularity and a 6 pack, it won't hurt to have a shirtless picture in there. It's not always ideal, though. There *are* girls who will swipe left when they see a shirtless picture no matter what. I've found that shirtless pics work better when you are looking for hookups, not so much when you are looking for dating/something longer term. 

If you want to use a shirtless pic, there is one rule: **IT HAS TO LOOK CANDID.** Shirtless mirror bathroom pic = NO. Shirtless gym selfie = NO. If it looks like you are posing for the picture, and therefore it was planned, its not going to work. It has to look like it was taken candidly, unplanned, as if you were doing something, and someone happened to take a picture of you. The shirtless picture I had the most success with was one of me at the park holding a football, I made it look like I was playing football, even though I was there by myself and used my drone to take the picture. However, I made it come across as extremely candid, even though my 6 pack and vein vascularity and muscles were showing off. Shirtless pics at the beach or pool also work. 

---------

#Step 7 - Post Processing/Editing

You don't want to just use the pictures as they are. You want to find your best ones and then edit them. Use editing software(Adobe Lightroom is good, the stock Windows photo software is good, I am sure iPhoto is good) to mess around with the pictures. Apply filters, change the brightness/contrast/clarity/saturation, and all of that. The key is to not go overboard with the filters and everything. You still want it to look natural. The editing will add to your photo, not make your photo. Women will know if your picture is edited too much. Edit it in a way where it looks a lot better than the original, but at the same time you can't tell it was actually edited. 

---------

#Step 8 - Selecting Which Pictures to Use

The generally key, as I have already stated, is variety. You want your 6 pictures to give a well rounded perspective of who you are.  Variety in terms of poses, facial expressions, outfits, and locations. 

Obviously you want to pick your 6 most flattering pictures. The best approach to use is to pick 6 locations and outfits and take a shit ton of pictures at all 6. Then pick the best from each group and there are your 6. 

Your lead picture needs to be your best one. It needs to clearly show your face and your body, uncovered eyes(no sunglasses) with clothes on(no shirtless pics as your lead), by yourself(no group pics). Your last picture also needs to be a good one, as if a girl is swiping through your pics, will be her last impression before she decides to swipe right or left on you. Remember, she will judge you by your worst pic. 

I'm not going to post my profile, but here is a breakdown of my pictures:

* 4 of 6 I am smiling

* 3 of 6 I am looking at the camera

* 2 of 6 I am wearing sunglasses

* 5 of 6 are full body shots, head to toe

* All are taken outside

* No shirtless pics that I am currently using

* 2 of 6 I am wearing flat front chino shorts, 2 of 6 I am wearing jeans, 1 of 6 I am wearing khaki chinos, 1 of 6 I am wearing dress pants

* 2 of 6 I am wearing a v neck t-shirt, 3 of 6 I am wearing a casual button down shirt with the sleeves rolled up, 1 of 6 I am wearing a dress shirt with a tie

* 2 of 6 were taken in broad daylight(both sunglasses pics), 3 of 6 taken at sunset in the golden hour, 1 of 6 taken in broad daylight but in the shade

* Locations Used: Beach Sand, Downtown Sidewalk, Work(Outside), Top Level of Downtown Parking Garage, Football Field, Side of Building

* Poses Used: Sitting on Cooler, Leaning Against Pole, Leaning Against Wall, Walking With Football in Hand, Standing Straight Up Smiling Into the Camera, Looking Over Shoulder

* No Group Pics or pics with others. Group pics are overrated. Yes, it shows you having fun with friends, but generally they are not flattering and the cropping you have to do ruins the quality. I'd rather have 100% control over my pictures from start to finish. If your pictures are good enough she won't give a shit if you are alone in all of them. 

----------

#Step 9 - Your bio. Does it even matter?

In general, your bio doesn't matter. She really only looks at your pictures which are all that matter. If your pictures are good enough, then she might glance at your profile just to make sure you are a real person. 

Your bio will not help you at all. It can only hurt you. Since you have all to lose and nothing to gain, you need to keep your bio short and to the point. If you are over 6 feet tall, list your height. If you are 5'10, say you are 6 feet. Put where you are from, what part of town you live in, and about 3 or 4 things you like to do. Put the college you graduated from if you have graduated. If you have a cool job, put it in there, otherwise be either really vague with it or don't put it in there at all.

Example Profile that works: ""6'1, from New York, living here in Florida in West Miami. Ohio State '13. Fishing, traveling, fitness, and more.""

There. That's all you really need. Nothing in there that will scare anyone away or devalue you, but makes you look like a real person. Don't try to put anything witty or funny or out there. Just keep it simple. 

----------

#Step 10 - Deploying your Profile and Using Tinder

Don't set up your profile until you are absolutely ready to start with your full profile because once you set up your profile you are put in others stacks. If you already have an account, delete it so you can start over. Upload your pictures, write your bio, and where you go from here is up to you.

**Swiping**

Be picky. Only swipe right on girls that you are certain are who they are in their profile. If she only has face shots, chances are she is fat. Remember the rule: ""If you got it, flaunt it"". Girls live by this. If they have a good body, they will show it off. If they have good tits or ass, it will be shown off. If it looks like they are hiding something, they are. Read her profile, don't just look at her pics. Chances are you might like her pics, but then you look at her profile and it will state she is a single mom. Generally, if you have been swiping a while and have reached the point of the stack where all the girls are ugly, and then you come across one that is hot, chances are she is either a bot or single mom. Because legit hot girls who aren't single moms or don't have major red flags will never be that far down the stack. 

Being picky also helps your ELO score, which increases your chances of being shown at the top of the stacks of the more attractive women. 

**Super Likes**

There are two trains of thought on Super Likes. One train is that its good, it will make her think longer about you. The other train is that its creepy and too much and shows her you are already too interested. 

My take? Use them. I've had more good than bad from super likes. Not only that, but using a Super Like automatically puts you at the top of her stack, so you know you will be seen next time she logs on. Unless you have Tinder Gold, you only get one per day so use wisely. 

**Tinder Gold**

I am a fan. I only recommend, however, using this on a month by month basis. I think its a good investment to use your first month. The queue which shows who has liked you is helpful and will help you gauge how good your pictures are. If its not filling up you have shitty pictures. Also the quality of girls liking you will also help you see what type of women is finding you attractive. Lastly it helps because it helps you ground yourself to reality. A lot of girls don't log into Tinder that much, so by seeing who has already liked you, you won't get your hopes up for girls in the stack who may or may not be active(Tinder hides profiles inactive more than 2 weeks). 

If you are successful at Tinder I think its worth it to stay on Gold after your first month. I do. The passport feature is useful for traveling, as you can arrange meetups with girls before you even get there. This is just my opinion though. If you aren't successful, paying for Gold won't make you successful. The best way I can describe Tinder Gold is that its a valet for an already successful Tinder user, it just makes it easier. Seeing who has already liked you might sound like something you don't really need or need to pay for, and while I agree, its actually been more beneficial than I realized. 

**Boosts**

Regardless of whether or not you subscribe to Gold, I think everyone needs to try a boost at least once. A boost puts you at the top of the stack for everyone in your area for 30 minutes. This means you will be seen by everyone who logs on during that time. I get matches regardless but each time I boost it seems like I get a lot more. Boosts help because after a while, unless your ELO score is good, you fall farther and farther down the stacks of other girls Tinder stacks, and you won't be seen. Instead all she will see are high ELO accounts and new accounts getting their noob boost. Women swipe a lot less profiles than men do(since the attractive ones will match with almost everyone they swipe right on) so its vital to make sure you are showing up at the top of stacks. 

Timing is important with boosts. From my experience, Wednesday at 7:15pm is the best time to use it. This is ideal because its before the weekend before plans are set. If you use it on Friday or Saturday girls already have plans. 

You get a free boost every month if you have gold, otherwise its $4 each.

**Bots**

Obvious bot accounts are obvious. Their pictures are often cropped and low quality but of really attractive women in generic poses/settings. Their bios are often empty or extremely generic. And they often only have either 1, 3 or 4 pictures exactly. They are pretty easy to spot. 

**Instagram/Snapchat Follower Farmers, Sugar Daddy Seekers and Venmo Scams**

You'll see girls on here who are clearly only doing it to rope in instagram/snapchat followers, or find a sugar daddy, or get money sent to them via Venmo. 

Here is my take on them. Yes, that is what they are doing. However, for the right guy, they will throw that away. Use the Brad Pitt test here. If she saw Brad Pitt had matched with her on Tinder, you think she would just try to use him for Venmo money or to get an Instagram follow out of him? No way. 

If you think you are attractive enough, go for it anyway. Generally these girls obviously fishing for Instagram Followers or Venmo money should be massive red flags automatically disqualifying them from anything above plate material, but its possible to bust through the massive shit test. I've done it multiple times. 

-----------

#Step 11 - You've matched, now what?

So you have matched. Ideally with multiple women. 

As successful as I am at this, I would still say only about 10% of women message me first(and many women who message you first will be bots if you were unable to detect them prior to swiping). You are going to have to do the initiation. 

Fuck that shit about message timing, when to message her, etc. ""If I message her too soon after matching she will think I am desperate!"" No. Just message her when you feel like it. 

The key to an opener is to be different, set the frame, use her name, and play on her emotions. I've watched girls use tinder before and pretty much every guy either opens them with a boring ""Hey"" or ""Hi"", or uses some really stupid cheesy pick up or sexual opener that is just awkward. None of that is different, none of it sets the frame in the guy's court, and none of it plays on her emotions in a positive way.

It has to be organic. Review her profile and pictures, and try to craft a message based on that. Don't compliment her physically(i.e. you're hot or you're cute), don't get sexual in the first message, or use a dumb pick up line. 

Here is an example I used recently that worked. It was a profile of a nurse who said she worked the overnight shift and lets say her name was Anna.

>""Anna, are you a Waffle House or IHOP kind of girl? Since I am guessing those are the 2 places I would have to choose from to take you with that schedule...""

See what I did here? I did a lot of things. I set the frame as one that I will be taking her out(not necessarily to Waffle House or IHOP). I crafted the message organically based on her profile, and I made her laugh with the Waffle House/IHOP reference since those places are pretty sketchy in the AM hours, but people secretly love those places. I also gave her a reason to respond.

Here is another example of a girl who had a picture of her bowling, lets say her name was Tina:

>""Tina, if we go on a bowling date, I am not letting you use the bumpers, so you better learn how to bowl without them""

Again, I set the frame from the first message to one that I would be taking her out without asking her out. I teased her about her bowling skills and gave her a reason to respond(to defend her bowling skills). We did go on a bowling date when all was said and done. 

**It's a numbers game**

You are going to have girls who don't respond. You are going to have girls who unmatch. You are going to have girls who take forever to respond. You are going to have girls who are just not into it even if they respond. It's really a numbers game. The more girls you open, the better chances you have at least one who goes through with it all. Don't get hung up on any one girl. Assume every girl you match with will ghost you. Assume every girl you talk to will eventually stop. Assume every girl who gives you her number and you set up a date/meet with will flake. Don't get invested. Persistence is the key. 

I think this is where most guys get discouraged and come here to write their **OMG TINDER IS SHIT** posts. They have shitty pics, and only match with 1 or 2 girls, have no abundance, and when it doesn't work out with those 1 or 2 girls whether they don't respond, stop responding, flake, etc. they act like Tinder is shit and all women on there are shit. You have to remain persistent. Keep in mind the better you look, the better your pics are, the more attractive you are and better your text game is, the less likely she will flake, and the more likely she will respond and follow through. I can attest to that. Remember that girls have dozens of matches and are only going to bother with their best ones. 

---------

#Step 12 - When to ask for her number/ask her out?

So you have had a successful opener and started a conversation. When do you escalate to get her number or arrange a date/meet up?

Every girl is different, from what I have learned, so there is no one size fits all plan. Some girls want more rapport and chit chat before they are comfortable giving you their number or setting up a date. Others require less. Regardless, you need to at least try to get a number or set up a date in 5-6 messages or less. Remember, she has dozens of matches, with guys who are farther along the process than you probably are, so you have to shit or get off the pot eventually. Plus she will get bored if you don't go after what you want. 

The best way to do it is to have the conversation naturally flow into you asking for her number or asking her out. Here is an example that I used, of a girl who actually messaged me first:

>Her: Hey! How was your weekend?

>Me: Pretty good. You?

>Her: Nothing too exciting lol. Lots of work.

>Me: Well we need to fix the nothing too exciting part. Let's go get some drinks, when are you free

See how I took her response and turned it into escalation. You already have the IOI, otherwise you wouldn't have matched, so why waste time? I did it on message #2. You need to look for the opening to make it flow naturally to asking for her number or asking her out. Sometimes that takes longer than 2 messages, but you get the idea. You don't want to go too early though, then you just come across as a player/needy/desperate. 

The worst thing you can do is just make her your pen pal and ask dozens of interview style questions without escalating. She is not an idiot, she knows what you are there for. If after 5-6 messages or so you still haven't found the opening to ask for her number or ask her out, just do it. 

---------

#Step 13 - So you've got her number and set up a date, now what?

Try to set up a date within 1-3 days of getting her number/asking her out. Anything longer she will probably flake. The only times I have successfully set up dates longer in advance is when she was out of town. 

From there you need to shut the fuck up and not contact her until the day of the date, where you confirm plans. Don't text her, don't become her penpal. All you can do at this point is hurt yourself. 

If she initiates with you and texts you, respond to be polite, but space out your responses. I'm talking, take 12+ hours to respond. I had a girl who was all over me from the time we set up a date to the time we met up, always texting me. I didn't want to be rude so I would respond, and I thought that since she was the one initiating, I was fine. Wrong. We go out and then after the date she says she ""wasn't feeling a connection"". You'll never live up to the standard you set by texting her. You have nothing to gain and everything to lose. Resist the urge to text her until you meet up. 

If she flakes, she flakes. It happens. Don't become invested. If she is truly interested she will propose a counter time. Just because she cancels doesn't mean she isn't interested. I had one cancel on me and I thought it was over and I needed to move on but she rescheduled with me. 

-----------

#Does this approach also work with Bumble?

Yes. The difference is that she will open you, so you can take her opener and play with it. That doesn't mean its any easier or harder. 

My problem with Bumble is that the userbase is smaller, and there are so many inactive profiles on there. Unlike Tinder, Bumble doesn't remove/hide profiles that are inactive. I was using Bumble and saw the profile of a girl I work with who was married a year ago. She said she hasn't logged on there since 2015. 

Also you will match with girls on Bumble and they still won't message you. Again, girls get tons of matches so they will only message the cream of the crop. Become the cream. 

The upside to Bumble is that the quality of girls are higher. 

-------------

#Conclusion and Final Thoughts

* Tinder/Bumble/Online Dating is 99% pictures. They have to be outstanding. Not good. Not great. Oustanding. How much you want to invest in getting outstanding pictures is ultimately up to you because it takes effort and time and in some cases money. Just remember. If you aren't getting matches, its your pictures. End of discussion. It's not Tinder screwing you over, its not shallow women only looking for validation, its not women having you outside of their Tinder preference settings, its not anything but your shitty ass pictures. 

* Your approach if you are looking for hookups and your approach if you are looking for something more long term has to be different. 

* It really is a numbers game. I know this sounds cliche but the more matches you get the more your odds are in favor of at least one working out. You get more matches by having good pictures and utilizing features like boost. Tinder might seem like a lost cause if you only get 5 matches and none of them work out. But if you have 50 or 500 matches you're going to have matches that work out, its the law of averages. 

* Don't get your hopes up on any one individual girl until you actually meet up with her in person. From there you apply TRP to prevent the onset of oneitis.

* Don't match with a girl unless you are 100% certain she is who she is in her pictures. Read her entire bio and look at all her pics before matching to find red flags. 

* Tinder Gold in my opinion is useful if you are already successful at Tinder, but it won't turn you from unsuccessful to successful. 

* I've seen false advice given around TRP that the opener doesn't matter, if she is attracted to you she is attracted. While attraction does matter the most, you still have to give her a reason to engage with you, invoke her emotions and set the frame. 

* Shit or get off the pot. She has dozens of matches and dozens of guys doing the same thing you are doing. If you don't make a move, another guy will. Build some short rapport and then find an opening to ask for her number/ask her out.

* There is inevitably going to be someone in the comment section saying you don't need Tinder or dating apps, all you need is day/night game, Tinder is shit.

972,7b4whj,"Not only do I see a lot of posts here on this topic, but it is also one of the main statements my friends give me when asking for tips to ""get into shape"". My immediate response to them has now become what I put in the title of this post.


I go to a gym with about 3000 members, probably the biggest one in my city. This particular gym has this stigma for being roid central, as it houses quite a few pro bodybuilders and high end Instagram models, mixed with power-lifters who've been pumping iron since they could walk. Stepping foot inside the building can be a very daunting thing for newcomers as they feel they're immediately placed at the bottom of the ladder. 


Here's the thing though, something that is one of my favorite aspects of joining a gym. Despite what is taught outside the gym walls, once you walk inside, 99.9% of the time ***no one could care less*** about your size, muscle build, appearance, or the level of progress you are at. The only people that will give a shit about you are personal trainers, and that's only because they're paid to. In fact, the only point where most regulars would acknowledge your existence would be their first glance at you, and most of the the time this will consist of them thinking *""Good for them, good to see people trying to improve themselves,""* before they get back to whatever they were training.


Remember, everyone in a gym shares a common goal: to improve *their* fitness. Most are too focused on this goal to even consider for two seconds if you are sharing that goal with them.

Great fucking legal advice! Just what this guy came here for. To hear some armchair neckbeards talk about how his wife is the victim and this idiot goes so far as to saying that he needs to make AMENDS with a potentially hostile woman.

And then there's the classic projection from White Knights, Incels, and SJWs.

I know right? That woman shouldn’t be threatening the father of her children! Oh, wait, you think the woman threatening to kill someone is the victim...because the actual victim dared tell his kids the hard truth when they asked?

Legal advice is a shithole.

And now [here's](http://archive.is/px52X) the original BOLA thread. Another thread filled with classic assumptions. LAOP talks reasonable and is coherent in his tone, he MUST be a narcissistic abuser and manipulating asshole and the wife is a victim! Everyone even going against this is down-voted.

Then OP posts an [update](http://archive.is/2zKAM). He confronts his ex wife in a reasonable manner and offers her a way to repair her relationship with his kids. He even tells them about how he was not the ""best lover"" and that she should be forgiven and that he ""forgives"" her.

[bestoflegaladvice](http://archive.is/BTLaJ) continues to maintain that OP is a psychopath and a manipulative jerk who has ""hurt"" his kids. 

> LAOP is still insufferable. Those poor kids :(

Clearly. The father responds in the thread, presenting himself in an eloquent and organized manner. He even attempts to repair the relationship between his ex and his kids. 

Apparently the kids are ""unlucky"" to have such a caring and kind father. He should have lied to them forever. Lying fixes everything right? 

""I believe I handled this perfectly."" isn't very humble.

Sure, that was cocky. Better call him a sociopath, then!!! Better say that he thinks he's a God!

Like those statement aren't extreme and overly confident in one's abilities to judge character.

>Of course he isn't an angel. What a stupid concept. And he's admitted as much. So why are you castigating him so hard for not being fucking angelic? You've been frothing at the mouth over this guy's story, calling him a monster. Where's your halo?

Downvoted. Why? Because apparently OP is supposed to be this infallible angel and the poor womyn is being oppressed by such a kind father who, supposedly, forgave her cheating and even tried to help her repair her relationship with the kids.

A bit about me, I started 120 lbs & 5'9 soaking wet when I found this sub. My days consisted of smoking weed and playing video games all day when I wasn't working at my shitty dead end job in the food industry. No college, no girlfriends, no social life, just a never ending cycle of wake up depressed, drown it out with weed and video games, staying up til' I couldn't keep my eyes open. Rise and repeat. I could go on in detail, but you already know what I'm going to say cause most of you have been there. 

Now here's where I brag. I quit smoking weed entirely, moved 1000 miles away from my hometown to a coastal city I love, I'm the happiest I've ever been at [180 lbs](https://imgur.com/a/xopC8) with dedicated lifting habits, a great new career with huge potential, and success with girls everywhere I go (5 plates currently spinning with more in the works)

I want this post to be about helping newbies transition from learning all this wisdom and information to **APPLYING IT** Here are the main points that I learned and applied that got me **RESULTS**.

**1. Discipline yourself to take action.**

The most important of all lessons. None of what you read here matters if you don't do anything with it. My best results happened when applied a little knowledge at a time, not trying to overwhelm myself with too much change too quickly. [Baby steps.](https://youtu.be/p3JPa2mvSQ4?t=53s) For example, if your lacking in the fitness department, start with a monday wednesday and friday routine with [5x5 stronglifts](https://stronglifts.com/) for a month, before upping to a 4 day split for 3 months, before upping to a 5 day split for 6 months, before upping to a 6 day split or [PPL](https://www.muscleforlife.com/push-pull-legs/) for a year. Another example, for 2 weeks, just start saying ""Hi"" to people when you walk past them or make eye contact with no expectation of a conversation starting. Then for another 2 weeks start saying, ""Hey, how's it goin?"" again, not expecting any conversation to start. Then 2 more weeks of ""Hey, how's it goin? Crazy game last night, huh?"" This time allowing a 30 second conversation to occur. And so on and so forth. You have to make yourself do the things you know you need to do. You *WILL* thank yourself for this. The grass *IS* greener on the other side of hardship. 

**2. Learn to speak up about what you want and start fucking saying NO.**

This world is your oyster, you're a [legendary sexy space christ sent from mars to lead the normies to a fun and interesting life that doesn't suck.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHi9mKq0slA) Boss wants you to stay an hour late so it fucks up your workout schedule? ""No, can't tonight"". Friends wanna go to some lame ass hipster bar filled with green and pink-haired feminists, ""Fuck that shit bro, we're going bowling."" Friend doesn't wanna approach 2 cuties with you cause he's a pussy? Go approach and bring them over to introduce him anyway. One way or another you have to make this life enjoyable and fun **FOR YOU**. Stop giving a fuck about others intentions and start carrying out your own wants and desires. Others will follow and want to follow. I promise you'll be happier and as a bonus, people will respect you *MORE* for it. It is your mother-fucking job to get out of life what you want from it. Act like a king and go for it.

**3. Be bold, confident, and cocky**

[Is this really all that hard?](https://youtu.be/fIaHxQIvy6o?t=59m30s) Hell no.. and it seems fun as fuck. Who else would have the balls to do that? Certainly not the majority of guys in the world who are feminized pussies. I do ridiculous shit like this often, the more bold you are, the more results you get. My personal favorite is making hella witty and sexually charged jokes anytime I'm around a female I'm attracted to. Mixing humor with desire is a strong aphrodisiac for girls. Mix this with calibrated kino and you're golden. Think of it like an exercise in the gym, you're exercising your BOLD muscle. Once it grows, you'll have momentum on your side and others will start to pick up on your IDGAF attitude. Then your social circle builds because you're an interesting person to be around. It only gets better. Before TRP, Even as a complete social-anxiety-ridden mess in social settings, I was confident as fuck in things like video games/chess/music. I would be hilarious over the mic and in-game chats because I was IN MY ELEMENT. I was used to it, it was my domain and I was comfortable. **Seek to make social interactions and meeting people your DEFAULT. Make it your element and something that comes naturally and comfortably to you.** 
 
**4. Take fitness/lifting seriously.**

This has been stressed more times in more threads than I can even begin to count. The wholesome, raw confidence, mixed with the discipline of a strict training regime is *THE MOST* valuable attribute I've gained since I began this journey. I feel like a million bucks in every room I walk into. Rarely is there someone bigger than me, but when I do see someone bigger, I respect them and their dedication. Not jealous at all, glad that they have reached a level I aspire to be on someday. I always make it a point to talk lifting with the biggest dudes at parties and bars. Their eyes light up like fucking christmas because all big dudes love to talk about lifting. Good way to meet alpha buddies too; something the majority of the sub-base here tend to struggle with. Be dedicated as fuck til you reach the point where people move out of your way in heavily crowded areas and you receive the [Nod of Acknowledgement](http://www.urbandictionary.com/author.php?author=%20Unbiased%20Definitions) everywhere you go. 

**5. Embrace discomfort.**

You have to make the connection in your mind that the things that you don't want to do today are your happiness and joy tomorrow. Still haven't taken that cold shower that is recommended here once a week have you? TRY IT. Set an alarm on your phone for 5 minutes and make a game out of it. Pretend your on fear factor or some shit to make it fun. Free increase of testosterone. Still haven't tried the no electronics in the bedroom rule have you? TRY IT. I'll bet you $5 your sleep quality increases.  Still haven't tried the goal of 10 approach-rejections a day before you're allowed to go home have you? TRY IT. I bet you close some numbers and start generating plates faster than you thought. These and many other actions that are recommended here have huge potential and dividends if you would just give them an honest try. Tired after a long day and just want to binge-watch Narcos? No. Fuck that and fuck you. Get off your ass and do one of the above or something you've been ""trying"" to do but haven't ""gotten around to it"". Then you can watch an episode of Narcos before bed as a reward for doing something worth a fuck. 

**6. Women are a lagging indicator**

You'll notice none of these points are about women directly. That's because the only failsafe method to approach TRP is to **Build it and they will come**. SMV Rules all. I'm gonna type that again. **SMV RULES ALL** Fuck your lazy habits, fuck your endless video games, fuck your blue-pilled friends, fuck your shitty oneitis, fuck your ""crippling anxiety"", fuck your shitty sense of dress and style, fuck your bad hygiene, fuck your poor choice in foods, fuck your half assed-workouts, fuck your dead-end job, fuck all of that. This is a results driven world. Get it the fuck done!

976,8lgs4t,"It took me some time to realize what SMV really meant. On the surface, it boils down to a number on scale of relative attractiveness. And there's definitely some truth to that. However, in order to better understand the concept, I think it's important to break it down further.

----

How is the value of anything in a particular market established? What does every market attempt to capture? Only the most valuable currency known to this planet. Human attention. 

Paying attention to something is a way of assigning value. The quality and amount of attention given determine relative value. And the more you pay attention to someone or something, the more you signal to the rest of the world (and your own brain) how valuable you believe it to be. This makes sense because if this wasn't the case, logically you wouldn't waste your time or energy on that thing or person.

Pre-selection is powerful. When people pay attention to a particular product, it grows in popularity and demands an increase in price. This is why billions of dollars are spent each year on marketing and advertisement. 

Women market themselves through sexual availability and physical appeal. Those who men pay attention to the most have the highest sexual market value. This is fairly obvious. This is why men can easily be attracted to women in seconds, while women generally take longer to become attracted because they seek out behavioral traits that aren't quite apparent at first glance.

When you give your attention away freely, it becomes clear that you don't value your own time. People are well-attuned to sensing this subconsciously. When a man orbits a woman, he broadcasts the fact that her time is more valuable than his, and will therefore supplicate to her whims and emotions. This is such a turnoff to women because women are attracted to *value*. And when you don't provide value, you are of no use to her. 

In the age of social media, women have been inundated with validation from men who don't know the value of their own time. This causes some women to believe that they are much more valueable than they really are. And as we all know, perception is reality.

The trick to this is, if your frame is unshakeable and you truly believe something, reality will bend to your psychological frame of reference because reality is based upon the perception of obvservers.

However, your brain isn't stupid, you can't fool yourself forever. Repeating a mantra of ""I am alpha and tough and all women want me"" is no substute for actual self-improvement. The basis of a strong frame is actually going out and becoming successful, no matter how you might define it. In order to truly believe that you and your time have value, you must improve yourself. Investing money into a product will increase its value. Investing time in yourself is no different. When the reality of your time being valuable is nested in sound logic, when you **know** it to be true, women's emotional reality has no choice but to bend and accept the logically stronger frame. 

As far as human nature is concerned, the man with the strongest frame of reality, the self-actualized successful man, is the man with the highest Sexual Market Value. 

----

The human brain is an excellent servant, but a terrible master. Left to its own devices, it will seek to conserve and hoard energy. In the modern world of excess this manifests as laziness and gluttony. Your natural desires for success are placated by virtual fantasies transmitted through black mirrors in our pockets and living rooms: video games, porn, tv, social media, etc. But these virtual successes are short-lived and unfulfilling. People are so depressed, anxious, and short-tempered these days because they are trapped by *webs* and filtered by *screens*. 

Time will go by regardless. It is how you invest that time which determines your success in life. The more you value your time, the more you will spend it wisely. The more wisely you spend your time, the more valuable your time will become. Its a positive feedback loop.

But you must be selective about how you spend your time. Don't get caught in the virtual web of distractions. Take intelligent action to improve your life and nature will reward you for your efforts. This doesn't mean you must be a slave to productivity 24/7. In order to maximize the value your time provides, relaxation and rest are absolutely essential as well. Optimization requires balance.

It may be a stretch of the term, but I'm of the opinion that life is really just an elaborate shit test, designed to *screen* out the unworthy who aren't strong and intelligent enough to shape reality for themselves. Fortune favors the bold and nature destroys the weak. This is natural selection in action. If you can't figure out how to survive and thrive, nature has no place for you and it will shit on you with no remorse. Nature is amoral and your time is valuable.

 Sylvia Plath, *The Bell Jar*

Around two years or so ago. I became attractive.

I’d swallowed the pill a while back, but like most of you, I assumed I was some kind of exception and didn’t lift. Well I kind of did, but had a pretty severe case of fuck-around-itis and no discipline; not to mention an inability to cook and feed myself properly. I made no gains. 

I was redpill aware, and gamed girls, but really didn’t make that much progress. I knew how to pass shit-tests but didn’t get any, I knew what to do with LMR but had no girls in my room. 9s and 10s were actually quite kind to me; I mistook this for attraction, not realising that I’d actually just fallen into the “asexual-child” category women put guys in who are not even considered men, let alone a prospect.  

Eventually the humility hit me, I couldn’t stay deluded forever, and I had to accept it when looking at myself in the mirror. I was ugly.

Now I had been given a few gifts that I was wasting; one was height, no one can call me “tall”, but I’m above the average at least, so, hypothetically, I was at the threshold most women needed to consider me. The other was a not-ugly face. I wasn’t beautiful, I didn’t have a thick jaw or strong cheekbones, but my face was passable; no stand out blemishes or disproportioned features.

I can work with this, I thought. I may not be Brad Pitt but I can scrape through into “attractive” if I work hard enough. 

There were however, downsides to the gifts, and things I didn’t get; my height came with a skinny, ectomorphic body, with an albatross armspan leading to thin wrists and pencil neck. My face can be considered feminine, boyish; more Justin Bieber than Ryan Gosling, weak chin, unable to grow a beard, or even sufficient stubble. My hair at the time was long, thick and gay. My back twisted into one of the worst cases of rounded shoulders I have seen on anyone, with a forward facing nerd neck, video-gamers anterior pelvic tilt, the whole shebang. It was gross. 

I was a 3, if I’m being nice. But at that level ratings mean nothing anyway; anything less than a 7 and you’re invisible to women. 

At the time I still had this magical idea of women, that they were different than us, that they could look past the beauty and be attracted to alpha-personality on the inside, that they didn’t need us to look good in order to want to fuck us, we could make up for it in other ways. That they had better control of their sexual urges and weren’t as visually turned on as us. That they didn’t really enjoy sex like we do and degeneracy put them off; that they were pure, poised beings with grace and innocence.

Lmao. Delusional. 

After years of painful rejections and bitchy put downs, I stopped making excuses and began to accept that I wasn’t the exception; I needed to lift and fix my body in order to become attractive; all the game in the world couldn’t help me if I still looked like a teenage fedora nerd.

So I began to take it seriously.
________________________
I started off as a 3. 

The first thing that happened was my posture sorted itself. Deadlifts and Bent-Over-Rows fixed my forward shoulders within a fortnight. Stretches solved the APT. I was purposefully checking my posture and neck whenever I remembered, and forcing myself upright. It was uncomfortable, sometimes painful, at first, but my body fell into a new equilibrium and settled. I stood up straighter and sat better in chairs; people would notice, a few said “did you get taller?”. I became a 4. 
________________

Next I cut my hair. It used to hang below my ears cos fuck gender norms and short haircuts were for jocks and I liked heavy metal. This time though I told a new barber to cut it short. Men have short hair.

It was a disaster. I was horrified at the boot-camp haircut he gave me, it made my face look even skinnier and gaunter than before.

But I pushed through it, after a few weeks the hair grew out and became scruffy and messy and actually… looked good. I suddenly felt 3 years older and more masculine, looked like an actual male. I began taking care of it better, stopped shampooing it every day like a retard, and after a few weeks of grease it settled into a natural, thick cleanliness. It felt so nice I would just play with it sometimes. 

People commented; “your hair looks so much better this way”. I became a 5.
_______

At this point I was lifting properly. I was going 4 times a week, no exceptions, no excuses, and enjoying it. I wasn’t lifting heavy, and was a bit insecure about my low weight on the bar, but knew ego-lifting was for pussies who hurt themselves. More importantly though, I was cooking properly, and eating properly. I enjoyed this new hobby, cooking, more than the lifting. I was hungry all the time, something I had never known or experienced, and so I grazed throughout the day until I was hitting 3k+ calories consistently. Everything about me got slightly chubbier, and I stopped being able to see my ribs; my face started packing on fat too, and began to take on a more masculine appearance, my skin looked and felt different. A few people said “you look healthier, you look like you’re glowing”. I became a 6. 

____________________

I changed my wardrobe. I’d just hit it big time on a STEM scholarship so splurged out on new clothes. At first I went on reddit fashion subreddits and brought desert boots and oxford shirts and chinos, but I looked like a damn Victorian twink wearing all this. I was very self-conscious going outside because it just didn’t feel right, it was like I was in a costume.

Sometimes I would go out in sweats and a hoodie and trainers and think “wow I actually look kind of badass” like, old women would walk across the street to avoid me. So I adopted the style. I dressed like a black dude for a while and felt much more comfortable; it felt like “me”, and it would hide my skinny frame. Eventually I started finding which colours worked for me, and adding my own personality to the style; things about me from teenagehood I couldn’t just drop, band t-shirts and chucks and vans and flannel. It worked, very well. I got compliments from people on the roadman-grunge hybrid, it felt effortless and suited me, didn’t feel like a costume. I’m young, and stopped trying to dress old. I became a 7.
____________________________
It was at this point I started getting looks from women on public transport. I would hop onto a train and a 5/10 would see me and I’d see her and then her eyes would snap away and I’d be like “weird” and then she’d look again and see me looking and her eyes would snap away again and then she’d fix her hair. Often I would check my face to see if I had anything in my nose or whatever.

This kept happening for a while and I was getting quite self-conscious about it. Was I creepy or weird? Was I dressed funny? Have I got a big nose or ears or something and they just can’t stop looking?

It’s been about a year at this point and I can finally squat my bodyweight for 5x5 and while I still look skinny in clothes I check myself out shirtless in the mirror and am impressed. I moved on from my strength program to an aesthetics program and started actively working on my pencil neck to make it thicker and chest to make it wider. I saw results within weeks. Suddenly my neck was solid and thick and I was stretching my shirts. I’d also picked up bouldering and this pumped up my forearms and back like no-ones business. I became an 8.
___________
It started to become undeniable that women were checking me out. Every time I would get on a train there would be at least one woman who would see me and we’d meet eyes and she’d quickly look away. Then her hand would go to her nose and scratch it or she’d smooth down her skirt or she’d fidget or fix her hair or fringe. I didn’t understand why. Often she’d look back at me when she thought I wasn’t looking again and I’d catch her and she’d snap away again and I started having a lot of fun messing with girls this way. 

I even began to count how much it happened during the day; my average is 6. Some days are better than others, normally after a haircut or during rush-hour. Honestly, if this is what it’s like being an attractive guy getting checked out by women, I cannot even begin to imagine what it’s like being an 18 year old HB9 in public; like a minor celebrity probably. No wonder they’re all so damn entitled and full of themselves, the validation is immense. Or maybe it just gets tiring and annoying after a while. I still enjoy it though. 

Some women would hover nearer to me or turn their body so they were facing me and their feet would point in my direction or they’d begin copying things I did or how I sat. Some just couldn’t stop looking, even if I caught them. There was this one girl, not that attractive, who backed up into me on a very crowded sardine train and started grinding her fucking ass into my crotch like we were in a club. I thought it was an accident at first but got a boner anyway but then she kept fucking doing it and I knew for a fact that she could feel my hardon poking her buttcrack yet she continued. 

It started to become flattering when I would get the looks from really hot women. Girls who I still considered out of my league would stare at me and sneak glances and I’d look back like “wtf you looking at” and then they’d sit next to me or across from me and play with their hair or part their legs or touch the inside of their thighs. Sometimes it would come from older women, cougars and milfs who were much more subtle about it but would also smile at me when I caught them looking. 

Oh yeah, the smiles from women were a big giveaway, women don’t randomly smile at ugly men. 

________________

I was still denying it though. Still sneakily checking my reflection in my phone to make sure I didn’t have anything on my face or a booger. I couldn’t accept I was attractive, not after a whole life of invisible betadom. I was actually getting laid at this point though, with 6s and 7s I met at school, and this would improve my mood and mindset. It began to show in the way I walked, my aura changed and I would manspread or check out girls without giving a fuck. At this point, I’m a 9 to some women. I can’t pull off the whole big and masculine thing, still too boyish, but I definitely got that pretty boy Dorian Gray fuckboy vibe going.

It was when I got these stares from women who were with their boyfriends that I began to get blackpilled. They would sit there holding their boyfriends hands or he’d be diddling away on his phone and the bitch would sneak glances and then get all fidgety. We’d meet eyes and I’d hatestare her and then she’d blush and then start grooming herself and the guy would be fucking oblivious. She would continue to sneak glances for a while until they left, or sometimes the guy would pick up on it and then hatestare me back and then put an arm around his girl or something. I don’t blame him. The whole time all I could think was “stop looking at me whore your bf is right there”.

It’s when I started getting stares from the teenage girls and children, some of them quite clearly pre-teens that it started to make me feel sick. I understand that I look like I could be in one-direction or something but I was not ready for this level of blackpilling. They can’t start this early can they? When I was that age all I cared about was yugioh. Wtf are they doing staring at me? This is wrong, very wrong. Often it would make me so uncomfortable I would get off and wait for the next train.
__________________________


Every time I looked in the mirror I was unimpressed, still fuck ugly and twinky, still and forever small.

Yet the indicators from the outside world were undeniable. I would be walking past a group of girls who were talking loudly and they’d all go quiet and look. Women in my vicinity would get louder and more obnoxious, trying to draw my attention. And still, always, excessive spontaneous grooming from any girl who would see me. 

One girl in the library who I used to check out while she squatted at the gym would plop herself down next to me and sigh loudly. Then she’d keep doing it and then accidently bump into me sometimes or drop things and then sigh some more. Another girl followed me around a party and eagerly fetched me drinks and asked me very personal questions until her boyfriend had to confront me and I acted all oblivious. 

A lot of women conveniently forget to mention their boyfriends around me. I’d hang out with them for weeks or months and we’d chat in class and I’d flirt quite heavily but subtly as I’m good at it by now and she just won’t tell me she has a boyfriend until I either find out myself through social media or I see them together or she’s forced to mention it because we’re in a group setting or one of her friends sabotages her and brings it up. Normally there’s a quick “wtf bitch why u do that” look between the two girls after. Hilarious shit. 

_____

Then you get the betas who are scared of you and treat you like a king. The guys who stutter around you and worship the ground you walk on. You have the guys at the gym who end their sets early if you ask them for the rack because they’re so fucking agreeable they’re scared of telling you they have sets left. There was a dude who basically did my coursework for me for a while, whenever I’d ask him for help with a question he just sent me the full answer and it confused me at first why this guy was bending over backwards for me until I found out he was a faggot and that’s when I realised just how much worship women get from betas; pathetic.

Then you have the betas who are absolutely threatened by you and try to AMOG you at every turn. They get all hyper-competitive in groups, especially with girls, and are fucking loud and obnoxious. I just sit back and let them crash and burn, knowing the golden rule is the more you talk the more faggy you come across. I feel kinda bad for these guys because they’re not attractive and hate you because you are, but they don’t lift or make any real effort and think being aggressive makes them more alpha so not my problem. 

________
Ugly and average girls are super nice to me and give me the sparkle eyes like I’m a god and seem to be happy they’re just in my presence. They laugh at everything I say even when I’m not trying to be funny and stalk my facebook profile with their friends (attested by the random likes on photos posted 4 years ago). Pretty girls go into full on bitch mode as soon as we meet. This never happened before, I was treated like a child before, but still human. Now the 8s and up all assume I want to fuck them (or hope I do) so start shit-testing me from the first word. 

Then there’s the girls who change their whole personality around you and become fake. There’s this histrionic jewish girl in my class who bounces around me and does all she can to try and impress me and is wild and childish but in that attractive way where you know she’s crazy in the sack. It was cute at first so I asked her if she wanted to hang out after class with my friends to smoke weed and so we did and I brought my bro round who is one of my best friends but also kind of beta still and we all smoked and he didn’t really say anything embarrassing or cringey he’s just kind of shy and doesn’t lift and this whore went into full on beta shaming putdown mode on the dude and made fun of him and laughed. It made me SO angry that she could so easily flip between submissive sex kitten to ice queen sneering maneater, especially to my best friend, and so I caught that shit and stopped it as tactfully as I could in the situation then ghosted her. 
_____________________
At this point I’m actually getting laid a lot, from women who meet my standards, and it’s hard not to start hating women and just how fucking degenerate they can be. I started off being scared of women; thinking they were smart little princesses with sweet smiles, and they terrified me because they seemed to see right through me and had this magical, ethereal power of intuition. Now I know that was just me projecting my own weakness and insecurity and actually they’re all fucking stupid and malicious and irrational.

Before trp I didn’t hate women. They baffled me, they confused me, they scared me, but I didn’t hate them. I treated them with “respect”, which really meant I kissed ass and sucked up to them. I didn’t get laid.

Now I get laid, and I hate women. Now they piss me off. Now they frustrate me. Now they disappoint me. Now I’m a misogynist.
________
I’m not a woman hater due to inexperience like the feminists think so, in fact when I was inexperienced I treated women better than I ever do now. It’s precisely because I deal with the prettiest and smartest girls on the daily that I’ve come to the conclusion that they’re all fucking retarded. All of them. If they’re pretty they’re a whore. If they’re smart they’re also a whore. The “smartest” girls I know are the biggest sex addicts and wildest in bed. If they’re not a whore they’re normally ugly, or just fucking dopey, or incredibly bitchy and hard to be around. 

Oh and “boyfriend”. Lol. That word means nothing to pre-wall women. Or at least, it doesn’t mean what we think it means. It means companion. It means backup option. It means fashion accessory. It means status symbol. To be paraded around and make other girls jealous. But it definitely does not mean “exclusive sex partner”. The “boyfriend” is a term for the baseline, comfortable branch she’s sitting on at the moment while reaching for a higher-chad, at the slightest hint of confirmed upgrade the dude is dropped. Closest translation to trpSpeak is “main plate”. There is no such thing as a girl who is 100% exclusive to her man, they all cheat, and often without thinking about it, never ""on purpose"". They don’t see it as cheating, it's just normal to them, they feel entitled to it. Their definition of cheating changes with their whims and the weather. I’ve banged way too many girls with boyfriends to ever take the “I have a boyfriend” shit-test at face value. 

You’ll be surprised at the things girls tell you when you’ve just pounded her into an existential crisis and she realises you’ll never actually commit to her, you know she’s a whore and accept it without judgement. She’s honest in that moment. The n-counts they reveal… the experiences they’ve had, and the way they speak about their boyfriends, or orbiters… With utter contempt! With revulsion, mockery! I’ve had more than one girl lay there telling me about the size of another guys dick or how much of a pussy he is or laughing about when he cried or did something embarrassing and it made me fucking sick. 
________________
I’ll be laying in bed after having cum in some girls asshole and she’ll sigh as she picks up her phone and there are 20 ignored messages from her orbiters and I’ll sometimes look over and it will be something like “sorry for getting all emotional yesterday I was drunk lol, wanna get lunch today?” and she’d be like “not today sorry xxox” and if only the dude knew that she’s laying on my chest scratching my balls with her other hand while typing this. Sometimes I’m pounding a girl with a fistful of hair and her phone keeps buzzing and it’s her boyfriend and I say “aren’t you gonna get that” and she says “nah just ignore it” and I say “it’s distracting switch it off” so she switches off her phone.

And then you have the ones who are all sweet and innocent and demure and shy and have the perfectly cultivated family oriented social medias and aesthetic photography instagrams yet are in an uber to your place at the slightest hint of a booty call and eagerly tongue swirl your asshole while you browse reddit on your phone.
_________________________
The wool is no longer over my eyes. It has been burnt away violently. They’re all whores. All of them. women on the train who stare without shame. The MILFs who brush their tits up against you. The teenage girls who think they’re being sneaky taking snapchats of your manspread. The girls who kiss you while their boyfriend is in the other room at the party. The girls who sit in front of you during lectures and bend over and turn around a lot. The girls who take selfies for their boyfriends while their lower half is grinding on your dick.

All of them. Without exception. All it took for me was to get attractive and suddenly I’m in a completely new world, an entirely different fucked up game where the true nature of the female sex is revealed. Becoming Chad was the best and worst thing that ever happened to me. Sure I wasn’t getting laid before but at least I had faith in the “fairer” sex and my world was more pleasant. The illusion was nice to uphold for a while… but now that it’s shattered I’m left with a disgusting, stark, reality that I didn’t sign up for. I didn’t want this shit, send me back to the Matrix please.

You don’t get hit by the anger phase just once, it comes in waves. Initially when you swallow the pill, but multiple times after that. The first time you fuck a cute little thing and she treats you like a sex-god only to realise you’re actually her plate and she treats every other guy this way too. The first time you accidentally meet the kids of that woman who’s face you cum-splattered a few days before. The first time you get given an STD by that small innocent girl you met at the art gallery. Each time you’ll get the surge of rage. Why the fuck do they have to be like this? How can they ALL be like this, yet uphold the good-girl image so perfectly and sweetly? They’re all fucking whores. They’re all damn liars. 

The sex isn’t worth it. After overindulging as Chad for a while it becomes boring. Meaningless. I don’t want to use these girls as fucktoys, I hate it. And even if I stopped, some other guys will use them anyway. I just wish they’d all stop being lying fucktoys period. Can’t we just have enforced monogamy again where everyone fucks only one person their whole life and sex isn’t a big fucking deal at all? Where we understand the destructive nature of sex as a drug and keep it under control?

Yes I know it’s delusional and beta of me and imma get the spergs like “still bluepill, still anger phase why r u endosrsed u retard, just deal with it enjoy the decline blab la bla” but fuck man, if you’d seen what I’ve seen you wouldn’t just be able to cope with this shit and remain a bystander, it’s sad what’s happened to our women. They’re not the enemy, they’re not something to be used and enjoyed and thrown away, they’re our sisters and mothers and daughters…“enjoy the decline” is for hedonistic, nihilist losers, faggots who assume they have no power in the world so just fucking give up trying to change it.  

I became attractive to get girls, I became Chad, and the world I was inducted into horrifies me. I want out.

I have a subreddit. Link in my profile.",977,4.0,0.326200008392334,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
978,7u0msk,"Last year, my buddy's business took off and he's making a ridiculous amount of money. He makes more in 6 weeks than most people make in a year. It's sick, I admit even I'm jealous of him.


He'd been dating the same girl for 4 years. She has a 'strong personality', he's beta-ish and easygoing, so she often just bowled him over and got her own way. Even so, it seemed like they were happy, they had discussed buying a house together, all signs were pointing to marriage in the near future -- which is why it was such a surprise when he broke up with her 2 weeks ago. 


I finally got to see him last weekend and his side of the story is crazy. When she found out exactly how much he was making last summer, she immediately wanted to quit her job and ""come work for him"" (even though there's nothing she'd be qualified to do). He said no, but from that point onward she regularly pressured him about it -- increasing her demands to wanting to travel the world together on his dime, have him pay off her student loans, etc. 


She started getting unjustifiably suspicious. She wanted to know where he was at all hours of the day, who he was talking to, who he was texting. I remember we'd go out and he'd stare at his phone half the night answering her calls and texts. He basically wasn't allowed to speak to or hang out with girls alone anymore, no matter the scenario.


She basically ruined their Christmas by being standoffish all day because he ""only"" got her a $500 watch. He said by this time they weren't even having sex anymore (!) -- she was just resentful and hostile toward him pretty much 24/7. But that didn't stop her from talking about marriage and trying to guilt him into proposing soon. Every day she'd be showing him expensive cars, houses, wedding venues and travel destinations. All she talked about was money and ways to spend it.


Finally, two weeks ago he woke up at 3AM to find her awake and going through his phone. That was the nail in the coffin; after a huge argument he ended the relationship. She came to her senses and tried desperately to get back together a few days later, ""apologizing and taking full responsibility for everything"", but he (smartly) refused. Now she's been running her yap to all their mutual friends about how ""money has changed him"" and ""he thinks he's too good for me now"". So now a lot of people think he's an asshole. 


I found the whole scenario amusing. If she hadn't altered her behavior, they'd most definitely still be together right now. Most girls would start cooking him 5-star meals and fucking him like a pornstar, yet she basically did the opposite. I don't understand her thought process, it's like the thought of being rich short-circuited her brain.

979,39qnwd,"The trick to starting random conversations is to simply let people in to your interior monologue.

I NEVER think in terms of ""starting conversations,"" but if you hung out with me for a day you would say ""wow, that guy starts conversations with everyone he sees!""

It is because I am *not trying to start conversations.* Rather, I am simply aware that I am a good person, and a smart and social guy –  and therefore I am entitled to enlighten other people with a thought or two from my interior monologue.

When I see a person walking a dog that I think is cute, there is no thinking ""should I say something to this person?"" because I am already telling them that their dog is cute.

When I see an attractive woman in the bookstore, there is no questioning to myself whether or not I should talk to her, because by that time I am already telling her not to buy that Dave Eggers book because Dave Eggers is a terrible writer and she will not benefit from her purchase.

I think genuine self-knowledge and self-awareness goes a long way towards achieving this state of Omni-Talkativeness. When I looked deep inside myself and searched my motives, I was a little surprised by the fact that inside, I am a genuinely good person who genuinely wants the best for people.

**Society implants moral self-doubt within us.** Society teaches us that ""evil lurks in the hearts of men."" That's why I was *surprised* when I looked deep inside myself and found... no evil. No malice. Only a desire to do good. 

Society has lied to you – it has lied to you about who *other people are*, and it has lied to you about who *you* are. Chances are that you hold a few negative beliefs about yourself. Maybe you secretly believe that you're ""selfish,"" or ""bad.""

But look within. Seriously, look. Do you want to kill anyone? Do you want to hurt anyone? Do you want to make anyone cry?

No? Well, then you are definitely *not* a bad person.

Keep looking within. Do you have a desire to help your friends achieve their dreams and live dope lives? Do you have a desire to give sexual pleasure to women you are attracted to? Do you have a desire to become the best version of yourself, and to help your fellow man become the best version of *him*self?

If you answered ""Yes"" to these questions, then I've got news for you, motherfucker: **You're a good person.** Not only that, you are a fucking *insanely* good person. Most people never ask themselves these questions, so they spend their whole lives *wondering if they are a good person or not.* But if you go inside and ask yourself these questions, you just might realize that you **know** you are a good person. And once you've got that level of self-knowledge, *no one can take it away from you.*

If a person assumes I have ill intent, I am not upset: they are simply wrong. I do not have ill intent. Because I have looked inside myself and realized that actually I have only *good* intent.

With that knowledge embedded deep within my ""frame,"" there is no part of me that ""hesitates"" before talking to someone. Since I *know* on the deepest level that I am a genuinely good guy who wants the best for people, there is no reason to even THINK of THE CONCEPT of asking myself if I should interact with someone – because by that time, I am already interacting.

When you have this kind of positive self-image on a *moral* level, talking to other people is the easiest shit ever. Your confidence is absolute, because you are simply aware that there are only two possible outcomes to each interaction, both of which are positive:

* You have a fun chat and never talk to the person again.
* You have a fun chat and wind up developing a relationship with the person and getting the opportunity to make their lives more awesome.

There is simply no negative scenario that can occur.

TBH bros, I think that talking about ""avoiding approach anxiety"" is completely missing the point. That's like trying to put a band-aid on top of a cancerous tumor (the tumor = the subconscious belief that you do not deserve to talk to people, which stems from the subconscious desire to TAKE something from people instead of GIVE them something).

You must travel deep inside yourself and flip an invisible switch. 

You are a person who engages in interactions. The reason you are not ""social"" is this: In your interactions, you have been focused on *how you can benefit from the interactions you engage in*. 

Here is the switch you must flip: To become ""social,"" you must *stop* thinking in terms of *taking* and start thinking in terms of *giving.* **You must start thinking in terms of *how the other person can benefit from interacting with you.* (Trust me, that's the only thing they're thinking about anyway. Once you're thinking about that too, then you're both on the same page.)**

The only questions you should be asking yourself: What do I have to offer this person? What do I have to give? (Friendship? Good cheer? The D?) How can I make their lives more awesome?

When you meet women, often the answer to these questions is obvious: the most effective way you can make their lives more awesome is to give them the D that they thirst for so passionately. When you meet men, the answer is often less obvious – sometimes you can give them knowledge, sometimes you can teach them a skill, other times you can just give them the gift of a few light-hearted observations on whatever is happening.

For me, attaining the state of Omni-Talkativeness is a *moral* journey that is 100% internal.",979,4.0,0.33379998803138733,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
980,6hlhh4,"I was just using reddit on a new account and went to see the front page, when I read the first words of a current top post, and it basically says a woman went missing during a gaming conference that was just concluded in LA. I paid no mind to it when I first saw it like half an hour ago, but I reloaded the r-all, as you often do, and I happened to see the second half of the headline about her: she went missing during a ""mixer."" Well, it kind of just clicked in my head instantly. She probably had a few too many drinks, and you could probably guess what happened next. I was intrigued. So I had a theory in mind as to why she went missing, and it wasn't long before I found that she had already re-surfaced and it turns out that she's fine. I wanted more info, so I kept searching, and lo and behold, she actually has a boyfriend/husband. It took no more than a minute of more searching to find this exchange they just had on twitter.

Need I say more?

My takeaway from this is, a bunch of white knights made it a point to take a non-occurrence and turn it into a national news story, no doubt thinking to themselves what good guys they all are for doing the right thing and helping a damsel in distress. When in reality, the girl in question was just having fun, as girls do, to the point that even her own bf had no idea what happened to her. And he still doesn't.

If he's any good as a man, this should be a glowing red flag that this bitch needs to be dropped. Here's hoping that everybody gets what's coming to them.

*Edit*: I should add that in both of the front-page posts where this topic is covered (primarily where the original call for help to find her was first announced by the random white knight), there are a lot of controversial and deleted posts. The first thread about it that I opened has also been locked as of this writing.

And this topic has been posted on at least 1 other subreddit as of this writing, specifically r-drama. And there you can find some RP comments about it, some that you would probably already be thinking yourself. I highly recommend that you go and take a look. This should serve as an example of the red pill theory stated thusly:

**Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks**

*Edit 2*: [The plot thickens](http://i.imgur.com/QAi1y9N.png)

*Edit 3*: [""She even sounds like she's been deepthroating.""](http://a.pomf.cat/lceuzz.mp4) - She posted this video as confirmation that she's alive and well but later deleted it, probably after she realized that her posting this confirms that she was in a hotel room with *someone* but fortunately, it has been backed up and here for us to see.

*Edit 4*: This will probably be my last edit on this for now, but I found this [twitter reply](https://twitter.com/asmiseasy/status/875628688833773568) where the BF was talking with a rando and she literally said the bitch is now gonna get kicked out no matter what she did. Hope he follows through.

*Edit 5*: Credit to user -Unnamed- for this recap of what has happened so far: 

>""She was supposed to be on a panel at e3 and at a booth or whatever. The day before she got drunk and went somewhere. Then no one heard from her for over twenty hours. As a girl who had an event to attend, tweets fucking constantly, and wasnt even contacting her husband, it was suspicious. The internet took off with it. Later she posted a video saying she's ok and just missed e3. But it was inside some sketchy hotel that no one recognized. So she deleted the video. Then later she posts a video from the road. But it turns out she's not the brightest bulb on the tree because that sidewalk was literally outside the same hotel. So weaponized autism on the internet pinpointed her location using clues from the two videos such as curtains and road signs in the background. Turns out to be some sketchy motel. They called the motel and used the missing persons report to see if anyone matching her description stayed there. They confirmed. Everyone started calling her out on twitter for cheating on her husband until she finally cracked and was like ""we aren't even together anymore lol""

>TLDR; thot blows off fans at e3 to blow off some dude in a motel

If that last part is true, and it has been confirmed that this girl and the supposed bf ""aren't even together anymore"" then this all becomes an even bigger shitshow. Apparently Beta Billy over here still thinks they're together but the missing princess thinks that's a load of shit? I can't even laugh it's so embarrassing.

*Final Edit*: Really glad this got massive attention on TRP, unfortunately our guy just doesn't get it at all.

981,c1bzuh,"*Note: This is an edited version of a response I gave a couple of weeks ago on asktrp. Rewriting and posting here so more people will see it.*

So you're at the point in life where you feel like you ought to start getting shit figured out, but somehow--almost certainly due to your own ignorance and sloth--things just never started coming together for you, and you spend all your free time playing Fortnite and masturbating. I can't do anything about your sloth, but after reading this post, hopefully you won't be quite so ignorant.

Getting your shit together involves a three-pronged attack.

**ONE: GET YOUR UNDERLYING STATS UP**

Part of the reason you feel so anxious and helpless is because you have it in your head that you're worthless. Maybe not *completely* worthless, but other people your age are miles better than you, and both you and they know it. Before you can start telling yourself, ""Fuck those people, I know I'm awesome"" you have to be somewhat awesome, or at least well on your way there. Your tasks are:

* Take school seriously. Keep those grades high.
* Lift weights. Eat a diet high in protein. Add muscle. Shed body fat. If you're a giant fatass, cut back to one meal a day, low carbs.
* Dress better. Get a halfway decent haircut. I don't care if you decide to sit on your ass all day and not talk to anybody, but you aren't going to look like a total slob doing it.
* Clean up your room, your locker, your car. You might be ashamed of yourself, but there's no reason to be ashamed of the space you inhabit. Stop sabotaging yourself; it's not that fucking difficult to be tidy.
* This can come a little bit down the road, but learn how to cook. If you don't know how to change your oil, you can take it to a mechanic and be pretty sure they'll do a competent job. If you don't know how to nourish yourself, you can go to a restaurant, and while they may do a competent job of making your taste buds happy, they sure as hell aren't going to make sure your body is fueling itself with the correct mix of macronutrients. Learning to make cheap, healthy food taste good will do so much to improve your day-to-day experience that it's unreal.

**TWO: GET YOUR HEADSPACE RIGHT**

Most of you assholes have convinced yourself that you have some kind of depression. Maybe you do, maybe you don't, but either way, your batteries are probably sitting on low. That means you aren't going to want to do much of anything. OK, fine. You're going to have a lot of free time. I don't care what you fill it with, but *stop filling it with crap*. The key is to avoid short-term dopamine hits, because those will make your brain chemistry even worse.

* No porn. No elaborate jack-off sessions. Take two minutes every few days to check that the ol' prostate is still working, then move on with your day; don't weave some elaborate fantasy out of it.
* I'll say it again, no porn. Seriously. That shit rewires your brain. You want to get horny when you see a cute girl your age wearing a nice outfit, not inure yourself to the female form so much that you can only get hard if you're watching a dozen black dudes in horse masks tag-team a pregnant midget. That's what happens when the ""regular stuff"" stops doing it for you. And the ""regular stuff"" isn't that fucking regular anyway.
* No videogames. For most of you, this will be harder to cut than porn, if not downright impossible. So let's say no more than 30 minutes to start with. And if you're going to play, try to play with someone that you know rather than just sitting there alone. The more you start getting your other shit together, the more you're going to realize videogames are a giant waste of time unless they're a social activity. (And the more you start moving in social circles that have successful people in them, the more you're going to realize that winners do other things besides play videogames when they get together, but that's an epiphany for a later date.)
* No caffeine. Caffeine fucks your sleep. Now, you aren't going to be able to cold-turkey porn, videogames, and caffeine all at once, and I'd put caffeine at the bottom of that list, but coffee is a crutch, and nobody learns how to walk--much less run--if they're stuck relying on a crutch. If you're drinking soda, cut that shit immediately, though... it's about the worst stuff you can possibly fuel your body with, and it'll rot the teeth out of your head.
* Get off Reddit. Or at least unsubscribe from subs where the whole idea is to point at people and laugh at how stupid they are. Same thing goes for ""outrage porn"" that reinforces how dumb/evil/corrupt the people on the opposite side of the political spectrum are. How the fuck does that help you get in a frame of mind to succeed?
* Ditto the YouTube videos you watch and the books you read. Watch, listen to, and learn from people that you *admire*, not people that you disdain. There are lots of people out there that do have their shit together, and they're more than willing to tell you how they did it *for free*. In this day and age, the only excuse for not knowing how to do some basic shit is not having the willingness to seek it out.
* Don't binge Netflix shows.
* **YES** to reading, exercise, yoga, walking the dog, hobbies like painting or woodworking where you are making something in the real world, a part-time job, doing chores, writing, volunteering. Stop thinking you don't have time to do stuff. Almost all of you are wasting 4+ hours a day between videogames, Reddit, YouTube, PornHub, and Netflix. If you set yourself a rule to avoid all that crap, you'd be amazed how much of your day still needs to be filled with something. You can make it something worthwhile.
* To elaborate on those last two bullets, do you know how many basic bitches--both male and female--are on dating apps thinking that the stuff that they *consume* is what defines their personality, rather than the stuff they *produce*? It is not to your credit that you like *The Office*. A retarded turtle could like *The Office.* Define yourself by what you're able to *do*, not by what other people have made.
* Get more sleep. That means quality sleep when it's dark outside, not lying in bed until fucking noon. Don't keep your phone or your laptop within ten feet of your bed. Don't read them in bed, ever. If it's 10:30 at night and you aren't tired, that means you should have been more physically active during the day. You can simulate the effect by taking a long, cold shower. Stand under the water until your teeth are chattering, then stay there for another 7-8 minutes.

**THREE: UNCALCIFY YOURSELF SOCIALLY**

Here's something a lot of people don't realize. In the absence of major trauma like going to war or losing a parent (and no, losing a girlfriend is nowhere near being in the same ballpark; women are replaceable), once you've broken through a particular type of social anxiety, it's gone forever. There's little to no backsliding. Exposure therapy is the thing. Go do shit that scares you a little bit. It might take three or four times before it stops scaring you at all, but once that problem is solved it's fucking solved for good.

Go talk to people just for shits and gigs. Tell a stranger at the park you like their shirt. Sign up for stuff that you have a legitimate interest in, even if you suck right now and don't know anybody who'll be there. Work out at the gym and then strip down naked and take a shower in front of people. This stuff if only difficult because you have a mental block--chip away at the block; it doesn't grow back.

Now let's talk a little bit about alcohol and weed. A lot of people will tell you that alcohol and weed will help loosen you up, while other people will tell you that weed and alcohol are vices that distract way too many people away from their purpose. Both sides are correct; this is a nuanced subject.

* Will these drugs open you up socially? Yes. (Though weed can also make you a paranoid wreck and keep you inside on the couch.)
* Do these drugs give your charisma score a boost? No. If you can't talk to women because you have social anxiety but are otherwise an interesting person, alcohol might help open you up. If women don't want to talk to you because you're a boring fuck, alcohol won't help at all.
* Should you go to a social event where there'll be drinking and smoking? Maybe. Is it a chill environment with people you trust? Then probably. If you get caught, are you going to lose your job or get kicked off the track team? Then probably not.
* Are you a giant pussy if you don't drink or smoke? At any one time, no. But over the course of your entire young adulthood, yeah you probably are. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you're a pussy *because* you don't drink or smoke. I'm saying that you're probably a pussy in general, and not drinking or smoking is just a symptom of that. Going out and getting drunk might help you uncalcify yourself socially, but it's a small part in getting your shit together, and learning how to not be a pussy in general is a much more important thing to learn. In fact, if you lean into weed or alcohol too hard, it becomes counterproductive. Speaking of which...
* Is getting high or drunk an accomplishment? No! This is one that took me a long time to learn. In my teens, I was a pussy-ass introvert with social anxiety. As I improved, I found myself with more and more plans to go out on Friday and Saturday nights. At first, getting drunk with friends seemed like a pretty cool achievement, since it was something I never had the balls to do in high school. But as you take stock of What Did I Accomplish This Week, let me tell you, getting hammered doesn't belong anywhere near that list beyond maybe the first time.

**LASTLY**

Don't be too hard on yourself. Don't get lazy, but as long as you're getting better at *something* over the course of any given 3-4 day period, you're on the right track. You don't have to do everything at once. What will kill you is fucking backsliding. Don't backslide. Though inevitably you will here and there. When that happens, don't throw your hands up and think all is lost and go back to the sack of shit you were before. Move past it and keep plugging away. Progress isn't linear. Don't get discouraged. It does get easier. Like they say, nothing succeeds like success. Winning at life produces a positive feedback loop. The more shit you get under your control, the easier everything else becomes.

982,76dlah,"Hey guys. I decided to write a post as I've never really contributed but I've taken a whole lot from here.

I ended a 3 year LTR as I wanted to be single, that's it really. It wasn't horrible. She wasn't evil. I just wanted to have sex with a whole bunch of different girls. Turns out using the basics from here, it's real easy.

Me.
Late 20s

I live in a big city.

Own my apartment I live in alone.

Professional job

Muay Thai for about 10 years

Not a lifter but the kickboxing keeps me in decent enough shape. Not a big dude at all. Think ""fighting thin"" 6""1 and about 175lbs. 

On a normal day I'm a 6.5 at my best I'm a 7.

I am writing this as a bullet point list really. I've found dating to be utterly hassle free which has come as a shock to me so I figured I would just pop down some stuff that I've found and hopefully it benefits people. Most of it is obvious / simple. 

Essentially this is a list of practical things with no order or theme. Please add yours in the comments. I don't mention the actual meeting of girls much as to be honest I don't know how I do it really. No set way. Tinder. Parties. Bars (my least successful place for meeting). I don't go to clubs. Friends of friends. Language classes. Just out in the world really. 

1. When arranging dates I always pick a bar near my house and I tell the girls this to make it clear why we are meeting. ""Let's meet at bar X because it's right next to my apartment."" Note the use of BECAUSE. This works well. I go home with a lot of first dates. A couple of them have told me they noticed it and liked the confidence / the leading.

2. Give yourself a chance. Be as attractive as you can be. Trimmed nails. Regular haircuts. Styled facial hair. New clothes. The clothes don't have to be expensive. I bought a 10 pack of cheap plain t shirts. They fit right and look new. That's all that matters. Throw out stuff that you know is dead and should be thrown out.

3. Smell good and have good breath.

4. Don't drink too much. I usually only have two drinks on a date. It also leads to a good line of, ""I'm not looking to drink anymore but I am keen to keep hanging out if you want to come to my place."" People say a girl needs an excuse to come back I. E. Come see my antique Xylophone that I told you about . But I've found just saying this works more often than it doesn't.

5. Condoms. Wear them. It doesn't get mentioned much here but after a touch of chlamydia I thought I would reiterate it. Girl who gave it to me was an upper middle class architect. So, you know, it can be anyone.

6. Have wine in the fridge all the time. Can be cheap shit. Go buy 10 bottles of piss and keep it handy. It's a good excuse to hangout in the apartment. Not for first dates but for second onward. Skip the bar and have her round for wine, if you are late 20s or older and fucking younger girls they like this. A girl under 25 being invited round for a glass of wine makes her feel like a sophisticated grown up. A 21 year old told me this. 

7. Create the picture of a life she wants to be part of. So, girls don't do shit. Generally speaking they have no hobbies beyond texting. They are looking for a guy to show them stuff and take them places or just have things going on. I have a lot of friends. They are cool interesting people. I talk about them on dates. ""Ah that reminds me of something my mate Matt was telling me. This is a fairly disgusting end to a Tinder date story. You in?"" Tell your friends stories. Be someone who seems to hangout with all these awesome and hilarious people. I've travelled the world a fair bit and I find the stories about my friends have more of an impact than any story of trekking through the Vietnamese jungle etc. 

8. Shit tests. I'll agree and amplify if the vibe is right and we are fucking with each other. If we don't have that vibe (yet) and it comes over as her just being mean or being a bitch. I ignore it completely. Act like she didn't even talk. It works better than anything I've tried. A girl had a party at her place. I'd met her that day from tinder and she invited me to the party. At some point she says to me, ""You are maybe half as funny as you think you are."" I saw a girl heading out the door and said, ""are you going to the store? I'll come too, need some more beers."" Then just walked off. So this party hosting girl was some big feminist and would give me shit tests all night, constant nonsense and social justice crap. I ignored each and every one of them. Just started a new conversation with someone else. She wasn't getting the argument she obviously craved. Whenever she was nice, she got attention. She figured it out and stopped being a dick. Depriving her of attention was the worst thing that could happen to her it seemed. She was hot and a lot of her friends seemed like male feminists I. E. Skinny and desperate to please her. We had sex when the party ended.

9. It's an old one here but it is so so true. Text for logistics only. Do. Not. Validate. Her. By. Text. She should have to work for those feelings of attention. Don't let her get her dopamine hit lying on the couch texting you and 6 other dudes. Once I have fucked a girl a few times then I don't mind some bullshit by text. Memes. Links to stuff we have talked about etc. To be perfectly honest if you are doing all this stuff right and sleeping with 3 or 4 different girls on top of having a productive life..... You really won't have time to go back and forward on text.

10. When it comes to the number scale and girls I've found some stuff. Ask out YOUR 10s. So, I had a weird thing for a while. I had no problem asking out a 7. But when I saw a 9/10 I would be intimidated. My 10s are real thin Balkan / Russian looking girls. That's what I am about. Tiny frames. Small tits. So I'd ask out anyone that wasn't them basically as I ""wasn't ready for that."" Turns out.... They aren't everyone's 10. There was this one chick I thought was incredible. My friend likes gym girls. Thiiiiickkkkkk ones. The girl I liked? He thought she was below average. Right...... I should just ask then because if she is a 6 to him and I'm not scared of 6s let's do it. Sometimes YOUR 10s say yes. Ask em. 

11. I have taken loads from here but the one thing I want to give back is that none of it matters. It's just not that big a deal. On this run I've had sex with the hottest women I've ever been with. No 10s. But a a solid run of 7-9. Some stupid good runs as well. 5 in 5 days and things. Know what I felt? At first, excited. Then....... Tired. Then bored of talking to girls. The sex was fine. Good even. Sometimes excellent. But largely inconsequential. I know I can do it now so I actually do it less. I passed up fucking some girl the other night so that I could play PUBG after training. I took a great feeling of pride in doing what I wanted like that. Previously I'd never pass up a chance to go meet a girl. And of course the ridiculous thing is now that I'm willing to pass it up..... They want to fuck more. I'm happy to feel that. I hope if you aren't there that you will feel it one day. I'm actually open to another LTR now. I've met a girl who seems cool and I like being around. If it works great. If not then I know I can go back to living like this. Either is fine. Both have a lot fun moments. That confidence likely makes it way more likely to work I think. Who knows. We're all dying anyway.

Many blessings to you all. I wouldn't dare attempt to field questions. I'm just some idiot who has got ok at getting laid when desired. Hopefully we can chat a bit though and maybe see what other bullet points people add.",982,0.0,0.34439998865127563,"girl, feel, really, find, still, shit, male, always, leave, relationship"
983,78n3am,"I've recently rediscovered this fantastic sub and wanted to offer some hopefully important advice to those in their twenties and even late teens. Although I am learning every single day I feel like since turning this age my outlook and opinions have dramatically changed. I want to offer these as I go along:

**Chasing Women is a waste of time** Luckily Tinder etc is the norm. Women do not disappear they are always there. Always. If desperate for a bang, drop your standards. But do not under any circumstances focus on it. Yes I got laid a lot, not as much as I wanted to however they are memories you share with your buddies over a beer, and they make you smile for about 1 minute. Thats it. But what I will say is get it out of your system. Fuck around, fuck an asian girl. Fuck a spanish one. Have a ONS. Do it, enjoy it. Then you'll know when you don't have the energy for it anymore that its out of your system unlike the beta that settles for any thing, and you can chill with a respectable LTR. 

**Lack of Goals = Lack of Improvement** WRITE YOUR GOALS DOWN. All of them, and set yourself realistic targets. Do not just say ""I want to lose weight"" say ""i want to lose 5kg in 2 months. Those who do not have clearly defined goals are wandering lost souls. Write your goals down, and stick to them. This will bring you greater pleasure then getting laid a lot trust me. Do not be a male bimbo.

**Going out every weekend** Biggest waste of money, time, energy and so on. I have stayed in on weekends for last 2 years half of it single and had the time of my life. Maybe cos Im 30 but seriously I do not recall one night that was ""life changing"" and so on. Its a load of shit and in the antisocial socialist heavy society we live in most people are insecure assholes in bars etc. So really think about it, on your days off/weekends why would you choose to go to a place full of people that are a bunch of cunts? Go to dinner, get a hobby, improve yourself, work on a project, even play a video game that you can improve on. Going out is finished. Again nobody on their deathbed ever remembers the night they go to the bar full of average to sexy looking women who were rude or might have fucked you. 

**Invest** Real estate, shares, anything that produces income. Do not invest in something that gives you no dividends. Its a load of bullshit.

**There will always be another job, but not another life** If you need income, work, but if you want to be successful work for yourself. I realised at 23 that my bosses at all my jobs were no smarter than me, and I refused to ever work for another incompetent asshole again. Funnily enough 7 years later each one of those bosses have either been fired, company closed or quit. You got one life, do whatever the fuck you want on YOUR terms.

**Do not go to College* Unless you are studying law or medicine, DO NOT BOTHER. Do not get yourself into THOUSANDS of debt, for a piece of paper. Im a college dropout, zero debt, worked for myself, whereas others I know cant even fucking go out as they are crippled with student loans. Do not do it, youre only doing it for the social life, and again thats a bubble not worth staying in for that amount of debt.

**Friends come and go** Seriously the friends I have now to before are chalk and cheese. If you dont like a dude, do not hang out with them. Also like to add, do not socialise with women. They are at their worst right now and are selfish beyond belief. Those who are lucky to use them to get laid etc well done, but majority of us have never been so fortunate. They offer you nothing good at all and I havent had a female friend (that i wasnt banging) for 3 years. Couldnt be happier.

**Assume bullshit** I believed everything I was ever told. We live in a bullshit heavy society. Do not believe a single word. None of it. Whether its in business or socially. Assume bollocks, smile, nod and don't give a fuck.

**Its easier to make money for yourself then ever** A guy I know had no money, no prospects got a business loan and paid it off in 13 months selling fucking burgers for a stand and is looking to expand. Seriously, take the hit, totally worth it.

**Get dumped/Break up** Greatest life lesson ever. Best painful experience too. If you've never had this, you've never lived.

**Delete all social media** Biggest waste of time ever, use it ONLY for trying to bang a girl or promote your business. Anything beyond that do not bother.

**Take the risk** Invest the money, ask her out, do something stupid, put a lot on red, but all within minimum. Ive gone extreme on all this, I've lost a lot of money, Ive done plenty stupid things, i put a lot on red and black came up. Don't regret any of it, lifes too short. But be warned do not overstretch yourself. Dont put it ALL on red, eggs in one basket and so on.

Last but not least **Do whatever YOU want** Your family, friends, spouse, teachers, boss do not know you. They think they do, but they are fucking stupid. You know you, and only you can do what you think is right. Trust your heart, but not what you think your dad would like etc. I'm telling you to be selfish because its not their lives its YOUR lives. 

You can honestly achieve anything in your lives. Seriously, the amount of shit wankers told me and I proved them all wrong is the greatest feeling ever. I want you to know that you will be hated for all of this because it goes completely against the grain. But thats what this sub is about. Its about becoming the man you always wanted to be.

Women are so turned around that they think the path to happiness is by acting like a man.

**The Modern Woman:** *I will become highly educated. I will build a successful career and make lots of money. I will have sex with as many partners as I can*

Women who enter their masculine frame and start acting like men end up miserable and lonely. We all know it, and we clearly see it playing out in society.

But there is a much more nefarious and less-frequently discussed phenomenon that I find much more disturbing.

Vagina envy.

Men are cutting off their own balls, their own masculinity, and acting like they wish they had a vagina.

**The Modern Man:** *I can't wait to find a chick to settle down with. I will sit around doing nothing meaningful with myself, praying for Mrs. Right to save me from my boring life. I want to cuddle on the couch with her and whisper sweet nothings. My greatest ambition in life is to find the Right One.*

985,7ykxcy,"Perhaps one of the most elementary and hindering mistakes we make in life is to assume a linear relationship between events and causes in life. The reality is that linearity is not the norm. The 80/20 rule is simply a byproduct of the power laws, logarithmic and exponential tendencies of many of life's happenings. 
In this post, I  will explain 80/20 and how to leverage it in all areas of your life, because life is too short to be a chump. 

[**Watch This**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPwJmtACUO4)

##**What is 80/20?**

The 80/20 rule also known as the Pareto principle or the law of the vital few, is a principle that states that roughly 80% of results are generated from 20% of efforts.

It’s a distribution that was uncovered by an Italian economist named Vilfredo Pareto. Pareto noticed that 80% of the land in Italy at the time was owned by 20% of the population. He also noticed the principle at work in his own garden! 20% of the pea pods contained 80% of the peas. This distribution has been proven multiple times in different sectors since its discovery.

The ratio is not always 80/20, it can be skewed all the way to 99/1 or even bigger ratios.The main idea is that a small number of critical causes tend to produce the biggest effects in almost all area in life. What is important is being able to identify these causes and leverage them to your benefit. 

**Examples of 80/20**

In the video linked above, I go through 3 examples in real time, clearly showing the consistency of 80/20.  The examples I use are The worlds GDP, the population of cities in Australia ( where I am from), and analytics on my own YouTube channel.  ( make sure to check that out ) 

Some common examples often mentioned in the 80/20 discussion are how:

• 20% of criminals commit 80% of crimes ( Think of convicts that keep returning to prison ) 

• 20% of employees account for 80% of the companies success ( Just look at any sales team to see this in action)
 
• You wear 20% of your clothes 80% of the time (you dirty fucker, change your shirt) 

• You walk on 20% of your carpet 80% of the time ( the walk from your bed to the fridge )

• You spend 80% of your time with only 20% of your friends

I must stress that the ratio isn’t always 80/20, but it’s almost always something skewed. 


##**Why does 80/20 happen?**

The 80/20 distribution happens because of the magic of feedback loops. Many people who have owned goldfish can attest to the following observation. You go to the pet store and buy 3 equal sized goldfish; a couple months roll by and the 3 goldfish are drastically different in size. Why is that? Well, naturally when you first fed the goldfish one might have been lucky enough to eat a bit more food than the others. This extra food allows the goldfish to grow slightly larger than the other goldfish giving it a slight advantage when it came to eating food. Over time this advantage gets larger and more obvious until the other goldfish can barely compete, and you are left with one big fat goldfish that just eats all the food the same way that your cousin David does at every family gathering the fat fucker.

Now replace the goldfish with Google or Microsoft and you can see how monopolies are formed. Other factors are involved of course, but this seems to be one of the primary reasons for the ratio. 

##**How to leverage 80/20 Examples for the real world**

Now that you know about the magic of 80/20, let’s go over ways that you can optimise your life using this simple principle. 80/20 is a mindset, being able to see through everything through this mindset will drastically improve your results in all avenues.


##**Fitness:**

Two best friends decide to join the gym to build some juicy muscles and make the king of Iron Arnold proud. 
One of the boy’s trains 6 times a week and focuses on isolating each muscle with specialised movements. He does an hour of cardio after each workout in hopes of getting ripped. He works out for an average of 12 hours per week. He doesn’t worry too much about his diet, and has never counted his calories.
The second boy takes a more minimalistic approach, he does full body workouts 3 times a week focusing on heavy compound exercises that stimulate his whole body. He does cardio only once a week and prefers to focus on high-intensity interval training such as hill sprints. He focuses on the diet keeping track of his daily macronutrient requirements. He only works out 4  hours per week.
Who will achieve their goals faster? The second boy will. He will make more gains because he puts all his effort in the 20% of things that will result in 80% of the results. Instead of spending 12 hours in the gym like his friend, he stimulates his body effectively and gives it plenty of rest resulting in insane gains. 




##**Work:**

Jim works in a sales department. He spends most of his days performing small tasks that are delegated to him. he replies to every email and is quick to give anyone his time. Unfortunately, due to the workload, Jim only spends one hour of his day performing cold calls. He has been working hard for a couple of years doing everything his boss command, however, has been unable to create the results needed to be eligible for a promotion.

Ray works in the same sales department as Jim. He spends most of his time at work cold calling clients. He doesn’t reply to most of his email. When he uses email it’s only to deal with potential clients or critical tasks. Ray does not have time to chit-chat with co-workers. To him, if something is a non-critical task it can be delegated to someone else. Through his time spent on client acquisition, he has managed to secure 6 figure deals, making his boss very happy. Ray doesn’t complete half of the tasks in his job description but gets promotions regardless.

Ray is successful because of his understanding of the 80/20 rule. Jim is not successful because he treats all tasks with equal weighting.

##**Relationships:**

You are divorced from your wife and can only spend one day out of the week with you Son, what do you do? Is it better to watch TV with him for a couple of hours or to go outside and do something? Think about this, we forget probably around 99% of our lives. The day to day shenanigans quickly disappears into the ether. Don’t believe me? Can you remember what you did throughout one whole day a month ago? No, we only remember things of significance such going away on that trip, or your sister’s wedding. Now back to your son, if your goal is to optimize your relationship with him, you are probably better off going fishing with him or shooting a few hops at the park. These things are will be the 20% that equals 80% of the memories he remembers with you. 

##**Education:**

I remember having a project management class for my engineering degree. Our assignment was to do a presentation in front of the whole class. A couple of my friends spent weeks and hours researching for the assignment. Come due day, all they presented was a dense and boring death by powerpoint slide. 

I was to present the week after, I decided to take a different approach and look at the criteria of the assignment. I noticed that presentation skills such as eye contact, and vocal tonality scored high. I also remembered the professor telling us that our slides should be simple. So, my team and I decided to focus on simple and entertaining slides that got to the point quicker. We didn’t use palm cards and remembered our speeches making them far more engaging. A total of 8 hours was spent on the presentation and we received the highest mark in the class.  


**80/20 everything**

To maximize your efficiency in life you must always be looking for the 20% that will give you 80% of the results. When you find these double down on them, make them your primary focus. As Tim Ferriss suggests, always ask yourself

*‘what is the one thing that I can do that will make everything else irrelevant’,*
It might be cold calling new customers
It might be eliminating soda drinks from your diet. 
Make it your mission in life to always look for these 20%, those motherfuckers are the true game changers.

The fellows in the comments gave me enough mistrust to decide that perhaps I should check her messages right when she left the room (something I wouldn't normally do, because I trusted her), but almost like clockwork, I found a group message with her and her friends, with her talking about how she wants to fuck this guy in her study group, a guy that was previously flirting with her over text and when I confronted her about it before, she claimed that she didn't think it was flirting and that she could handle herself.

In any case, right when she came back in the room I confronted her about it and she tried to rationalize it in some absurd ways, but needless to say I said ""we're done"" and walked out right there. She's been trying to call me and knock on my door and shit, but I'm just keeping up no contact.

*****
**The First Conversation**
My daughter's mom called me early in the morning to tell me she was pregnant.  She asked me what she should do.  This question is testing you in a lot of different ways.  Are you going to freak out?  Are you going to try to convince her to get an abortion?  The correct answer is to say, in a calm and confident manner, for her to start taking prenatal vitamins.  If you want an abortion you have weeks to talk about it.  This is an easy question to knock out of the park.  If she decides to have a child she can NEVER use against you that you wanted an abortion.  When shit goes downhill she will throw you under the bus to everyone she knows.  Give her as little ammunition as possible.  Reason: You will need to maintain frame in a way that you've never had to for a length of time that seems impossible.  When you know what she's saying is not true it makes it easier to suffer the slings and arrows. In my case I could tell immediately that abortion was not a live option and that I would be left in the dark for the next 9 months if I brought it up.  But I should add that I would never abort a child as a form of birth control

**Week 1** - Start saving 20% of your income for a safe new car.  Well, that's what I told by daughter's mom.  I told everyone that actually.  It would have been great, but I knew then that it was unlikely.  Really what I was doing is saving 20% of my income to see what child support was going to be like AND for attorney fee's.  I spent every dime so far.  Start saving immediately.  Hope for the best, plan for the worst.

**On Child Support** - That money is simply no longer yours.  Do not argue about it or whine or try to get out of it.  She might even tell you she doesn't want it.  Do not take the bait.  Force her hand.  Require her to take the money.  There are other methods to avoid paying your full legal obligation.  But you MUST *play the perfect courtier* from the very beginning.  Your end goal is to have a congruent story. If you want to argue philosophically about how it's immoral or whatever post on this site.  In America It's like arguing with gravity.  It makes you look like a fucking moron.  My strategy was to just immediately give her the ground.  No need for her to fight it.  Why?  *Assume Formlessness.*   In the future she will try to hurt you.  She will have learned a lot about what hurts you.  You will never be hurt the way a pregnant woman can hurt you.  She has so much power over you (due to the laws in this country) that you will break.   A year later she is still using what she knows hurts me to try to hurt me now.   Fortunately I *Controlled the Options.*

**Week 2** Tell her that you're getting a paternity test through the courts.  Not a walgreen's kit.  She will understandably be outraged at the implication.  Tell her early before you guys get to know each other and just say casually that you two are strangers.  Ask her if she trust you 100% already.  Tell her it's a legal requirement for setting up child support (half true).  When I did this, it really wasn't that big of a deal.  

**Week 3-5ish** *Plan all the way to the end* and *Know who you are dealing with*  Pregnancy amplifies whatever is wrong with a girl.  Obviously she is not a princess if she hooked up with a stranger. It should put a huge spotlights on her specific brand of crazy.  Between September and October I knew her fairly well.  I knew she wanted to be a ""heroic single mom.""  I knew she had an avoidant attachment style.  She was an insane control freak.  She gave me faux options to manipulate me into thinking I had a choice in the matter.  She told me before we knew the gender that my child would not have my last name and that there was nothing I could do about it.  The anguish and pain that caused me could not be hidden.  I told her that we were not in agreement on this issue but she told me that I would have to deal with it and tough shit.  My brain said she was right, there was nothing I could do because I was powerless. *Use the Surrender Tactic: Transform Weakness into Power* and than later *Play a Sucker to Catch a Sucker – Seem Dumber than your Mark*  In any dispute where you have no power you shouldn't argue with her, just state that you are not in agreement on this issue and drop it.  You will pay an attorney to argue with her in the future.  

**6 months of hell** I went to every doctor's appointment she invited me to.  I did everything she wanted including signing a lease with her.  It was her idea, but I saw how I could use it to my advantage. I think at this point she was trying to get me to say no to something so she could go tell everyone want a terrible dude I was.  But my rationale was this: Best case scenario when she moves out after a year I could argue that child lives at that house and is off breast milk, emergency placement prior to court is usually the residence that the child knows best.  Worst case scenario - I had signed a lease with a girl I wasn't even dating, that's how invested in my child's life I was.  Make sure you can afford to pay for the entire rent yourself before signing the lease. MAKE SURE SHE SIGNS THE LEASE.  My daughter's mom tried to get out of signing it.  Nope, her name is on that shit.  Which will prevent her from claiming you raped her.... but who would do that.


**Last three months**- Mom moved out due to me being a manipulative, uncaring, slob (her words).  We had one fight while living together and nothing she said was true.  She was just looking for a reason to move out.  She refused to talk to me for the last three months of the pregnancy.  I really think her issue is that she knew she wasn't controlling me.  We didn't talk for three months.  

In those three months I focused on *Concentrating my Forces*.  I had told my daughter's mom that my parents were moving here to help us out. This has helped me so much in my fight to get visitation so far. My sister lives in town, my brother lives in town, and now both my parents were available at all times to baby sit.  I also went lawyer shopping over the three month period.  www.avvo.com   I talked to five different lawyers. 

**I make this sound easy:** I haven't mentioned about how my health declined due to stress.  It was the worst when I signed the lease with her.  Huge gamble unknown whether it was foolish or if it would pay off.  My vision started changing every single day (Eye doctor tried saying I had type II diabetes), Bald spots appeared in my beard, blood pressure went into type II hypertension.  I spent more on doctor bills in six months than my entire adult life.  Hang in there man.  Find a support group, coworkers, family members.  Lean on people but remember that they want to see a success story.  Females at work always love to hear about a father fighting to stay in their childrens' lives.

**You have no rights** Before the paternity test you have no rights.  Zero.  You must continue to use the surrender tactic.  You are literally a random stranger to that kid.  Do not sign a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity.  If you have a good lawyer he delivered the court order BEFORE your child was born to do a paternity test.  I was the father by the way.

**Mom Fights Back**  Oh man she will fight as if her life depends on it.  Her maternal instinct to protect that child from people she doesn't trust/like is going to make her behave like a crazy person. She tried to fight the paternity test.  She didn't let me see my daughter for three weeks over father's day and then acted like it was my own fault.  Bite your tounge.  You still have a ways to go. Do NOT fight with the mom.  Ever.  You arguing with Mom is a waste of breath.  You pay an attorney to fight her.  *Win through your Actions, Never through Argument*  No matter what she did to me I didn't let it phase me.  I made sure the courts knew what she did so that we could have a congruent case of her denying me visitations.  The day I was declared the father through the paternity test Mom filed serious endangerment charges against me.  At first she was alleging that I raped her.  But that lease she signed with me destroyed that option.  My attorney BCCed me on emails so I basically read his response as, ""are you joking?  This is a joke.  She signed a lease with him.""  So she went with a whole shit ton of mud instead.  None of it true.  The courts MUST investigate so don't take it personally ($$$ $$ because of the Children $$$$).  Play the perfect courtier.  Remember you don't care about money, only about bonding with your child.     My Attorney was 1500, the supervised visits cost me 1200$, the guardiam ad litem cost me 1400$.  I never brought up that she filed this, never yelled at her for it.  Just imagine you're playing chess.  She made a move, it's your job to anticipate it and counter it.  It's easy to counter.   

**Guardiam Ad Litem** She is the only person you care to win over.  Play the perfect courtier.  Play the perfect courtier.  Play the perfect courtier.  The GAL relies on the supervisor that is watching you with your daughter.  Treat the supervisor like an old friend.  Listen to their stories of other ""crazy"" parents.  Mom won't like the supervisor because she's not in control, someone else is in control. To the GAL, compliment Mom on her mothering abilities.  Never trash talk her, don't ever say anything emotionally charged about her.  Say you're only complaint is that she won't let you or your family see your daughter.  Say you just want to be equals as parents.    I remember distinctly saying, ""four hours a week is just not enough, it's just not enough""  to which she echo'd me.  Mine had a questionnaire for me to fill out and I spent 8 hours writing and rewriting it until it was the perfect.  I had painted a picture, that was true, whereby Mom has mud on her by the end and yet you never saw me throw anything and my hands remained clean.  

By the next court date I had the Guadian Ad Litem telling me she was going to try to get me 50/50 joint custody.  It helped me out a lot that I actually liked both the supervisor handling my case and the GAL. I knew immediately they would be able to see through Mom's ridiculous behavior if I just continued to maintain frame and play the perfect courtier. I could tell they were both good people.  Your mileage may vary and you will get GAL who are in it for the money.  My attorney went out of his way to get this GAL.  I didn't do this at the time but absolutely research reviews online for the GAL.  The GAL is actually more important than the attorney you get.  Tell your attorney that you want a GAL who has a reputation for acting in the child's best interest.  The supervisor handling my case also if you talk to her will gossip about the reputations of all the attorneys involved in your case.

**False Allegations** First the serious endangerment charges, next Mom will record every way that you're not doing a good job as a parent (in her mind).  Yes it annoys you to have to answer to everything you do with your time but it's annoying the Guardian ad litem too.  My favorite thing to say to the GAL is this, ""She has never brought it up to me, if I'm doing something wrong I want to know.  Why wouldn't she tell me?""  Play the perfect courtier.  When I won my first major battle I got the best false allegation of the year.  Mom came over and tried to start a fight with me.  She had nothing to go on and I have now never argued with her for 15 months.  Why would I start now?  Long story short she went postal while I remained calm.  She started hitting my door, etc.  She left and called the police.  Police showed up to ask me some questions.  The moment you prepare for finally happens (you are prepared for the police getting called on you when you start winning in court right?).  I simply tell him I don't answer questions without an attorney.  Bye bye sir. That was now 7 days ago and I've heard nothing from the police.  This is where maintaining frame comes into play.  It's so important, remember you're doing it for your child.  

**Assume Formlessness/Control the Options** Mom wants to hurt me.  But she never correctly figured out how.  She thought the only option for hurting me was to deny me visitations but that's because I controlled her options.  I put her in a position where her choices were to not attack me and let me visit my daughter and thus I win, or to attack me and (when I'm exonerated) it makes her look bad and thus I win.  She had a lot of options to waste my money and give me tons of time with my daughter (when I was paying someone to supervise me).  This would have made her look good and done a great deal of damage to me.  She never did it because she didn't realize it would hurt me.  From the beginning I acted like money was not a big deal and would constantly just spend it in front of her like I had an endless supply of it.  I would tell stories that carried the message that IDGAF about money.

**Present day** By this point no one in court believes her anymore.  I went into court thinking that she was going to get to file an order of protection but I think that even her own attorney must have advised against it.  I had my first overnight with my daughter.  This week.  I'm confident that she tarnished her reputation and they see that she's just hyper controlling and will fabricate things about me to maintain that control.  She doesn't know how to hurt me or control me (well controlling me would be easy, she just could try being nice to me). The best part is that soon I will have 50/50 custody which reduces my child support obligation (that thing I supposedly don't care about).  My attorney says that he has gotten surname changed and that there is a good likelihood (depending on the judge) that this also will come about.
*****
Guys you can win in court.  It's hard and unfair and we're not used to being discriminated against so obnoxiously.  We're not used to being guilty until proven innocent.  I constantly let Mom think she's smarter than me.  I play dumb constantly with her.  I never engage her.  I pretend like I don't know what's going on and that my attorney doesn't communicate with me very well.  I pretend like it's no big deal that she says crazy stuff about me.  I never ever ever ever gloat or rub it in or try to hurt her back.  She's a child, you're an adult.  If she knows what's going on in your brain the fight will never end.  Moves and countermoves guys.  It can be done.  It will affect your health.  I jumped out of an airplane and was so depressed I felt absolutely nothing.  There were days I woke up where I did not think I could do it; I didn't think I had the stamina for this type of warfare.  The toxicity from Mom was that intense.  The odds seemed to be stacked against me to too great of a degree.  You can do it if you must.  

*Edit:*  By the way, I forgot to mention this in the beginning but I really always ""hoped for the best, plan for the worst""  That was my strategy.  If you read through all of this you'll really see that it's obvious.  I genuinely hoped that Mom would figure out that I have my family in my best interest and that she could trust me.  Every step of the way I gave her the option of doing the right thing with no repercussion.  She just never took that option; I don't harp on it as it's probably never going to be relevant.  But as you try to win the hearts and minds of others make sure that you emphasize how you hope for the best and what you're doing (saving for a safe car, signing a lease with a stranger to raise your child together, going to all doctors appointments, etc.)  

*2nd Edit:* I should also mention this guide pertains to a non-substance abusing mother.  This is about getting your rights from a mom with no real issues.  I am so fortunate and happy that I don't have to worry about any actual harm going to my daughter.  Like if you remind yourself how much worse things could be, it makes it easier to remain stoic in the face of America's court system.

*3rd Edit:* Some typos's etc.  I have a paternity test guys.  It's in the story. Yes, I'm intelligent.  I am the type of guy that would never make a mistake.  I was drunk and I honestly just fucked up.  If it happened to me, it'll probably happen to other guys out there so I wrote this guide.  If you don't want to be a part of your child's life than you don't really need a guide.  Personally I couldn't leave my daughter to be raised without a father knowing everything I know about TRP.

**No. Thank You TRP** A lot of you guys are thanking me for writing this.  I'd like to say instead thanks to all of you.  The only, ONLY, reason I was prepared for all the false allegations, the toxicity, the back stabbery, the nonsense, the insanity, and the court system was you all and this community.  Very few guys naturally would ever think the way I was forced to think.  I was never flatfooted on ANYTHING she did because I was able to anticipate it months in advance (false rape allegations, domestic disputes with the police, etc) and thanks to you guys I knew how important maintaining frame was throughout all of this.  So while many of you don't agree with everything I did or get focused on the one time in my life I had unprotected sex (with a stranger), I don't mind the criticism because I never said that this guide was the ONE way to do it.  There is probably a better strategy.  I did waste a lot of energy on things that were absolute wastes of time.

988,7z3u1z,"This story is a couple months old, but I just saw it. An army colonel was about to be promoted to general when some random blogger accused him of raping her like 30 fucking years ago. The army yanked his promotion and started an investigated that found no proof, but his career was over. Can you imagine that shit?

He sued her for defamation and was awarded $3.4 million for lost wages and reputation damage and $5 million (!!!!) for punitive damages. Apparently the punitive damages in this state are limited to $350K and the overall damages will probably be reduced to around $2 million, but wow this is still a huge win.

He proved that every part of her story literally could not have happened. The jury was composed of three men and four women. They deliberated for 2.5 hours, but the entire deliberation was over the amount of the damages. They all unanimously agreed after their initial poll that she was liable. One juror said that they awarded the punitive damages ""to make sure that something like this could never happen again.""

Edit: Oh and after the army's investigation found no evidence against him, his name was put forward again for promotion but Obama's scumbag Army Secretary still denied it. Unreal what that man did to the country.

Edit 2: Been getting some flak for my first edit because I said that Obama's Army Secretary denied the promotion and it is against sub rules to discuss politics. Sorry.... I guess? I didn't attack liberal tax policy or foreign policy. I attacked their sexual assault policy.

I'm not sure how the politics can really be disentangled from this case. One party has been driving this almost exclusively, and one party decided to create a situation in academia and in the military where one unfounded accusation on someone's blog ends your career/education in order to win more votes from women. That's the reality. If reality makes you uncomfortable, there are a few other subs I can recommend for you to check out such as Two X Chromosomes or The Blue Pill.

If any of the mods think this breaks the rules I will remove the offending paragraph.

Edit 3: There's a bit of confusion in the comments that people are saying ""glad he was acquitted,"" or ""why wasn't she jailed for lying,"" etc. I'd like to give a 10 cent civics lesson for those who maybe aren't from the US or don't fully understand the legal system. I'm not a lawyer. Please feel free to correct me if you are and I've made a mistake.

In the US and other countries that get their legal traditions from the English, there are two types of trials, criminal and civil. In a criminal trial, the people through their government bring charges against a person for breaking a law. At the trial the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that you committed the crime to the jury. If the jury returns a guilty verdict, then you are punished by the state with fines, community service, probation, prison, or even death.

In a civil trial, one private citizen or corporation sues another private citizen or corporation (government can sometimes be sued but not always) for committing a tort against them. They seek to recover monetary damages for being wronged. These torts could be anything from libel/slander like in this case, to medical malpractice, to suing a dog owner if his animal bit you. In a civil trial, the person bringing the suit must show that there is a greater than 50% chance that they are correct (different standard than criminal trial) and also show how they were damaged by the wrongdoing.

If the jury decides in their favor they can then decide how much the damages should be. There are different types of damages that can be awarded. For example in this case the jury awarded him $3.4 million for lost wages and for damage to his reputation. This means that the jury believed that the wages he should have made as a general plus the damage to his future earning potential and the personal suffering he endured because of his damaged reputation was worth $3.4 million. They also awarded punitive damages of $5 million. Punitive damages are meant to punish the defendant and deter future behavior like this. Again note that the actual judgement was almost certainly reduced by the judge to around $2 million. This seems to be a pretty common theme in civil trials.

Some are asking why she is not in prison for making a false charge. She never made any official charge against him. She just put some words on her blog. Some are also asking why she isn't in jail for perjury (lying under oath), since she lost her case. Understand that just because she lost this case, she is not guilty of perjury. The government would have to bring charges against her and conduct a whole new criminal trial to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she lied in her testimony. Simply losing a court case in which you testified is not enough to convict you of perjury, otherwise the loser would be getting hit with a perjury charge after after case.

I had been working for this outfit for about 2 years, and every foreman I had worked with had giving me great reviews.  A position opened up which was basically the same thing I had been doing, but instead of residential work, it would be more on the commercial side.  This new title came with a substantial pay raise and I made it very clear to my bosses that I wanted the job.  A week or so went by and they had me take written tests to see how well I knew everything incumbent to the job, I passed every single test without getting  single answer wrong.  This job was mine.  I busted my ass.  Then I get the word that they hired someone to fill the position.  I was bummed out to say the least, but to make it worse it was someone with no prior experience and I had to train them on how to do the job.  This person happened to be female and day one during training was getting paid almost twice as much as myself.  I didn't take it lightly and requested a meeting with my superiors.  They told me that it was because a quota for minorities had to be filled (even though the person who left and created the vacancy was a white male) and that I should just keep doing what I have been doing and it will all work out for me.  I walked out of that office, thought about it for a minute, walked back in and quit.  I got the job I was looking for at a competing company with in a week.  Like I said I have nothing against the person who got the job, she was eager to learn and do it the right way, but that doesn't mean I had to take it sitting down.

2. Don't change her mind, change her mood.

3. No woman can fix your happiness or be the main source of it. Get your shit together first and improve yourself.

4. Don't deal with a shitty women. Ever.

5. Don't be ashamed of your sexual desires or think that girls don't want sex and have to be 'convinced' into having sex with you. When it comes to sex, men are like an on-off switch, women are like a volume knob.

6. The amount of girls that want their hair pulled, ass slapped, and to be told what to do in bed is astounding.

7. The guys who are banging girls out of their league are doing it because they went for it.

8. Look at how she treats her parents/friends.

9. You need to be BOLD. The sting of rejection is nothing compared to the sting of regret.

10. Don't feed them with compliments, leave it to the betas. Your eyes should do the talking when she dazzles in that dress. 

11. You want to touch her, she wants to be touched. Be unapologetic about it. Talk simultaneously while you do kino.

12. Be ready to walk away from any relationship. This also applies to real life, if something doesn't seem right, walk.

13. Be always less invested than she is. You hold the power.

14. You can't build attraction over text, use texting for logistics. The face to face interaction is what you need to seek.

15. Do not make a woman your goal. You're on your own path and she can just join you. 

16. Don't mate guard.

17. Treat women like human beings, not goddesses.

18. Women treat relationships like men treat jobs. You may have a fine job--decent pay, vacation, just got a promotion, whatever. You're thinking, ""Yeah, I'll probably stick around awhile"". Then somebody comes up and asks if you want to be an astronaut at triple your current pay. You couldn't put in your resignation fast enough.

20. A monkey doesn't let go of the branch its on until it has another branch in hand.

22. If you want true love, get a dog.

23. She's not yours, it's only your turn.

24. Hookers cost less than girlfriends and go away when you tell them to. Just saying.

25. They have their mobile phones near them at ALL times, and i mean ALL, no matter what they are doing (or what is being done to them). if they want to contact you immediately, they can and will. so if you message them and they do not text you back until a few days later, they are deliberately ignoring your ass.

26. It doesn't matter how long you've been with a woman, how many memories you have together, or how much effort you've put in...she will forget you in less than a week and move onto the next guy.

992,e2ldfq,"As I was lifting a ten thousand pound dumbbell high above my head while two sultry blondes licked at my nutsack, I noticed the guy next to me was a bitch! Here he was, at the gym, which is an inherently not bitchy place even if sometimes some retardedly hot piece and her friend start babbling. And, yet, this man was a bitch all the same. He cowered at the sight of masculine men, and women, well, they may as well have been Medusa for how much he avoided looking at them. This couldn't do at all!

My dear boy, I said to him. I am going to help. I am the Ghost of Getting Ass, and I have taken pity on you! Come! We must debitchify you!

The man seemed uncertain as to whether or not he should get onto the motorcycle, so, to aid him, I punched him in the face.

What did you do that for, the man said.

I wagged an alpha finger at him.

 > Don't be uncertain! Uncertainty is the move of women and bitch men. Asses your options, and then do what springs to mind immediately.


The man struggled to get a proper foothold on the bike, and he immediately crashed into a light post.

Don't you know how to ride a bike?

The man shook his head pathetically. I gave him my hand and put him back on the bike, teaching him how.

> Learn Skills and do exciting things! Women are attracted to skill and being good at something exciting and dangerous gets women wetter than ten thousand roses ever could. Women are extremely boring, and you are the exciting instrument that they secretly want to blow.

The man and I rode our motorcycles to some dive bar and began to drink with the other men. The man, now surrounded by pure uncut masculinity, began to loosen up.

She has titties as big as satellite dishes! One man said. And the bar laughed. I turned to the man again.

> Become immersed in masculinity. Once you are surrounded by something you become more comfortable. Like diving into a pool. Once the waters of masculinity become a Haven for you, your adventures with women will become easier.

The man and I left the bar. Time to score some ass!

I saw some Latina bitch with a fine ass walking by and went over and alphaed her until her panties got wet, of course. The man stood behind me, looking at women. He was strutting his chest out and holding his head high.

I stopped talking to the Latina.

What the fuck are you doing, faggot?

I'm being alpha, the man replied, I read a post about alpha body language and i-

I punched his flabby jaw.

Stop it. 

> You can act as alpha as you want, but beautiful women need to be approached. They have incredibly low self-esteem and are insecure. They could not handle it if you rejected them. And so they don't apporach. They are a lot like most of you, a bitch, afraid of even the slightest bit of bumps in the road.

The man finnaly grew a big set of balls, and went up and talked to a woman. 

H-hi...

Dear God what is he doing, but then I remembered patience. Not so long ago I was a beta faggot who wouldn't know what to do with a pussy if it was gift wrapped and sent to my door.

I-i thought you were cute and I wanted to say hi.

I have a boyfriend, the bitch replies.

Oh, I'm sorry, ok bye.


The man walks away.

I grab him by the arm.
Hey, that was pretty shite but at least now you know one thing.

> Rejection is better than regret.


The night is over, and the man goes to his 9-5. I follow along, floating beside him like the alpha Spectre that I am. He slacks off at his job, and constantly shoots glances at Karen, the funky bitch with the back tattoo in HR. As he goes to the urinal for his procrastination piss, I give him a solid jab to the ear.

Hey retard.

> Money is more important than women. Start paying more attention to your bank account and less towards whores.


The man is done and drives home, listening to some classic rock garbage that every department store plays to brainwash you into buying heaters. 

Are you going to the gym now, you haven't gone today, I say to him.

He shakes his head.

I, uh, went yesterday and besides I think I'm gonna switch to calisthenics, it's a more- 

I spit in his eye


> The gym is your church, and if you are a good Christian man you don't just go on Sundays. You go to every pot luck, every meeting, and keep your body strong.

After lifting weights, the man begins to play videogames with his online friends. After about an hour I relieve myself on his XBONE or whatever the fuck.

Hey what the hell man, he shouts. Dont piss on my stuff!

I piss on his shoes now.


Listen faggot!

> Video games aren't a skill and if you play it for longer than an hour you are atrophying away. Their is a world full of fresh pussy waiting to be dined upon, and we, the last alphas in this bluepill dystopia, must endeavor to dine on it.


The man now sits mindlessly on his phone.

Don't you have any hobbies, I ask. 

The man says yes, but upon closer inspection it appears his hobby is smoking weed and jacking off.

I look over to his closet.

Boxing gloves, a parachute, dancing shoes, a fencing sword or whatever the fuck it's called.

I then realize his problem.


> Find hobbies and stick to them. Nothing ever comes easy at first, but you risk becoming a boring and retarded loser if you don't do anything.

The man is now finally looking good and approaches a woman the right way for the first time.

I don't usally do this she says

I don't believe he responds suavely.

I'd tell you how to approach a woman the right way, but their are over 100 posts about it. Here's what you should remember.

> Take risks with women, as my uncle Vasily says, faint heart never fucked fair lady.

Finally, the man is back at his room with a woman. As he fucks, I hover over him giving him the thumbs up ocassionly. Felt like highschool running trains again.

A final rule.

> Betas fuck like in movies. If ur alpha u go for the kidneys with every pump, grabbing a handful of neck while you do so.


The man nuts all over the girls face.

He turns to me.

But Visible, I feel so empty. Did I do all this work for this momentary satisfaction.

No. Go look in the mirror.


And their, he sees himself, a healthy, strong, masculine man, who is happy with his life.

And finally he understands.

> The Redpill isn't about women, it's about you. And making you a better version if yourself. Women are a secondary thing. You, are what is important. And as you improve, you shall become happier.

And with that, I fly off to teach some new beta how to be alpha.",992,4.0,0.4715000092983246,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
993,27dzrm,"About once every month or two, there’s a post somewhere on Reddit, by a woman, saying something like, “My boyfriend suddenly started doing Red Pill stuff and now I want out,” followed by 4-6 paragraphs explaining how her boyfriend is now a controlling, abusive asshole who works out and wants sex (because these traits are, of course, very, very unique to The Red Pill, and any guy who exhibits them obviously went online, found us, and we ruined him). These threads get seized upon by our detractors, who eagerly point out: “See? See!? The Red Pill doesn’t ‘work’ ! It just ends relationships and turns guys into assholes!”

Independent of what is and is not actually “Red Pill behavior,” situations like these are based a bad assumption. Simply put, in examples like this, the lamenting woman has presupposed that prior to her man’s “changes”, their relationship was actually good, and he was actually happy. Then he ruined everything by reading some bullshit online that told him how his relationship ought to be, then trying to implement it.

This begs the question: If the relationship was fine before the boyfriend went all Red Pill on his woman, why is he trying to change things? Why did he go on the internet and seek out the manosphere? If he’s happy with his relationship the way it is, why is he trying to find ways to improve his sex life and become more assertive?  (All of this, of course, assumes that a) the stories presented on Reddit are true; and b) the man actually sought out The Red Pill and didn’t just stop kissing his girlfriend’s ass for any number of other reasons.)

The Red Pill is here because men aren’t happy. They don’t want to be sweet and sensitive and do things for women all day long and be the “perfect boyfriend,” while having subpar sex once every six weeks, paying out the ass for expensive dates and gifts, sacrificing personal time, and getting bitched at and threatened with a break-up if any of this perfect behavior ever dips slightly. They don’t want to give backrubs and footrubs, stay at home one weekend a month while their women have a night out with the girls, get disrespected and talked about behind their backs, get cheated on (but just harmless, meaningless mistakes that don’t really count!), and get berated when they push back against any of this. They don’t want to let women move in, rent-free, and get pressured to buy a ring for a four-digit number of dollars and tie their finances to someone who makes less than half as much money, just because they’ve been “dating awhile” and “it’s time” and they’re “supposed to.”

Sure, everything’s hunky-dory for these girlfriends, but for the men, everything is NOT happy. Everything is NOT going well. And men are sick of it.

When a 28-year-old man with an entitled bitch of a girlfriend of 5 years stumbles across the Red Pill, he reads stories about men not so much older than he is who don’t have or want girlfriends. They don’t need a girlfriend because they have four or five women fucking their brains out on a regular basis outside of a relationship. They barely spend a cent on dates or activities. They barely lift a finger to impress women. But girls can’t seem to get enough of them.

And what these men do seems so simple. Work out, focus on your career, practice your social skills and get confident, develop useful skills and interesting hobbies – essentially, quit wasting time. Read non-fiction instead of fiction, watch less TV, play less video games, quit jerking off to porn, spend that time doing something that makes you physically, mentally, or socially better. The Red Pill tells men that their time is valuable, and to use it well. Hand in hand with that, The Red Pill tells men that since their time is their most valuable resource, quit wasting it on women when you’re not getting something of equal value in return. If your girlfriend is ugly, sexually ungenerous, lazy, or just an entitled bitch that expects you to do all kinds of crap for her just to maintain the pleasure of having a girlfriend, is it really worth all of the time and energy you expend? When you could be doing something that actually improves your life?

The Red Pill exists because many men aren’t happy. Because these relationships that are allegedly “just fine” are very much NOT just fine. Because men are giving so much to their women and getting so little, with the assumption that merely existing – merely being a presence in the man’s life – is all a woman needs to do to become his highest priority. That men should be falling over themselves getting in line for the right to say “I have a girlfriend,” and nothing more. Men are sick of this.

Guys in the “my man went Red Pill and ruined our relationship” Reddit posts probably aren’t actually going to internet sites to get an instruction manual for how to piss off their girlfriends. They’re just normal guys who know in the pit of their stomach that something is wrong – that they’re wasting their lives, and that they’re not happy. It’s not their girlfriends’ fault, it’s theirs. And they decide one day, for whatever reason, to try to take control of their lives, of their relationships, and build something they’re actually proud of. And steps 1 and 2 of that process involve asserting yourself and living the way you want, and expecting the people with whom you associate (e.g., your woman) to add value to your life equal to the value you’re expending. The rest of the world shorthands that behavior as “being an asshole,” and “ruining relationships.” How sad is that? Honestly and confidently pursuing the life you want, and expecting others to hold up their end of a relationship is the new Hitler.",993,4.0,0.3465999960899353,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
994,7t9ocm,"##**The Feynman Technique**

The Feynman Technique is a method of learning that is incredibly effective for deep understanding and information retention. How many time have you learned something fast only to forget how to do it weeks later? Maybe it was the Pythagoras theorem, back in high school when you crammed for your math exam. Now when you friend asks you to recite it, all you can do is shrug and say 

***“What the fuck is that? A Harry Potter spell?”***

The problem was that you never learned the thing properly, you simply stored it in the temporary storage section of your brain. This is how many people go about learning, reciting things only to forget them later. 
There is a big difference between knowledge and wisdom, knowledge is having the information, wisdom is knowing how to use it. 

The Feynman Technique is a mental model that will help you gain sufficient wisdom in any endeavour. 
Richard Feynman was a Noble Prize-winning theoretical physicist who was best known for his work in the fields of quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, superfluidity and other groovy shit. To say the least his was a smart dude, he was often called the ‘Great Explainer’ for his uncanny ability to teach complicated principles in layman terms that everybody could understand. 
  Feynman claims that he wasn’t a naturally gifted physicist but managed to make it due to his learning style and hard work. Here is his notorious method for accelerated understanding. 

##**Step One:**

Write the name of a concept that you want to learn about on top of a blank piece of paper. 

##**Step Two:**

Write down an explanation of the concept using plain English. Pretend that you trying to teach it to the slowest person you know or a child. Assume the person has no idea what the hell you are talking about so make sure you cover everything you know simply. 

##**Step Three:**
 
Read over your explanation and take note of the areas in which you are lacking the sufficient knowledge in order to articulate yourself properly. Take note of these areas and return to your source material until you have a better understanding Use a variety of materials: YouTube videos, books, and experts. Return to step two and simplify further.

**Note: When you simply you are cutting out the slack, do not remove things that are important for understanding whatever you trying to learn. You are simply trying to be more concise.**

##**Step Four:**

Use the aid of simple analogies, diagrams, metaphors and anything else that can help you commit what you have learned to memory. Come at it from different angles to gain a deeper understanding of the topics.
Einstein is often attributed to saying:

***“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough”***

The Feynman Technique will ensure that you understand any subject incredibly well. 

##**What Can You Learn Using The Method?**

To put it simply you can learn anything with the method from:

* Computer Programming 
* Calculus 
* Physics
* Economics 
* Chemistry 
* Mathematics

Anything at all! You might have to modify the method slightly for some disciplines but the main underlying principle is what makes the method so effective. 


##**WHY IT WORKS:**

The Feynman Technique works for many reasons. Often when we are trying to learn new concepts we erroneously assume that we have learned them and understood them when in actuality we haven’t fully grasped the concepts. 

Feynman once said:

***“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”***

This is the first and most critical mistake that many make when trying to learn new things. Writing what you know and trying to simplify it exposes your gaps in understanding. 

The second reason it works is through the beauty of neural connections. Think back to 2 weeks ago when you went grocery shopping. Can you remember what you bought or what happened at the shops? Most likely not, your brain does not put much stock into the mundane. Now let’s assume 2 weeks ago you were shopping and you saw three firefighters running towards to deli section. Now that’s a memory you won’t forget, you might remember it for the rest of your life because it was out of the ordinary. 

The strongest neural connections are always formed with things that are out of the ordinary. This is why you can remember what you were doing when you heard about 9/11 or can vividly recall your first kiss.
Now when you are learning and are up to step 4. You are forced to come up with analogies and metaphors to help you understand concepts. This simple process is out of the ordinary and allows your brain to have more stimulus to work with, more checkpoints to return to when you trying to recall a piece of information. 
So that’s the Feynman Method, for overrun and an actual real-time example, make sure to check out my animated video here:

995,7che04,"Meta Rule:  Be a narcissistic jerk -- or at least act like one -- even if it's not your nature.  This facilitates everything else.

1.  Take care of yourself first!!!  You cannot count on anyone -- especially any romantic interest -- to stick by you if you get sick or lose your job.  Therefore, do everything in your power to make sure you stay fit, healthy, and gainfully employed.

2.  Women rate 80% of guys as being below average aesthetically (OKC survey).  Therefore, do whatever it takes to get into and remain in the top 20%.  Exercise and diet are priorities.  If you have to ""cheat"" do so.  weight loss surgery, TRP, cosmetic surgery, do what you have to.

3.  Don't slack off even if you're in a LTR.  She'll expect you to ignore her physical decline but she sure as fuck won't ignore yours.  Going to the gym is actually more important for guys in LTRs -- they have more to lose.

4.  Don't play her game -- being a strong male is way more important than cheap romantic gestures.  She wants a strong Alpha not a fat sick Beta with roses.
 
5.  Do not invest in any relationship with a woman until she proves she's worthy.

6.  If she's externally motivated run!  If she's excessively concerned about what her friends, colleagues, and acquaintances think she's not relationship material.  This type of girl is expensive and never satisfied.
    
7.  It's a good thing for a woman to have goals.  However, talk is cheap, if a woman is all talk and hasn't actually executed she's not relationship material.  Getting what you want takes work and sacrifice.  If she has a history of not putting in the work and not enduring the requisite sacrifice to reach her stated goals she's not worth your time, effort, or investment.

8.  Stay away from damaged women.  If she's been abused and/or traumatized be empathetic but write her off as a serious prospect.  Cold for sure but very important for self-preservation.
 
9.  If her mother is an objectionable person run.  If her mother is a dishonest, grasping, materialistic objectionable person run faster.  We all know where this item is going.

10.  If she claims to be nothing like her mother look for proof that she is indeed different.  DON'T JUST TAKE HER WORD FOR IT!!!  The proof must encompass a very significant amount of time and must involve serious effort on her part.

11.  Stay away from women who claim they're ""not like those other bitches"".  She's most likely either lying or deluding herself.  If she has a history of being dishonest, greedy, and self centered she's just like those other bitches (if not worse).
 
12.  Stay away from women who are always making excuses.  Life requires effort to overcome obstacles.  If she has a history of being derailed by minor obstacles she's not relationship material.  This is especially true if she's otherwise smart and, therefore, could have, with a little effort, easily negotiated her way around or over life's little obstacles.  Examples; (a) gets taken to the cleaners at the used car dealership because she never had a father to teach her how to buy a car -- especially bad when she works just two blocks from a Barnes & Noble with many good books on how to buy a used car -- and let's not forget the internet; (b)  never finished college because her family wasn't supportive and didn't go back even though advancement in her chosen career absolutely requires a 4 year degree at the very least -- especially bad when the degree she needs can be obtained online through a number of reputable universities (good state schools).

13.  No agency or execution.  If she only takes advantage of opportunities that fall into her lap she's not relationship material.  Individuals need to act -- if you have a goal it's on you to take the action necessary to reach it.  If the only reason she got an AA is because her welfare social worker told her it was either that or get a minimum wage job run.  If she started a degree completion program through her employer but never followed up on her own when budget cuts terminated the program run.

14.  If she has a history of substance abuse run!  Even an eating disorder counts.  If she can't control what she puts into her body how can she be trusted with anything.

15.  If you want a Norman Rockwell life you have to choose a woman with deeply ingrained middle class values (i.e. internally motivated, strong work ethic, truly values honesty, willing to delay gratification ...).  If her ghetto or trailer park background is just below the surface she's not relationship material.   ",995,4.0,0.4203000068664551,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
996,2zp8n4,"They're all virgin neckbeards. Couldn't get laid to save their lives.

I consider it somewhat ironic on a meta level, that the people saying this don't themselves see the irony. 

Recently we were deemed the most bigoted subreddit on this site. And of course the usual insults began to fly. We are, as everybody knows, just a bunch of sexless, angry, nobodies. 

I'm hoping I've caught the attention of at least a few new people taking a peek to see what we're about. You're probably hoping to find evidence to support the popular opinion- that we should be chided or ignored. 

The reason we are here and the reason we don't care about the insults are one in the same: Because joining the red pill did not *start* the insults, instead the insults started the red pill.

The irony sorely lost on the masses is in the call for equality, anti-bigotry, and whatever other causes your average social justice warrior stands up for. The public has doubled down and taken up the very weapons they decry. Shame and scorn against those they disagree with. *Sexual shame* in retribution for *valuing sex*. Smooth.

They say that we're wrong in our assessments, and then revoke our manhoods by commenting on our inability to get sex.

But they've got the order of operations down wrong. 

I'm not going to deny that we have had trouble with sex. That is the common thread that brings us here. Using sexlessness to dismiss us is precisely the behavior that brought men here to begin with. We *were* sexless. Our views and perspectives, our so-called ""bigotry"" did not lead us to a sexless life so you can conveniently dismiss our views. Instead, our sexless lives lead us to adopt these views as a last ditch effort to reach sexual success. And most of us stayed here when we realized it was effective.

**But life isn't all about sex! You guys are obsessed!**

Right? 

I think it's pretty safe to say that most women don't really understand to what degree sex matters in the average man's life. He finds more than a physical release, he finds belonging and acceptance in sex. Sex for a man is knowing you are wanted. The fact is, for most of our lives, we've come to accept that we are not sexually desirable to most (or all) women. Our advances left us crushed and depressed, were treated as creepy or worse than murder. Our relationships left us broken or broke. Our marriages crumbled. If you listen to pop culture, and believe everybody finds their special somebody, then we must have been the outcasts.

The fact that commenting on our lack of sexual success is inherent in all public dismissal of us (virgin neckbeards) should help put this into perspective- even the feminists and social justice warriors of the world denouncing sex as that important have made our manhoods (and therefore rights to have or speak an opinion at all) entirely dependent on our access to sex. Why would being a virgin or a neckbeard matter, unless sex *truly does matter to our manhoods?* 

I don't really buy the rationale that it does matter to be a man. But I do recognize that sex will still be important to men nevertheless. And so here I support such a hypothesis, and behold, 102,000 men in two years have flocked. You can dismiss us, our views, and theories. But you cannot dismiss the common need and problem that brought us together.

I want to back up a little bit, and address the idea that we're social outcasts. 

Now, you'd think, every gender and every group has their outcasts. Looking back at highschool, there were always those fringe groups that didn't quite get along. Some banded together in their unpopularity and played dungeons and dragons or wore funny looking clothing. So what's the red pill? Just a group of pimply-faced nerds who never learned to talk to women?

That's the problem here- the reason for our corner of the internet. It affects more than just the pimply-faced nerds, more than the short guys, more than the fat, the skinny, or the ugly. 

The changes to inter-gender relations over the past 30 years have started to affect *all of us*.

You can see it in the declining marriage rates, in the studies that show dissatisfaction among both genders in relationships, the sky-high divorce rates, and the endless stories of custody battles and alimony cases. The school shootings and the male suicide rate, the gamer scandals, and presidential campaigns. The declining rate of male college graduates and the women who don't care. The single mothers, and the children who hate men.

We're not the sexless virgins. We're not the neckbeards.

We're fathers, firefighters, pilots, drivers, teachers, engineers, students, bankers, and entrepreneurs who are tall, skinny, fit, fat, good-looking, ugly, old, young, happy, angry, sad, depressed,  and everything in between.

And we've all been affected by the changing environment. 

And none of us found compassion, belonging, or empathy in the very system that gave us this shared experience.

Maybe we are bigots, maybe we hate women. Maybe we aren't, and maybe we don't.  It's entirely superfluous to the point of why we're here. Attacking these points does not dismiss our existence, nor does it address it.

It's up to you how you're going to deal with this information. ",996,4.0,0.28760001063346863,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
997,99zxpf,"In 2016, Nikki Yovino had consensual sex with two football players in a bathroom at a party.  The next day, she claimed she was raped, allegedly to impress a prospective boyfriend.  The two students were suspended, lost their scholarships, and faced ostracism.  It later came to light that she fabricated the claims, and has now been tried and convicted of making a false report.  She was sentenced to 3 years, and will probably serve 6 months-1 year in jail then probation.

______

From the news story:

Nikki Yovino just doesn’t seem to get it.

The 19-year-old Long Island woman — who claimed she was raped by two Sacred Heart University football players, then admitted months later to police that she lied to impress a prospective boyfriend, then claimed on the witness stand she was forced to have sex without her consent. Until finally she pleaded guilty to criminal charges, admitting her deceit to a judge — stood handcuffed Thursday morning, rolling her eyes as one of the now former players poured out his heart in court.
“I just hope you spend the time reflecting on what you did,” Superior Court Judge William Holden told Yovino, sentencing her to three years, suspended after she serves one year in prison and followed by probation.

Yovino agreed to plead guilty to two counts of second-degree falsely reporting an incident and one count of interfering with police, all misdemeanors, as the case was about to go to trial. She has already served three months in prison and likely faces another three months before she is eligible for release.

“This was not an easy charging decision for the state,” Senior Assistant State’s Attorney Tatiana Messina told the judge. “But with the evidence we had against Miss Yovino, we do believe this disposition is both fair and appropriate. Many true victims of sexual assault are often disbelieved, but that is because of cases like this and the impact they have on public perceptions. Miss Yovino’s actions are a disservice to those true victims, in addition to the two young men whose lives were greatly affected, and that was not something that could have been ignored.”

Yovino’s mother, the only member of her family there to support her, was kicked out of the courtroom after her cellphone went off.

### Takeaway lessons

* Hookups at a party are risky behavior, for questionable reward
* An accusation of rape is easy to make and difficult to defend
* The tide is turning; women are being held accountable for false claims more and more
* The wheels of justice turn *slowly.*  The young mens' lives have been turned upside down for the last two years
* The justice system can work, but it takes proaction and determination by the accused.   If you don't do your due diligence, fail to follow up with prosecutors and lawyers, drop your efforts because of all the hassle, or accept a bullshit plea deal just to try to end it, then its not going to go as well for you or for other men in similar circumstances",997,1.0,0.46880000829696655,"life, work, rape, stop, mgtow, word, female, turn, high, keep"
998,8uvmk7,"Are you sitting there right now, with your phone in your hand, your palms sweating, heart pumping, mind racing, about to make a post on AskTRP asking what you should text/say to a girl over social media or how to respond to something she sent you or said to you?

If you are ever having to ask yourself, or needing to ask others, ""What the hell should I text this girl/respond with"", or ""How long should I wait to respond to this text"" or anything that requires any thinking and planning in regards to texting her, chances are, you're not her top option. 

When you are her top option, **you'll know**. There will be no doubt or guessing. The level of investment and attention she will be giving you will be off the charts to the point where its almost creepy or clingy. She will respond immediately to your texts, initiate conversation all the time, and always be available. You won't worry if she will respond or not. Escalation attempts/logistic arrangements are cooperative and accepted. Since you are at the top of her mind, its almost impossible to lose. You are all she is thinking about. When her phone vibrates or makes noise, she picks it up hoping its you. 

#You don't have time to sit there and wonder what to text her, what to say, how long to respond, how to escalate, or any of that shit. Because either she will do all the work for you and take all the guesswork out of it, or she will positively respond to pretty much anything you send her way within reason. It's almost impossible to do wrong in her eyes. It's like some kind of super cheat code has been activated.  

When you aren't her top option, **you'll know**. You will feel like you are doing all the legwork. She will seem cold, standoffish or rationing her attention. She will take forever to respond to texts, if she responds at all. Her texts will be brief and to the point. You'll get wishy washy communication and answers. You send texts and such worrying she won't respond. Getting her to communicate with you will feel like you are trying to give her root canal. She won't respond to escalation attempts/logistics and ghost you or give you vague wishy washy answers, or worse, try to change the subject and act like she didn't even see it. It's because you aren't at the top of her mind, and therefore, not a priority for her. When her phone vibrates or makes a noise, she picks it up hoping its her top option, and its not, instead, its you, and she is disappointed. This leads to negative reinforcement in her mind(since she was disappointed it was you), and actually depreciates you in her eyes and makes it difficult for you to climb up the ladder and become her top option. 

#It's a night and day difference when you are and aren't a girl's top option. 

You are sitting there thinking what to say, how to respond, how long to wait, and all of that because the frame is already set. You're not her top option. You're trying to figure out how to be her top option, failing to realize you are only digging your hole deeper the harder you try. It's not something you can negotiate, its not something you can do simply by texting her more and more. 

When you aren't her top option, the best thing you can do is withdraw. I know it sucks, and it might feel like you are ending any momentum you may have had, but trust me. The more you communicate with her when you aren't her top option, the more pissed off she will get at you in her subconcious. She has a man in mind, and you aren't him. 

When you are her top option, its blatantly obvious, you won't have to ask. It's easy mode of easy mode. There are really only 3 things you can do to hurt yourself when you are her top option:

* Self depreciation. I.E. typical beta behavior. 

* Going full, 100% player. It's fine to go 90% player with her. But too much and she will not trust you.

*  Loss of Frame. 

Every single one of those 3 would be self inflicted if you are her top option. Beta behavior? Self inflicted. Going too much player? Self inflicted. Loss of frame? Since you're her top option, things are in your frame, so any loss of frame would be self inflicted. 

That's it. You can do no wrong in her eyes otherwise, so it doesn't really fucking matter what you say, when you reach out, how long you wait between texts, what you do. Chances are she will do the initiating and the talking and the communicating and even the logistics arranging so all you have to do is not be a beta autist try hard and its you're golden ticket. Don't fuck it up. Easy easy easy mode when you are her top option is to **say nothing at all** and let your actions do the talking. You literally can't screw up at that point. 

#BUT MALLARDCOVE! I'm not her top option right now, how do I become her top option!!!????

Like I said earlier. **WITHDRAW**. I repeat - when her phone vibrates, when it makes a ringtone, she picks it up, gets excited and gets a dopamine rush, hoping its her top option. Then she sees that its you(not her top option) and disappointment washes over her brain. She then begins to associate you with disappointment each time this happens(negative reinforcement), killing your value in her eyes. 

Withdraw, and game other women, try to find one who will actually appreciate you because you're her top option. Trust me. When you are her top option there is no stress or worry, its easy and care free. That sounds much more pleasant than stressing over some bitch who doesn't give a fuck about you. 

#BUT MALLARDCOVE, I don't want to withdraw. I want her.

Drop the scarcity mentality, kill your oneitis. find options, learn abundance. But I know most of you fucks won't listen to me, so I'll say this. Withdraw for 10-20 days, forget about her but keep her on the backburner, game other women, and try to send out ONE feeler text to see how she reacts. Chances are she's not into you, and you still aren't her top option, so you'll either get no response or a wishy washy one. If you do, put her back on the backburner, wait 10-20 days, forget about her, game other women, and do it again, but keep in mind there is no point in continuing this cycle. Because if you all of a sudden do become her top option, she will reach out to you. You won't have to go find her. 

The only reason I put this here is because I have had limited success(keyword: limited) with the backburner approach before, but that's because I literally forget about these women, don't care, and game other women. So when I reach out to the backburner women, I give no fucks either way and eventually give up and 100% forget about her after 1 or 2 attempts. The backburner method doesn't have a high success rate, but the success rate isn't 0, which can add up to several extra dates/lays over the long run. The problem is that you fucks have scarcity mentality/oneitis, so you will not understand the core principles behind the backburner method and how to actually do it the right way, and you're destined to fuck it up. The backburner method doesn't fucking work if she's your only option and the only girl you are pursuing. Because if you are a chef only preparing one dish, putting that dish on the backburner is fucking stupid and makes no sense. 

#BUT MALLARDCOVE, just because I am not her top option, doesn't mean she isn't into me, right?

When you aren't her top option, she absolutely isn't into you. Women get oneitis just like men. Yes, they have men on the backburner themselves and backups, but they are not into those guys until they are needed(invisible). 

The thing is, women are programmed to focus on one guy, because that's how women evolved. That's why oneitis in men is inherently a beta/feminine behavior, because men evolved to spread their seed across several females. 

Women don't give a fuck about you when you aren't her top option, and it will be perfectly clear. Even if she tries to string you along and make you an orbiter/LJBF/friendzone, she doesn't give a fuck about you outside of what's in it for her and what she can extract out of you. She might be attracted to you, but she isn't INTO you unless you are her top option.  

#BUT MALLARDCOVE! I just got her number, you see. You don't expect me to be her top option right away, right?

Obviously it may be a bit of a stretch to be a girl's top option right off the bat(if a girl is anywhere remotely attractive, she'll have at least a dozen of viable male options in her stable at any given moment). But there is only one way to find out. Hit her up. See how she responds. Like I said, you'll know. I've had girls be into me and be their top option right off the bat. It does happen. You might need to build a tad of rapport over 3-5 message exchanges, but it can happen if you are attractive enough with a strong enough frame. If she's not into you, everything I have written applies. Withdraw, game other women, put her on the backburner, and if you become a top option for her, she'll reach out.

999,5zl7gq,"How often do you hear women tell you the following?  

“I haven’t felt butterflies like that in years.” 

“We shouldn’t be left in a room alone together.”

“Wow, how do you do that to me?”

Master the triggers for sexual attraction outlined in this article, and beautiful women you’ve just met will make the above statements regularly. 

There are five elements to creating an irresistible sexual attraction: 1. Intent 2. Tension 3. Eye Contact 4. Mystery 5. Sexual conversation. Fortunately, there are simple, practical tricks you can learn that will allow you to master each of these elements with ease.

	                                   Intent

Intent can be such a murky concept. Although it might seem like you’ll have to fine-tune your chakras or meditate in a cave to master intent, it’s actually a concept grounded in human psychology. Put simply, intent is your expectation of what is going to happen in an interaction with a woman. 

Intent is mostly expressed in feelings. Humans evolved mirror neurons that allow us to feel what people we interact with are feeling. This allowed people to avoid dangerous situations, if someone had a bad intent, they could feel that something was off, and so they would exercise caution in that interaction. Similarly, if you are nervous, a woman will be able to feel that, and she will assume that you must be nervous for a reason, your intent will make her lose interest in you. Conversely, if you feel confidently attracted to her, she’s much more likely to feel the same for you.	
 	
So, if you expect a girl to like you, she’s more likely to become attracted to you. How do you learn to project a strong intent? No, you don’t need to align your chakras or meditate in a cave. You can build your intent through a technique that psychologists use to treat anxiety, conscious reinterpretation. 

Harvard scientists ran a study in which they caused participants to feel socially anxious by making them give a speech in front of an audience. The first group wasn’t given any special instructions, and unsurprisingly their levels of social anxiety were high and their performances suffered as a result. The second group was given a very simple exercise to practice. Whenever they felt nervous, they were to tell themselves, “I feel excited.” They were instructed to reinterpret anxiety as excitement. The audience scored the second group as performing significantly better, and participants in the second group also self-reported feeling more calm and confident. 

How do you use this to change your intent? If you are nervous talking to a girl, you can do exactly what participants in the study were instructed to do, tell yourself, “I am excited.” Over time, as you practice this, your anxiety will turn into excitement, and she will feel this excitement off of you, and therefore feel more positively towards you. 
	
But you can take this even further, when a girl makes you feel anxious, you could interpret that as nerves, but you could also interpret that as sexual attraction. In fact, the feelings people feel when they are nervous and when they are attracted to someone are almost identical: butterflies in the stomach, fast heartbeat, and even sweaty palms. If you feel that these symptoms are a bad thing, they will make you feel uncomfortable, if you feel that they are your body’s way of telling you that you should talk to someone, they will be positive. When you see a girl you like, and you feel the symptoms of attraction, tell yourself, “Damn, she’s attractive, I need to talk to her.” 
	
One of the largest psychology studies of all time found that the most powerful trigger for attraction is the feeling of being genuinely liked by someone else. When you learn to accurately reinterpret anxiety towards a girl as attraction for her, you will allow yourself to feel more attracted to her, and as a result, she will feel more attracted to you. This is the power of a strong intent.
	 
                               Sexual Tension

Negs, pushes, emotional spikes, are all techniques used to build sexual tension. Unfortunately, they are also the most misused techniques in the pickup community. I’ve floundered with these techniques many times myself, I would walk up to a girl I thought was particularly attractive, and I would start berating her with negs. I was overtly teasing her to raise my ‘perceived value’, and to make her feel a lack of validation. Suffice it to say, this didn’t build attraction, it just led to uncomfortable, and short, interactions.

Why? For any teasing technique to work, there’s an important nuance that must be understood. Before you tease, you and a woman must be in rapport for it to have a positive effect. If you and her aren’t on the same wavelength, aren’t vibing, than these techniques are meaningless. 
	
However, if a girl is connecting with you, and then you strip her of validation, it will build a powerful sexual tension. To get her validation back, she will start to chase you. There are many lines you can use to make a girl chase you, for example, if she says she’s from California, you can say, “I hate California.” If you were already in rapport with her, this will feel invalidating, it will make her wonder if you really like her. This creates a psychological vacuum effect, to ease her discomfort, she will start to chase you and earn your validation back. 

There are numerous effective techniques, the key is to only use these techniques after you’ve already built rapport with a girl. The power of this simple strategy will shock you. 

                                 Eye Contact

Eye contact can trigger attraction on its own. Famed evolutionary psychologist David Buss writes in his book, Why Women Have Sex, “In one study, forty-eight women and men came to a lab and were asked to stare into each other’s eyes while talking. The effect of mutual gaze proved powerful. Many reported that deep eye contact with an opposite-sex stranger created feelings of intense love. Another study had strangers first reveal intimate details of their lives to each other for half an hour, and then asked them to stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes— without breaking eye contact or making any conversation. Participants again reported deep attraction to their study partners. Two of these total strangers even ended up getting married!” 

Eye contact is powerful, but how do you improve it? Whenever you are in a location with women, improve your eye contact with this simple game. Whenever you see a woman, look at her eyes, if she doesn’t look at you, avert your gaze after 3 seconds, if she does look at you, hold eye contact until she looks away from you. 

Over time, this simple technique will lead you to make powerful eye contact effortlessly in all of your interactions with women. Your ability to create attraction will be significantly magnified. 

                                Mystery

Like intent, mystery can be a vague, hard-to-understand concept. In high school I learned that it was attractive to be mysterious, and I heard that to be mysterious meant not to talk much. So, to become mysterious, I just didn’t talk to girls. Maybe this did cause me to create an aura of mystery, but I was missing the point.
 
To be mysterious, you simply have to make a woman curious about you, you have to leave her with unanswered questions. Mystery is attractive because it shows that you have depth, and women get bored of the constant barrage of uninteresting, simple, guys that try to get in their pants. Show that you are different, offer her some mystery, and you will trigger attraction. 

How can you do this without learning complicated routines? Say one line that she won’t be able to get out of her head. Tell her something she doesn’t usually hear, something provocative, something that will make her wonder about you. 

My personal favorite line to accomplish this? 
	
“I bet you don’t meet a guy like me every day.”

This line has an insidious effect. It proves itself true, very few men would say something so cocky, and simply saying this line proves that you are different from other guys, because other guys don’t talk like that. 

This line creates mystery, because she will wonder exactly what it is that makes you different? She will want to know why you would say something like that, she will want to know why you have so much self-confidence. She’s going to want to solve this mystery, and the only way to do so, is to spend more time with you. 

                           Sexual Conversation

What happens when you think about sex? Assuming you don’t have some kind of dysfunction, you get aroused. If you talk about sex, you will make a woman more attracted to you because of a strange phenomenon called the misattribution of arousal. 
	In the famous bridge study, participants crossed a nerve-wracking swaying bridge with a 230 foot drop to the river below. On the other side, they were approached by an attractive female lab assistant and given a short survey. Afterwards, she gave them her phone number so they could call if they had any further questions. Half of the participants called the lab assistant after crossing the rickety bridge, and several even asked her on a date.

This is in contrast to the participants who crossed a safer, more stable bridge, none of whom asked the assistant on a date.

This is because, like I mentioned earlier, the symptoms of anxiety and attraction are very similar. Participants who crossed a dangerous, rickety bridge were brought into a state of heightened emotional arousal. They were still in this state when talking to the attractive lab assistant, and afterwards they decided to ask her on a date because they thought their anxiety from crossing the bridge was attraction to the lab assistant. 

Similarly, if you bring sexuality into a conversation, it won’t make a woman attracted to you directly, but thinking about sex will turn her on, and she will naturally associate her feelings of sexual arousal with the person she is interacting with, you.

How can you bring sex into a conversation without it being uncomfortable or awkward? Play the question game. The rules are simple, you each ask questions of each other, the more personal the better. Questions can’t be repeated, and if either of you are uncomfortable with a question, you can ask to have it replaced with another question. 

Tell her you want to play the game, explain the rules, and to start you can ask moderately sexual questions like, “What was your first kiss?” As the game progresses, ask progressively more sexual questions. Because it’s a game, nothing is off limits, and if you go too far, she can just pass to the next question. 

The question game will allow you to comfortably bring sex into your conversation, and as she thinks about sex, she will naturally associate those thoughts with the person she is talking to, namely, you. 

Conclusion

Integrate these five triggers for sexual attraction into your interactions with women and most women you meet will desire you. Women want to meet men who turn them on, but so few guys get it, so few men understand what really make a girl feel sexual attraction. These guys try to prove themselves with impressive jobs, nice cars, and big muscles. But women don’t want any of these things as much as they want a man who makes them feel good, use the techniques outlined in this article, and you can be confident in the fact that you will give women what they really want.

The Australian Government recently released a study done by world leading Professor Michael J. Hiscox (Professor of International Affairs in the Department of Government, Harvard University) about gender biases in Australian Government Employment.   


The purpose of the trial was to increase the amount of women in senior positions of the government by de-identifying applications for senior positions in the Australian Public Service. We all knew what was going to happen. Turns out, when the CV or Resume is de-indentified, more men are employed than women, and women are FAVOURED in employment over men when their gender appears on the CV. The Australian Government (which is full of cucks) has decided to stop the trial because it was not helping women have more representation in the senior positions of the Government work force. 


Excerpt from study:

""We found that the public servants engaged in positive (not negative) discrimination towards female and minority candidates:

* Participants were 2.9% more likely to shortlist female candidates and 3.2% less likely to shortlist male applicants when they were identifiable, compared with when they were de-identified.

* Minority males were 5.8% more likely to be shortlisted and minority females were 8.6% more likely to be shortlisted when identifiable compared to when applications were de-identified.

* The positive discrimination was strongest for Indigenous female candidates who were 22.2% more likely to be shortlisted when identifiable compared to when the applications were de-identified.""

1001,6xnyqh,"Started browsing this sub a while back. I thought a lot of the theory was interesting, made mental notes, and was on the lookout for confirmation in daily life. I found it some three months ago.

I am not an ""alpha"". I'll be the first to admit that. I'm active, fit, successful, but when it comes to straight out pissing contests, I generally lose. ""Winning through sheer confidence and aggression"" has never been my MO and likely never will be. Indirect confrontation is where I tend to thrive.

I got promoted about a year ago to more or less running the inventory and data analysis for my employer's global operations. Essentially a stand-in for our VP of operations specifically when it comes to inventory management and analytics anywhere outside of our home office. That means Hong Kong, Germany, Oceania, and other smaller outfits' inventory programs answer to me. The other 40% of my job is doing what I've always done: Inventory analytics for my product category in our domestic market.

Everything was going really well. I brought Germany, Hong Kong, and the rest of our global inventory into order (it was a shit show, everything is fine now). But it was tough to make people see the value I created in the home office because they didn't ""see"" me doing it. Numbers can only say so much to people who don't work with numbers for a living. Then about four months ago I find out that our VP hired a new analyst to focus ""on e-tail"". Totally blindsided, didn't even know they were interviewing. What makes it more problematic is that a lot of the forecasting I do is for e-tail. So whoever comes in is at least partially going to be absorbing some responsibilities from me. Still, not the end of the world because I have a ton of shit to do and am working on transitioning to a more global role.

But then I actually meet the guy. Total fucking Chad. Tall, incredibly sexy, built, cool, collected. You name it. I am immediately threatened, but force myself to reserve judgment because I have a tendency to snap judge people. My coworker, another analyst, tells me she despised him the second she met him. I even cautioned her to wait to judge him because I've been the new guy before and I know it can suck.

He has not been there three weeks, doesn't even know how to navigate our ERP and forecasting system properly before he starts talking about how he's going to ""elevate"" the forecasting. Big fan of that word, ""elevate"". He starts going through my forecasts and changing them. For those of you who are not familiar with being an analyst, changing an analyst's forecasts is akin to ""fixing"" a table that another carpenter made. It's essentially you telling them you don't think they're good at their job. And if you do it, you had better be fucking right.

My coworker and I are perhaps the only two people at our company that understand statistics on a fundamental level. She and I looked at the forecast adjustments he had made on my items and, just by glancing at them, *immediately* knew this kid was a fucking idiot.

The problem was, he presented himself so well and was such an alpha etc. that everyone else loved him. The men were buddy buddy with him almost immediately (he was so good at talking about sportsball) and every woman in our department save my friend were throwing themselves at him. I thought these were rational people. NOPE. The second a hot guy shows up, they go weak in the knees and forget me immediately. My friend told me that he had tried to talk shit about me to her, not knowing that we were super tight (We get drinks like every weekend and recently became business partners in our side venture. I was at her grandson's christening.). So it was obvious that this son of a bitch was gunning for me. Which was unfortunate because he *was* pretty hot and fun to look at.

He talked about his kids and wife to anyone who would listen, but I didn't care. I knew I had to get rid of him even if it meant putting his kids in the bread lines. So I started using logic and my knowledge of statistics to explain in our meetings why his ideas were wrong. Big fucking mistake. He just interrupted me and made stupid jokes at my expense and everyone laughed at me (particularly the women) because they don't *understand* the statistics or the numbers. They're morons. They don't get when the numbers are explained to them. They need to *see* it. It didn't matter that I was 100% correct, right? He would just try to make me look like an ass and a nerd.

The only way to get rid of him was to let him fail spectacularly and publicly in a way that he couldn't blame on anybody else. So I stopped reviewing his forecasts, knowing that it would cause us to be out of stock for some of our largest customers. I put in vacation time for three weeks about three months in advance, knowing almost exactly to the day when we would be out of stock, because unlike him I'm actually good at what I do.

I went to France and had two and a half glorious weeks with a guy there whom I am very attracted to. We saw the sights around Marseilles. All the while knowing that the clock was ticking. And then, on a Thursday, it exploded.

We were out of stock on thirteen of our largest moving items. Customers were calling to complain. Shit was hitting the fan. Who changed the forecasts to be so low? Oh, it was Chad. No matter, we'll have the other analyst fix them. Oh, she's out sick with a sudden and inexplicable illness? (She was actually at Six Flags, I believe; I had given her a heads up the day before) I guess we'll have to call that nerd we laughed at back early on his vacation to fix Chad's mess. His ticket isn't scheduled for another four days? Fuck, I guess the company has to fly him back here at our own expense because he needs to be here *today*! There are only first class seats available on such short notice? That's pricey. *And* we need to pay him for his vacation time.

I came in like a bat out of Hell, made a huge show of having to stay late to ""fix this mess"". I didn't point any fingers. His name was all over the forecast adjustments, so I didn't have to. He meekly offered to help me at one point. I asked him ""Don't you think you've helped enough already?""

Before I went home at about 9PM that night, I sent the owner of the company an email detailing, in dollars and cents, how much this fuck-up had cost him. At the end of the next week, he was gone, *all* the while talking about his wife and kids. Wife and kids, wife and kids. You know who cared *now*? Fucking nobody, that's who. They smiled and wished him luck and got away from his desk as quickly as they could, the women included. Typical. Fits right in with women avoiding injured males. He was damaged goods now.

Not only was I still here, but I had been given a bonus for my efforts *plus* being compensated for my vacation time. Turns out you totally can put a price on another person, and in this case the price was a hair under two grand. So in a sense, I owe Chad a thank you because getting him fired helped me fund my retirement *slightly* sooner while keeping me in vodka and blow.

Chad taught me valuable lessons: Don't tolerate for a second someone moving in your turf. Don't trust people to be rational. And I taught Chad a very valuable lesson too: At the end of the day, money talks, you stupid cunt. Welcome to the jungle, I hope your wife and kids have to go on SNAP, fuck you and the used Camaro you rode in on.

I now absolutely buy TRP, hook, line, and sinker. I never thought all the people in this department were my friends, per se, but I thought they at least trusted my *judgment*. But no. The only person who saw value in what I did was the only other person who also did it for a living and was basically my best friend, so she shouldn't count. The second an ""alpha"" showed up, all bets were off and I was chopped liver. Great lessons all around.",1001,4.0,0.2809999883174896,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
1002,8sk3m8,"A few weeks ago I was standing on an underground escalator and did that thing where I turn around to watch all the bored people behind me as I slowly rise backwards into the air and feel like I’m in some kind of dystopian movie cutscene.

As I turn I’m greeted by the face an older woman. She’s standing right behind me on the step below, and notices me turn around; looks a bit puzzled about it. Of course it’s kind of a weird thing to do to turn around on an escalator, I don’t blame her, and I can’t just ignore her presence as if she’s not there, we’re standing uncomfortably face to face. Hey don’t blame me she broke the escalator etiquette of leaving one step in-between each person. We have those rules for a reason man.

Okay so she’s not that old, like middle age, but I’m young so she’s out my range for women I can comfortably hit on. I can tell that back in her time she must have been a real looker, wall hasn’t smashed her too hard yet, nice hair and makeup, but I can see the tiredness of a long office day in her eyes. It’s kind of awkward though and I’ll look like more of a sperg if I don’t say something.

> So I say “Hi”.
> 
> She’s very suspicious of me. Of course, I got that whole fuckboy thing going on.
> 
> “Hello” she says.
> 
> “You’re very pretty” I say. 
> 
> Her eyes light up, then her mouth follows, into a big, toothy smile. 
> 
> “Um, thank you” she stammers out, blushing. She seems very surprised yet pleased by this. Her face looks younger and softer.
> 
> “That’s all I wanted to say-bye”. 

> I walk up the remainder of the escalator. 

> She laughs hard and then says “bye” too. 

As I hop off I sneak a glance behind me and she’s still beaming like a happy child, smiling to herself. 

When I got home I had this tremendous sense of satisfaction with myself, a wellbeing that followed me into a pleasant dream and a happy morning. It felt great.

So I did it again.
_________________
It was an underground train, and a girl hopped on in what seemed to be a cosplay. Had a blue wig on and the pleated schoolgirl skirt and the zettai ryouki; had she been older I would have been all over that shit but actually probably not because I still have mad anxiety with hitting on girls on public transport… everyone’s watching and can hear everything!

But I remembered what happened the day before… what if I just… complimented her…. and didn’t hit on her explicitly?

The idea that I’m not actually after anything and there’s no possibility of rejection at the end because I’m not gonna request anything off her was absolutely freeing… so I spoke to her as the train stopped into the next station. 

> “Hey, I like your cosplay”
> 
> She blushes. “Um, thanks”
> 
> “Who’s it supposed to be?”

She told me an anime that I didn’t know, and that she was going to a photoshoot, stuttering the whole time. 

It’s cute when you can make girls malfunction like that.

I was going to say something else but then the train started moving again and the Jubilee line wails like the grinding gears and billowing winds of hell itself. So we waited, awkwardly, in silence, while people around snuck glances at us. 
We reach the next stop. 

> “Well, have fun at your photoshoot” I say, as I hop off. This stop was actually mine. 
> 
> “Thanks” she says back, looking kind of upset I was leaving.

Once again, easy peasy. I was kinda bummed I didn’t get her number but she was also a bit too young and that wasn’t the intention anyway. I just wanted to make her happy. I bet her photoshoot went much nicer and her smiles were much brighter in the pictures.

And it didn’t cost me anything. In fact, I probably got just as much out of it as she did.

Looking back, if I set out with the intention of actually closing on her, I know for a fact I would have hamstered myself into pussying out. “Not in front of all these people” I would have said. “She’ll think I’m creepy”, I would have said.

But this… this was practice…this was benign, no ulterior motives. And in fact I just proved to myself that it actually would have gone well and she wouldn’t have gone super bitch-mode and girls aren’t that mean and strangers aren’t that scary.

_________________
I remember whenever my ex-LTR would get hit on by Incels and pickup artists she would come home beaming and tell me about it immediately. We’d laugh about their cringey lines together but I could tell she loved it because it was the best compliment she received all day.

Women love compliments. They feeeeeeed off of them. They live for them. They want them all the time. 

But compliments from friends and family come in thick, and they can be disingenuous, or repetitive. Does she really look pretty in that dress or is her boyfriend just trying to get head later?

But a compliment from a stranger? That’s a real compliment. There can be no other reason for it except that it’s genuine. Getting hit on or stared at by random dudes is a huge life-giver to a lot of women… because it tells them that they are objectively attractive, attractive enough to meet the criteria of strangers on the outside world, attractive enough that a dude literally broke social convention just to tell her “that dress really suits you”.

It makes her day. Quite literally. It will bring a skip to her step and she’ll go to bed thinking about it, a small highlight of an otherwise monotonous life.

So why not do it? Why not bring some happiness into the life of a stranger, and yourself in the process? It feels good to make others feel good. 

And it’s good practice, especially for those of you who are still having trouble with cold approaching. Go cold approach a girl and tell her you like her shoes, or she’s just so pretty you had to say something, or “hey, sorry I can’t stop staring at you, you’re beautiful”… and then just leave. 

Over time, after the first few nervous failures, you’ll get used to just approaching random girls, and you’ll find out that a lot of them, more than you would expect, are very kind and take it very well. 

Eventually you can learn to extend these into actual conversations, and then a number, and then a date, and then a marathon fuck session. 

But it all starts with having the balls to compliment a stranger.
________________
So let’s go over the benefits:

**1) Kills Approach Anxiety**

Immunises you to talking to strangers. You get used it and realise it’s not that bad.

**2) You realise most women are kind**

Teaches you the majority of women respond positively to strangers speaking to them and aren’t rude about it. 

**3) You realise rejection isn’t that bad**

Some will be bitchy, but who cares, you weren’t trying to pick her up… and then you’ll be fine and you didn’t die after… hmm, maybe this rejection thing is kind of okay. Maybe some people are just rude or having a bad day and it reflects nothing on me… 

Plus then you get to reverse her once you leave and think like “ha, you were bitchy but I was actually just being nice how does that feel huh?” Good shit.
 
**4) Abundance mentality**

Do it once a day, or whenever you feel like it, and you’ll quickly realise there’s a huge amount of very pretty girls everywhere and maybe your one-itis isn’t the only beautiful woman to ever exist. 

**5) You did a good thing**

And most importantly, it spreads happiness and good intentions without asking for anything in return; yet you will reap the rewards in Karma, almost instantly.

So try it, for me, and yourself. Make her day.

1003,70t64r,"Hey guys...here to help

I have been in the game or ""red-pilled"" for 8 years now.

I was a virgin going into college and read ""the game"" and a ebook about college game on the internet. Forget the name. 

Anyways I got laid here and there but struggled with women throughout college and was generally awkward and socially unaware. 

I think the turning point for me was about a year after college, since then I've slept with over 100 women some were gorgeous and some were complete dogs and I don't say that lightly. Had a few relationships along the way as well. 

Anyways, enough about me - here are some simple tips I think would help out a lot of you in there. 

1. Women are not inherently evil. It's not their fault.

They are fundamentally different than us. Their brain has a different chemistry, and it's not their fault. They are the more vulnerable sex, and their brains have evolved to maximize their ability to survive and reproduce. 

They will always look for a man who provides them with status, safety, and security, while secretly or overtly desiring the alpha male - I don't think I need to explain what an alpha male is on here. 

There will always be someone better looking, braver, manlier, more successful, wealthier, or better looking than you. Accept that if your wife or girlfriend encounters this man she will be extremely attracted and her instincts will scream at her to sleep with him. 

Once you accept this fact, and come to peace with it - you will have a much healthier appreciation for women and most importantly an inner peace. 

2. Every woman is different, Every woman is the same.

Don't treat a girl like a robot. They are human beings. They are extremely different in their interests, goals, passions, desires, idiosyncrasies, etc. 

However, much like we are all attracted to a beautiful face with perky tits, a tight ass, and a nice body (for the most part), just about every girl craves an alpha male, whether they admit it or not. 

From the moment you first lock eyes she is testing you. 

If you think you have her in the bag and let your guard down, she will notice, and will treat you accordingly. 

""The game"" is never over, it's always on. Women constantly test us to figure out who we really are, in order to differentiate the real you from the person you outwardly present yourself to be. 

Even after you have proven yourself to her, she will constantly ""test"" you to make sure you are still that guy, and haven't lost your edge. (This applies more to long-term relationships than one night stands)

3. Judge her by her actions, not her words

Do not hold a woman to the same level of honor as a man and do not expect her to keep her word. A woman lives and dies by her emotions. She may say ""I love you"" on Tuesday, and feel completely different on Saturday night, depending on your behavior and her emotional state. 

Take what she says with caution, many times she is simply trying to illicit a response or manipulating you into doing something that is favorable to her and detrimental to you. 

Women are masters of emotion. If you succumb or react to her getting angry, upset, or vindictive, she will subconsciously sense weakness and question your ability to provide for and protect her. Remember, this is not her fault, she is usually not consciously aware or trying to do this to you, it's merely instinct. 

4. Do not swim against the tide. 

Make things as easy as possible for yourself. It is true that there are exceptions to the rule, however why make success with women an uphill battle, sport, or egotistical endeavor?

If you are 5'4 you will be most successful with shorter women. 

If you are just starting out and don't have much experience, go for the cute girl taking shots with her friends at the edge of the bar instead of the supermodel sitting with her posse in bottle service. 

6's and 7's can often be a lot more fun to hang out with and sleep with than perfect 10's. In fact, they usually are. The hottest girls are often not worth the headache. 

Have good grooming, work out, dress nice, and take pride in your appearance. There is such a thing as trying too hard, and I think we all know what that looks like, don't be that guy. On the flipside, there are plenty of out of shape assholes who smell like whiskey and dress like shit - and still get laid, but the chances are if you are reading this you are probably not that guy. 

Try to drive a nice car, have a nice place and have a decent job - that doesn't mean you should flaunt it or use it as a bargaining chip. Honestly you should do that for yourself, but of course it improves your attractiveness.

5. Play the numbers game

The more girls you talk to and date the less you will be concerned about each individual reaction and the girl will absolutely pick up on it. 

Remember, our natural instinct is to sleep with as many girls as possible in order to create as many offspring as possible. If you are attempting to hide, apologize for, or suppress your natural feelings as a man she will sense that you are not a sexually fit man and that you will sacrifice your dignity and resources in order to date and have a chance to reproduce with her. Again subconscious and not her fault. 

When you are single, always keep a dialog with multiple women, and when in a relationship make sure to constantly talk to and surround yourself with attractive women. Never let a girl feel that she is your only option and that you are desperate to keep her...once she feels that she controls the relationship she will start treating you differently, attraction will fade, and she will leave you at the first opportunity.

6. Girls just want to have fun

Of course there are exceptions, but the average girl just wants to feel safe, be taken care of, and have fun. 

If you take dating too seriously or give the impression of actively focusing on your dating life, it will signal a lack of options and a sense of desperation. Take what comes to you, you don't need to sleep with every girl on the first date, you are allowed to be yourself, and not every girl is going to like you, whether you like it or not and no matter how good your game is. 

Just some practical advice I've gained over the years through successes, painful experiences, and plenty of trial and error. 

One last thing, no one's perfect. If you slip up don't freak out - girls realize that we all make mistakes and no one is perfect. They care more about who you are inside over the long run. They will look over a occasional breakdown or episode here or there if you are a quality guy. 

P.S. One more thing. You don't have to have a pornstar dick to please a woman. But learn how to do it right and drive her crazy. She will keep coming back for more. Unfortunately there is no substitution for practice. A steady girlfriend is not the worst thing ever.",1003,4.0,0.3630000054836273,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
1004,46edgg,"*tl;dr:* ""Psychological abuse"", another broadly defined term that you can go to prison over.

I'm not making too long a post about this, it's just a rant to get the word out asap. There's also a [good post](https://archive.is/pKEjR) from a couple years back when the law was only being proposed.

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-psychological-abuse-law-a6789271.html

http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/dec/29/domestic-abuse-law-controlling-coercive-behaviour

Naturally the law is bullshit, that'll never be used against women, despite manipulation being their everything.""Honey you don't make enough money."" this kind of comment won't be considered and yet ""Honey, you're getting too fat."" Will be considered abuse, even though both comments could be said by either sex. You might thinking I'm crazy, but really, I was just watching women's TV, because I slept in late because of a cold, went and had my breakfast and lo and behold a DV ""victim"", complained about her husband of 8 years, literally it was him insulting her appearance and his general disapproval of her ""Getting dressed up and going out with the girls"", regardless of what he said, because honestly it sounds like something the feminist narrative write. Even then she just left, but now in hindsight it was DV.

Ultimately all this is down to feminism, money, globalism et cetera

I'm just gonna quit while I'm ahead and am not too angry. 

On a positive note, here is [Erin Pizzey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnUwxxijr3g), she created the first domestic violence shelter in the modern world, because she was concerned with DV itself, as opposed to man-hating feminism, it's a good video to watch and she's a genuinely lovely person.


**Lessons learned:** Brits need to think about expat, need to leave the west behind, if you're white go to a country that white worships, which is pretty much most of Asia.

**EDIT:** Here is the link to the video I watched this morning, [1:40](http://www.itv.com/thismorning/hot-topics/mental-abuse-coercive-control-the-hidden-side-of-domestic-violence) they ask her what was the pyschological abuse she suffered, that in her words was worse than the physical violence, the answer is he insulted her appearance, how she managed the children and the house, and going out with friends.

>The cross-Government definition of domestic violence and abuse outlines controlling or coercive behaviour as follows:

>Controlling behaviour is:a range of acts designed to make a person subordinate and/or dependent by isolating them from sources of support, exploiting their resources and capacities for personal gain, depriving them of the means needed for independence, resistance and escape and regulating their everyday behaviour.

>Coercive behaviour is:a continuing act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten their victim.”

>The perpetrator and victim have to be personally connected when the incidents took place-meaning that at the time the incidents took place they were in an intimate personal relationship (whether they lived together or not)or they lived together and were family members, or they lived together and had previously been in an intimate personal relationship.It is not necessary for the perpetrator and victim to stillbe cohabiting or in a relationship when the offence is reported as long as the incidents took place when they were “personally connected”, and after the offence came into force.If they were not personally connected, or the incidents took place after a relationship/cohabitation,the stalking and harassment legislation may apply",1004,4.0,0.2978000044822693,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
1005,88o247,"###After hours of research, I had found what I thought to be the perfect pickup line. I walked up to a beautiful girl and said, “Hey, I thought you were cute, and I had to say hi.” She smiled, said thank you, and we talked for a couple minutes until she paused and said, “It was nice to meet you,” and walked away. I never saw her again.

I’ve read dozens of books teaching men how to attract women with lines, tactics, and tricks. But after 10 years in the game, thousands of approaches, and yes, a good number of “lays” – I’ve found that attracting women isn’t something you can force. In fact, the harder you try to get a woman to like you, the less attractive you will be to her.

When that girl from the above example rejected me, I could have blamed it on the line I used. But truthfully, no matter what I said, the result would have been the same. This is because attraction isn’t something you do, it’s something you are.

Of all the times I attracted a woman, not once did I attract her because of some technique I used. Every single time, I attracted her because of who I was.

There’s a saying, “The self is always shining through.” Basically, no matter how hard you try to “make a girl like you” using some tactic, it won’t work because using a technique to attract a woman is in itself a form of overcompensation.

We only use techniques because on some level we don’t believe we’re good enough by default, so we try to make up for our inadequacy with a line or a trick(1).

I can’t teach you how attract a specific girl using techniques, but I CAN teach you how to be an attractive man who naturally draws women in.

There’s no quick-fix. Becoming the most attractive version of yourself requires that you invest both time and effort in yourself. But the end result is easily worth it. Over-time - by following the 4 tips in this article - you will become exponentially more appealing to the opposite sex.

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 1:
##Develop your Self-Confidence

&nbsp;

It’s no secret that self-confidence is attractive, but what is it, really?

If asked, most people would say, “Self-confidence is belief in yourself.” And that’s true, but there’s a key component missing in that definition.

Self-confidence isn’t just belief in yourself, it’s the belief that everything will turn out okay when you attempt something.

Self-confidence doesn’t mean you expect every girl to like you, it simply means that you’re okay with the consequences of taking a risk, even if the girl doesn’t like you.

When we lack self-confidence with women, we think that rejection is the worst thing that could happen to us. That fear causes us to filter ourselves in conversation, to adopt defensive body language, and even to speak with a weaker vocal tonality.

Our inner lack of confidence causes us to behave less attractively. The more confident you become, the more attractive you will be - because you’ll stop getting in your own way.

How do you actually do that? Well, how do we become confident in anything? Take driving for example. We become confident drivers by giving our brains proof that when we take the wheel, disaster will not ensue.

Every time we drive - and we live to tell the tale - we become a little more confident in ourselves as a driver. The same applies to dating. Every time you take a social risk, and come out the other side unharmed, you will become a little bit more confident.

For example, the more women you approach, the lower the stakes will feel when you walk up to a girl, because you’ll become comfortable with the possibility of getting rejected.

What this means will vary from person to person. For many guys just starting their journey, the first step to developing self-confidence will just be getting out of the house, for others it will be something bolder.

As you develop your self-confidence, you will become more attractive to women. Fortunately, if you utilize tip 4, the process of confidence building will largely take place automatically.

The most important take-aways from this are that you can’t fake confidence, and that it will take time to develop – BUT your level of confidence is completely under your control and improving it will make you more attractive.

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 2:
##Develop Standards

&nbsp;

The more women you’re willing to reject, the more attractive to women you will become. This is counter-intuitive, but it’s true.

If there is one thing that turns women off more than anything, it’s neediness. A guy acts needy when he is so desperate to be with a girl that no matter what she does or says, he would still sleep with her.

Neediness is suffocating. It shows that you take getting with a girl way too seriously and that you see yourself as incapable of getting another girl of her caliber if you wanted to.

Most of the guys I’ve met who have trouble attracting women (and there are many) have a problem with neediness. They see girls as a means to an end. They will happily sleep with any girl because that makes them feel like they “won”.

Men with this mindset don’t meet women to connect with another human being, but to get a sense of accomplishment from sleeping with a girl.

These guys don’t have standards for themselves. They see a hot girl as a prize to be won, so they are desperate to get her. Her personality is irrelevant. Her values are irrelevant.

When you see women as mere sex-objects, it’s impossible to have a real human interaction with them. And, naturally, a man who sees a woman as a human being is much more likely to attract her than a man who sees her as the fleshy equivalent of a gold coin.

The best way to eliminate this neediness that derives from seeing attractive women as prizes is to develop standards. Instead of being the guy who will do anything to get with the hot girl, you want to be the guy who’s interested in the hot girl but hasn’t decided if he wants to sleep with her yet.

Just like confidence, this can’t be faked. Pretending that you have standards by disqualifying a girl or negging her won’t make her see you as a high-status guy. You have to develop actual standards.

A good place to start is to make a clear list of what you won’t accept in a woman you’re considering dating (in whatever capacity). For reference, here’s a few of the things I won’t accept in a woman:

-If a girl has any kind of drug addiction, I’m out.

-If she’s unhealthily narcissistic, I’m out

-If she has a negative mindset, I’m out.

-If she is uninteresting, I’m out.

When I’m interacting with a woman, I’m screening her for the above traits. She might be a perfect ten in appearance, but if she’s narcissistic and uninteresting, I’m not going to sleep with her. To do so would be selling myself short.

The only reason I would sleep with that girl is because it would give me a sense of ego-gratification. I’d be doing it, so I could tell my friends about, not because to do so would actually be enjoyable.

In my experience, at least, sex is better when you actually like the person. Physical attraction is important, too, sure. But I’ve been with extremely beautiful women in the past who I didn’t have any chemistry with - and it was crappy.

Writing a list of the things you won’t tolerate in a potential sexual partner and rejecting women who don’t meet those standards is a powerful strategy for becoming more attractive to women. (Btw, it’s also useful to write a list of the things you do want in a partner.)

When you’re interacting with a beautiful woman and you’re willing to reject her depending on what she does and says, the entire dynamic changes. Instead of acting like a guy who would do anything to get laid, you will act like a guy who has an abundance of options.

Your non-neediness will make you infinitely more attractive than all the desperate guys pining after her. But this starts with taking a moment to write out what you want (and don’t want) in a girl you’re considering having a sexual relationship with.

&nbsp;

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 3:
##Improve your Appearance

&nbsp;

Looks matter. The better looking you are, the higher percentage of women will make it easy for you to pick them up. At the same time, no matter how unattractive you are, some percentage of women will be attracted to you if are confident, non-needy, etc. (and that percentage is probably higher than you think).

There are two important misconceptions about looks that must be cleared up:

-Waiting to get in shape before meeting women is a silly idea.
-Your looks matter, but they don’t exist in a vacuum.

A lot of guys realize that looks matter, so they decide that once they’ve got their looks “handled” they’ll start approaching women. This is problematic because it can easily turn into a form of procrastination. Your appearance is something that you can constantly improve, but you’ll never reach a particular point where you’ve “made it”. Furthermore, improving your looks won’t make game easy. I’ve seen numerous good-looking guys fail at game. These guys expect their looks to do all the work for them, but truth is you still have to be very confident and assertive to succeed with women.

The vast majority of guys don’t have the confidence necessary to take a woman home, and that’s something you can only develop through practice. Thinking you look good helps, but it’s not magically going to make you comfortable with social risk taking –(if only it were that simple).

Improve your appearance while also improving your social skills. It’s not one or the other, it’s both. Focusing on your looks while neglecting to actually interact with women is a recipe for failure.

Social skills, confidence, and physical attractiveness are all important when it comes to dating, don’t sell yourself short by improving one and neglecting the others. To do so would be as silly as learning how to shoot in basketball, but not how to dribble or pass.

That said, you can make a staggering improvement in your appearance in the course of a single day. Get a high-end salon haircut. Buy some clothes that fit well and don’t make you look like you live in your mother’s basement. Simply dressing better and having a sense of style will make you more substantially more attractive. It’s not going to make up for a lack of confidence and experience, but it’s a good start. And really, 95% of guys in the seduction community have plenty of room to improve their style.

I’m no expert on fashion, but here are a couple resources you can look at to get started with:

http://masculine-style.com/rugged-refined-and-rakish/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiAubtXLnFs

Obviously, when it comes to improving your looks, style is only half the battle. There’s no reason not to be in good shape. If you’re not already working out regularly, the easiest way to start is to go to the gym with a friend of yours who’s already in good shape.

Having a gym buddy will help keep you accountable to working out even when you don’t feel motivated. Plus, if your friend is in good shape, they’ll be able to help provide you with guidance.

If you don’t have a friend who can help you, there’s an unlimited number of fitness guides you can download. Find someone you resonate with and trust and follow their plan. If you have trouble being consistent, get a trainer to hold you accountable and provide guidance.

&nbsp;

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 4:
##Treat Dating Like A Skill

&nbsp;

Whatever you want to accomplish in life, there are certain elements that are outside of your control. - If you want to be a doctor, a low IQ is a disadvantage that’s outside your control. - If you want to get rich, having a poor family is disadvantage that’s outside your control. - If you want to date beautiful women, factors like your height, race, etc. can be disadvantages that are outside your control.

Dating coaches who say factors like your race and height don’t matter are lying. Sure, they matter, but they’re out of your control: worrying about them is only going to hurt you.

When you tell yourself, “Girls don’t like Asians,” you’re going to see your interactions with women through that lens. If you walk up to a girl, and she rejects you, you’re going to say, “It’s because I’m Asian. If I were white that wouldn’t have happened.”

This narrative becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When you’re interacting with a woman, and you expect her not to like you, you’ll act different than if you expect her to like you. Your insecurities will show up in your behavior, and when she rejects you, you’ll think, “It’s because I’m Asian.” Then you’ll become even more insecure, women will like you even less, and so on.

You can’t change your race, but you can change many of the other factors that create sexual attraction. The guy who wants to get rich but has a poor family can work twice as hard as his competition, and within a few years he can get to a point where he’s making a six-figure income.

Similarly, a short Asian guy with a below average face can succeed with women IF he works twice as hard as his competition and focuses on the factors that are under his control. His level of self-confidence is under his control, his style and fitness are under his control, and his ability to take social risks is under his control.

Look, with the above example, I said that the guy with a poor family could make six-figures, I didn’t say he can become a billionaire. Being a billionaire probably requires a certain amount of luck, the right family, being born in right time and place, the right genetics, etc.

But anyone can make six-figures with enough time and effort. The same is true in dating. If you’re naturally a four on a looks scale, I can’t promise that you’ll be able to date Victoria’s Secret models, but you can still bat way out of your league and hook up with attractive girls.

By treating dating as a skillset, you can date higher quality women than you would otherwise. If you fixate on whether you can get “perfect tens” you’re just going to cause yourself frustration.

We have these fantasies, whether it’s to be a billionaire or to sleep with “10s”. These fantasies stifle us because they’re so far outside of our reality. Worry about pulling “10s” when you can already pull “9s” easily. Treat dating like a skillset by taking it one step at a time. Don’t spend much time learning how to build attraction when you still have crippling approach anxiety.

-I know a guy who’s great at getting women attracted to him, but he always chokes by leaving the interaction before anything sexual can happen. He would massively improve his results if he focused on leading interactions forward by inviting the girl to the dance floor, to another area, etc.

-I know another guy who is great at opening girls, but he’s so quiet they don’t pay attention to him. He would gain so much by working on his volume.

 -I know a third guy who is great at dating girls who aren’t particularly attractive. But he won’t even approach girls who he thinks are pretty. He’s unnecessarily limiting himself to only date women that are far worse looking than he is!

I could give countless examples like the above. No, these guys can’t change their race, but they can learn to lead interactions forward, to speak louder, or to approach more attractive women.

In dating, there countless factors that are under your control. Worrying about the things outside your control is silly when there are so many things you can proactively improve on.

Don’t think about your race, think about your confidence. Don’t think about your height, think about your inability to approach attractive women.

Treat dating as a skill, and you can improve your results dramatically. Treat it like something entirely based on your genetics, and you’ll just drown yourself in self-pity.

&nbsp;

###Skill Only Comes with Practice

&nbsp;

The other key to treating dating like a skill, is to practice. If you spent 5 hours a week reading about how to pass a basketball, but never went out and played the game, people would think you’re an idiot.

Yet it’s common for guys to spend dozens- if not hundreds - of hours learning about how to attract women, without going out into the world and practicing. Intellectual learning is only useful if you’re spending most of your time in the real world getting real feedback.

Imagining what a good basketball shot looks like is completely different from taking the actual shot. Similarly, imagining what a good approach looks like is completely different from doing the approach. Information is only helpful to provide some guidance, it can’t do the work for you. Only real practice can.

It’s a lot easier to read about picking up women than it is to actually do it. I know this as well as anyone. When I first learned about the seduction community, I spent over a year watching videos without doing a single approach. Was it helpful? No. If anything, my social skills got worse because I became so overanalytical. Learning how to attract women without practicing is just as absurd as trying to learn any other skill without practicing.

Treating dating like a skillset is difficult. It takes patience, time, and effort to do so. Here are some resources that can help you if you get stuck:

This books both give you a step-by-step strategy for going out, meeting women, and developing your pickup skillset:

##Conclusion: How To Be An Attractive Man

&nbsp;

There you have it, how to be an attractive man. Any of the four tips can change your life individually, but master all four and you won’t believe the successes you’ll have.

Reading is how to do this is the easy part, becoming more attractive to women is a long-term process. Remember, anyone who tells you it’s going to be easy - that you can use some “hack” to succeed with women – is more interested in making money than in helping you improve.

Changing your life is hard, but what’s the alternative? Approaching women can be painful, but not nearly as painful as it would be to settle for a woman you’re not happy with because “she was the best you could get” (which is what the majority of men end up doing).

Fortunately, most of the factors that make a man attractive to women are under your control. If you’re willing to treat dating like a skill, you can master it.

""I had always thought of woman as possessing those delicate qualities of mind and soul that made her in her respects far superior to man.
I had put her on a lofty pedestal, figuratively speaking, and ranked her in certain important attributes considerably higher than man.
I worshipped at the feet of the creature I had raised to this height, and, like every true worshiper, I felt myself unworthy of the object of my worship.

But all this was in the past. Now the soft voiced gentle woman of my reverent worship has all but vanished. In her place has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies on making herself as much as possible like man - in dress, voice, and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind.
The world has experience many tragedies, but to my mind the greatest tragedy of all is the present economic condition wherein women strive against men, and in many cases actually succeed in usurping their places in the professions and in industry.
This growing tendency of women to overshadow the masculine is a sign of a deteriorating civilization. 

Practically all the great achievements of man until now have been inspired by his love and devotion to woman. Man has aspired to great things because some woman believed in him, because he wished to command her admiration and respect. For these reasons he has fought for her and risked his life and his all for her time and time again.

Perhaps the male in society is useless. I am frank to admit that I don't know. If women are beginning to feel this way about it - and there is striking evidence at hand that they do - then we are entering upon the cruelest period of the world's history.

Our civilization will sink to a state like that which is found among the bees, ants, and other insects - a state wherein the male is ruthlessly killed off. In this matriarchal empire which will be established, the female rules. As the female predominates, the males are at her mercy. The male is considered important only as a factor in the general scheme of the continuity of life.

The tendency of women to push aside man, supplanting the old spirit of cooperation with him in all the affairs of life, is very disappointing to me.""",1006,4.0,0.4408000111579895,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

1010,f9buqh,"So I’ll be the first to admit that I get curious. Sometimes like to see the perspective of the other half  , and since FDS is basically the redpill “equivalent” (I use this term lightly, that sub is a shithole) of TRP,  I check it out from time to time. Lo and behold, they prove our point for us. 

Currently there’s a pinned thread telling women how to detect “Big dick energy”, meaning how to detect if a dude will be good in bed, which basically translates to “high smv dude”, there’s a list of signs to look for and things to avoid, and i’ll go through it point by point and translate it, showing how it proves RP theorem true. 


&gt; The men that I found were skilled in bed ALL had these key traits in common:

&gt;They were always pretty athletic indicating good energy and a desire to improve / maintain themselves (I know this might be negotiable for others- but this was my experience across the board). I could make out their physique before the top was off 

TRANSLATION- Hit the gym and get in shape motherfuckers, a fundemental principle of TRP.  Literally the first point listed is also the first thing instructed to noobs on asktrp. 

&gt;They had a quiet confidence- inspired curiosity/sexual prowess- not bending over backwards being corny and desperate or trying to neg me (they knew better than that, indicating they don't struggle with women, insecurity or suffer from a lack of options/rejection). Neither did they have something to PrOvE.

TRANSLATION- Abundance mentality and outcome independence, classic sidebar material. 

&gt;They had lively energetic characters- knew how to shmooze the room with little effort - a natural charisma. Tell it how it is kinda people- without being a condescending asshole overstepping the mark. Playful, light-hearted men....again indicating they're not some resentful bitter insecure depraved gormless incel that hasn't been laid in 6months. Even if they're more on the stoic side- they still have a good sense of humour/charisma shining through. There's a level-headed temperament to them. 

TRANSLATION- Cocky funny, natural banter kind of guy, stuff that men on here are constantly taught to be when interacting with a women whom you’re sexually interested in. Social adeptness too, another high smv trait. 

 &gt;They were witty and fast on the ball- they could ping my sarcasm back at me at the speed of light without any whiff of fear (This is a VERY big giveaway indicating intellect/sharpness and ability to learn fast). Basically they didn't resent my (often blunt) sharp sense of humour and borderline insults poking at them- instead they humoured it and bounced it back in good nature- again showing they don't have a fragile sense of masculinity, aren't insecure and are used to dealing with confident women. This of course made me wonder why they're NOT thrown off so easily or having some butt-hurt response- hmmmm curious! With disappointing men- there's always a hint of resentment behind that- like they think you're too cocky or they're just a little thrown off (THEY SMELL FEAR they may disappoint).

TRANSLATION- KNOW HOW TO IDENTIFY AND PASS A SHIT TEST. This one should really go without saying, its funny, you really couldn’t make this shit up. 

&gt;They were good at reading me fast and what I like. They'd sometimes finish my sentences or guess my reply, like 'I knew you were going to say that'. Or they'd suggest something I would be into and guess it correctly. Observant and intuitive, indicating they read body language well.

TRANSLATION- Social awareness, what more do I have to say? 

&gt;They weren't thirsty, or awkward- they took it at my pace and knew how to read signals and when to strike. They definitely will NOT escalate crude sex talk fast if you met them on an app- these men know you're gonna want to sniff them out first and can hold interesting conversation but they may drop a few compliments here &amp; there: they're not rookies going to scare you off or become borderline insulting. They know better than to do that. Plus they also want to sniff you out for chemistry. They were still respectful and waiting for me to give them the sign, that way they knew I wanted it. Respect is key here- competent men know not to force themselves where they're unwanted or harass you- they have enough confidence not to act desperate. Again- big sign he's experienced with women, respects boundaries and knows what they expect from him. respected in order to feel comfortable and trust him in the bedroom. 

TRANSLATION- Again, outcome independence is crucial pillar of solid game, as well as being able to read and respond to IOI’s. 


&gt;They were assertive but not in an overly brash belittling kind of way. They had a natural instinct to take charge. They did NOT need instructions to be told to do something. These men have a certain level of intelligence to pick up on that without you needing to indicate. They leap to action which has some kind of hot protective guardian vibe, like they can keep watch for you. INSTINCT is the key here. They sensed when I wanted something doing. Again this translates to the bedroom as they'll know what they're doing and be enthusiastic to do it. They aren't shy or hesitant and will communicate directly. There's no hassle or tension indicating things will run equally as smooth in the bedroom.

TRANSLATION- “We want a dominant masculine man to take charge and lead/escalate.” Here at the red pill we are instructed that as the MEN it is our duty to be the one in control of the interaction when dealing with women. 

&gt;The BIG one: they were not lazy 'chilled' 'laidback' 'I like taking the easy, familiar route' kind of characters. They had a zest for life which gave off the vibe they led a satisfying life which is attractive and not lacking in some dept. It indicated they like keeping up pace and variety- not letting their life get dull, monotonous or boring. They are passionate motivated people, usually have a decent career/ interests, like travelling and are pretty upbeat. They have interesting things to talk about, and some depth to them (someone with depth /eager to improve will do their homework on how to please women)

TRANSLATION- “We like men who have a strong sense of purpose and a desire to live a high value life to the fullest.”  TRP encourages us to find our mission in life and cultivate an interesting lifestyle and hobbies, live such a lifestyle and women will be a byproduct. 

I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if one of you motherfuckers was just pretending to be a woman and typing this up. Regardless, this goes to show that TRP is truth, straight from the horses mouth.

1011,78ed3f,"Read a post early that got me thinking. Guy wrote an angry rant saying how all women are whores. 

My first thought. If all women are whores for you. That must be a good thing right? So why the anger? 

...oh because they are not YOUR whores. If they were there would be no issue. 

Most of you who have internalized the sidebar understand that it’s just our turn. They can never be our whores. So the only reason that can upset you is because of the ego. 

But there’s more to this. The problem isn’t them being whores. Because in reality. They are not all whores (at least not as the post read.) They are just AWALT. 

The problem is YOU. You’re calling her a whore because she left you to go fuck someone else. That’s not the issue though. She did it for a reason and the reasons are usually one or more of the 3. 

1. Your value/status sucks. 
2. Your  frame sucks. 
3  Your Attitude/life sucks.

**Value**

If you are a top tier male most women are not going to do anything to fuck up and potentially lose you. When I date women they tip toe when making a questionable decision. They make sure before they do something it’s not going to piss me off. Why? Because most guys fucking suck. Honestly. It’s laughable how little the competition is. They’re all out of shape. They haven’t heard of the word game besides talking about halo and world of war craft. Frame doesn’t even make sense to them. They dress like shit , Orbiting is a hobby, and needy as fuck, my god these dudes are so fucking needy (I hear women constantly complain about it). So as long as you form your life around the principles in the sidebar (that you see fitting for your mission) you’re way ahead of the game. 

If these women are doing things to piss you off so easily it’s a good indication your value or status is shitty and you have work to do. Because I’m telling you. If you are in decent shape. Have a purpose in life. Maximize your attraction. And know game. MOST women have never experienced a guy like you. They usually don’t want to fuck that up especially if they have been in past relationships that were shit. That doesn’t mean they never will but again if you’re a man of value you will have no issue creating a boundary or stopping that shit dead in its tracks. 

They are never going to be the ones giving YOU an ultimatum. If your given an ultimatum. She’s subtly telling you. Your value is shit. Take it as a blessing and lesson learned. Say goodbye and get back to the drawing boards. (Aka working on yourself.)

**Frame**

Your frame sucks. You care too much. You’re overly invested. She knows. You know it. We know it. Everyone knows it. If you were to take full responsibility for everything in your life. You’d never have the nerve to call her a whore out of frustration because you realize she’s just a women being a woman and you’re the reason this behavior took place. 

Now I know someone’s going to say even the best of the best get cheated on sometimes. And yes it does happen but usually they are missing something. Or did something for it to happen. In the rare occasion she cheats on a high value man who has all his shit together. they aren’t wasting a fucking second crying, moaning, or ridiculing the women for it. They are already on to the next one. 

All women are like that. They all have women instinct. They can and may cheat. We are aware of it but we don’t need to live in paranoia because of it. If you have your shit together like I said above it’s unlikely she’s going to jump on the next better dick and fuck things up with you. Especially if she knows you’ll leave Or you have created firm boundaries. 

**Attitude/life**

If you’re going around calling women whores. It’s a good indication your attitude sucks. You’re like the girl who whines about her ex to the new dude she’s dating. The guy she’s cheating on you with or “whoring” herself with is usually fun as fuck. Carefree. Living life by his own rules. Showing her a time she’s never had before. 

I have alpha widowed almost every girl I have been with (I know this sounds concede . But I’d like to give some personal examples). This is because I am a fun mother fucker. I always try to live that way. I don’t like rules. I used to get into a lot of trouble. I was wild. I’ve matured over the years to keep myself out of trouble but I’m still wild at heart. 

I take the women I meet to shoot guns they will never get to touch again in their lives. I show up randomly at their house at 2 am to fuck their brains out. I call them tell them get ready we’re going to have some fun. I take them to abandon places to explore then fuck them in them. I fuck them in their cars. In parking lots. On roofs. In playgrounds. Hang cuff Them while fucking them. Where ever/however I can that no other guy would ever think of doing. 

I do shit that makes them nervous as fuck. All the while I stay calm and laugh. Sneak into places you shouldn’t be. Sneak into movies. Sneak into their rents house. Fuck her in the bathroom at the grocery store. The dressing room at the mall. You name it I’ve tried it. 

Now think about that. If you’re a guy doing all this shit. HOW in the fuck is she ever going to replace your crazy ass. She can try. But like I said if she’s been with some shitty guys she’s going to be blown the fuck away. Not even chad can get her to cheat. And if she does. I mean honestly at this point you won’t care. You’ll have an abundance mentality thats untouchable. 

The key is to always be having fun with a dgaf attitude towards anything that isn’t helping you get to where you  want to be. Get out of your comfort zone. Experience new shit and be happy you’re able too. Make your life as interesting as possible and you won’t have time to waste worrying about people who bring negativity into your life. 

Life’s too short to call women whores. Life’s too short to even care. You’re Attitude should be. Fun. Free. Fuck it! 

TL:DR women aren’t whores. Unless you’re the high value fun guy. Otherwise Women are just women. It’s YOU that sucks. Not her. Fix yourself.

1012,6fnv2f,"GitHub is a software hosting website which many programmers use, particularly in the free/open source communities. The company seems to have branched out into producing other products that programmers use. It's all very hip and trendy, far removed from the traditional socially awkward hacker programming in some basement.

Recently they put out a call for speakers for a technical conference about some programming framework that they've set up. After the blind review process, the speakers were selected and published. So far, so good.

Then one woman notices that all of the speakers are men. She posts about this on Twitter [1]. The conference organisers respond by cancelling the conference, stating that the speaker list ""does not reflect the standards to which we hold ourselves."" and that they are ""postponing this event until we can deliver a more diverse slate of speakers"" [2]. So those speakers who were selected based purely on their merits? Not enough vagina.

I'm a professional programmer and I can tell you that it takes a ""special"" kind of person to be a really good programmer. Borderline autistic is a good start. One requires the ability to focus on the task at hand which such strength for hours at a time. And, of course, it requires an extremely logical brain. You can probably guess that all of the best programmers that have ever been are men.

Of course, some exceptional women will also display these talents. But they are rare. And even when they do appear, they often cause drama in the communities they take part in. Sarah Sharp was a Linux kernel maintainer. But she couldn't handle the brutal way in which other maintainers often communicate with each other. In these communities respect is something that has to be earned and if you don't deserve it, you will be told straight in no uncertain terms. Anyway, she ended up publicly quitting.

The sad thing about all this is that it is the male developers who will suffer. Employers are incredibly eager to hire female programmers. This always creates more work for the competent ones. And now it's harder for men to speak at conferences. There are literally no barriers to becoming a programmer. You just need a computer, which virtually everyone in a developed country has access to, and discipline. Given the extremely low barriers to entry, you would think that there would be plenty of competent female programmers. Or maybe they just aren't good at it, or aren't interested enough to become good. Who knows...

1013,32gcqe,"While men and women are very different, one thing we have in common is that the majority of us are **terrible**. 90% of women are basic bitches whose lives revolve around Netflix, wine, shopping, and naps. But we often forget that 90% of men are fuckboys who have no vision beyond videogames, televised sports, smoking weed, and trying to keep their dicks slick. We fault women as boring and banal but too often neglect ourselves.

The kneejerk response is that we’re all unplugged individuals. We’re miles ahead of Joe Beta eating cheetohs on the couch. But the unfortunate truth is that TRP consists mainly of Reformed Betas, and chances are most of us spent high school and college locked in our rooms studying or playing video games; which in terms of cultivating individual character and force of personality is pretty fucking terrible. Without real life experience, too often these guys express themselves through pop-culture references and define themselves by the media they consume. They lack an original, self-actualized identity.

Almost every day I see newly unplugged guys wondering how they can become more interesting and make conversation. Most of TRP is pretty straightforward: lift, read, approach. There’s an endless amount of information on how to lift weights, along with a wealth of resources in the sidebar on RP theory and game. But what do you do if you have the chiseled body and iron frame, but nothing inside? ***Many guys here already have rich and fulfilling lives. This post is not for you.*** This is for all the newbies who hit /r/asktrp wondering how to make friends. 

**Hobbies, interests, and experiences**

These three things make up the foundation of who we are. Women might be judged solely on how they look, but men are judged on WHAT THEY DO. *What do you do? What do you like to do? What have you already done? What do you plan on doing?* Either directly or indirectly, people will ask you these questions and you must have satisfactory answers. If the answer to all these questions is Xbox and jerking off then you’re doing it wrong. 

**HOBBIES**

These are activities you do regularly with TANGIBLE results. “Playing videogames” is not a hobby. Neither is watching sports, drinking beers, or hanging out with your bros. There is nothing inherently wrong with these activities, but in the end you haven’t achieved anything substantial. We fault party girls for endlessly pursuing good times without contributing or developing anything. While lounging on the porch lacks the glamour and excitement of recreational drugs and club music, it’s ultimately just as frivolous. Hobbies are more analogous to skills, rooted in pragmatism with tangible benefits. **Women don't worry about this because they are all born with a vital skill: SEX**

It is imperative that you cultivate several hobbies and work on them regularly. That is, at least once a week -- preferably more often -- you dedicate time towards the pursuit of each hobby. How many people do you know that “play guitar” but haven’t touched one in months if not years? If they even still own one.
 
To develop a well-rounded personality, you must pursue at least one hobby from each of the three cardinal spheres: **The Physical, The Creative, and The Mental**.

**THE PHYSICAL**: These are activities that strengthen your body and increase your stamina. At least three times a week you should be engaging in a physical activity. The very minimum requirement is weightlifting, the quintessential “lift more” of TRP. But often that’s not enough. Every lame half-alpha out in the wild fucks around at the gym, and for top-tier guys a weightlifting regimen is all but mandatory. A true physical hobby goes beyond mere maintenance of your physique. These are activities like snowboarding, rock climbing, boxing, and cycling. Even conventional sports like basketball -- if you take it seriously. Pushing your body to its limits and developing your natural agility, power, and grace. We might not be chasing down mammoths any more but you can still be a hunter and warrior.
 
If it is your sole source of exercise then three times a week is mandatory. If it supplements weightlifting or calisthenics, then once a week is acceptable. It’s not just about strengthening your body, but adding another layer to your personality. “I’m hitting the slopes over break. I just ran a marathon last weekend. Let’s ball after work.” You will have a hardness and appeal to you that most people lack. 

**THE CREATIVE**: These are activities that result in tangible pieces of aesthetic work. Drawing, painting, music, sculpture, singing, and so on. Most people believe that artistic ability is innate, but really it’s a matter of practice and commitment. Just like lifting and game, there are myriad resources available for you to improve in the media of your choice. As with The Physical, creative hobbies need to be practiced at least three times a week. 

That isn’t to say that multiple times a week you need to painstakingly hew Greco-Roman deities from living marble. Just as there are light and heavy workouts, there are smaller and larger sessions. For example, I’m a painter. I dedicate a single day during the week in which I go to the studio, turn my phone off, and spend a few hours painting. The rest of the week I just work in my sketchbook: drawing, sketching, and generally brainstorming. Likewise, maybe you only go to a voice coach once a week, but the rest of the time you practice your scales at home. Not every session is monumental, but you consistently make progress. If you can commit to those three weekly sessions, you’ll be surprised at how quickly you improve and how proficient you become. If you spend money on private lessons or take a class at the local college you’ll progress even faster, with the bonus of meeting young liberal females ;)

You don’t need to be a Renaissance artist to satisfy this hobby. Creative writing and poetry are equally excellent. Woodworking is rustic and timeless. Photography and graphic design are also viable options that are more modern and accessible, although significant effort is required to elevate yourself above the many amateurs.

**THE MENTAL**: Another word for this sphere would be The Technical or The Intellectual. The Physical will strengthen your body and The Creative will refine your aesthetic, but you need to challenge your mind in order to complete the trinity. There are overlaps between Mental hobbies and Interests (which I will mention shortly), but remember that the defining aspect of a hobby is that it provides tangible benefit. While reading about history and playing chess are certainly intellectual pursuits, ultimately you don’t achieve much besides knowing more about history and getting better at chess.

Mental hobbies are things such as coding, mechanics, and foreign languages. They can be financial pursuits such as real estate or managing a business. On a more Machiavellian level, it can even include human psychology and manipulation. They all require intelligence, study, and practice, but are useful and applicable. You can build your own website or design a new app. Save hundreds of dollars maintaining your own vehicle. TRP often recommends travel; consider how much more autonomous you will be and how much richer your experience when you have multiple means of communication at your disposal. Out of the three spheres, Mental hobbies most directly translate into utility and profit. 

***

These categories are not set in stone. There is plenty of overlap between the spheres. Dance blends the physical and the creative. Cooking and baking blend the creative and mental. Martial arts combine the mental and physical. **Even something as mundane as gardening contains elements from all three areas**. The key is to become a well-rounded individual who can contribute in multiple ways. 

**INTERESTS**

Interests and hobbies are often confused. While there are similarities, the main difference is that interests are pursued on their own merit. You engage in them solely because of their appeal to you. Hobbies are constrained through their practical application, but interests are far more open ended. However, most interests have zero practicality; you need a different mindset when you pursue interests versus hobbies.

The ""point"" of having diverse interests is allowing you to contribute to conversations. That’s it. Yes you can pull the sitcom routine and try to memorize various trivia on a subject so you can fake expertise, but your conversations will be far more natural, organic, and fulfilling if you have real knowledge of whatever topic you are discussing. *To be an interesting person you need to discuss interesting things; to discuss interesting things you need to have knowledge on interesting things.*

What do you do for fun? What interests or excites you? Answering these questions is crucial to determining what you want to pursue. Nature and the outdoors. Punk rock. Floral arrangement. Archaeology. Tarot readings. Classic literature. Tropical fish. Horror movies. Modern art. Taxidermy. Deep house. American history. Board games. Tantric philosophy. Magic tricks. Rock collecting. German expressionism. Astronomy. Hog futures. Interior design. **Your options are endless**. This is such a simple and basic concept but many people lack the basic desire to broaden their horizons. Ask your plates about *any* of these topics and watch their eyes glaze over. 

Take initiative and pursue your interests actively. You can’t passively sit through life waiting for opportunities to explore. Just like anything else on TRP, read, learn, and spend time on them.  If you don’t know where to begin, don’t forget that any of the hobbies mentioned in the previous section are automatic interests. They naturally lend themselves to other areas of knowledge. If you’re a cyclist, then you already know about cycling. You can discuss different bikes, routes, and maintenance, but it’s so easy to expand from cycling into environmental impact, public transit, kinesiology, health benefits, city planning, triathlons, and mechanics.

However, not all interests are created equal. Videogames get a lot of shit on TRP, but videogames are a legitimate interest. You can spend time and money on them, you can discuss them, and they bring enjoyment to your life. But when men on TRP talk shit about videogames, it comes from a place of truth. For practical purposes, **NO** women want to hear you talk about videogames. **None of them. Ever**. What you do on your own time is your business. If they help you unwind, God bless. But understand that certain things have a negative connotation that you may want to distance yourself from. If your primary goal is sexual strategy, it is imperative you keep that in mind. Regardless of how lame or sexy your interests are, they should all contribute to your overall frame of reference. Think of “water cooler talk”. 
Even if videogames aren’t hot, you can still connect with people who play them. 

The key here is to not separate and categorize hobbies and interests, but to pursue them in concert and combine them in interesting ways. For example, if your physical hobby is rock climbing and one of your interests is nature and the outdoors, then every month you go camping with all your gear and climb during the day while sleeping under the stars at night. Doing that is much more interesting than simply going to an indoor climbing gym and walking through the woods behind your house. You create something greater than the sum of its individual parts. These kinds of combinations lead into the third aspect of personality.

**EXPERIENCES**

It's very easy to fall into a routine of work-gym-eat-sleep-repeat. You sustain yourself – even stay healthy - but are you really living? Even if you pursue all the hobbies and interests mentioned earlier, you could still spend your entire life in a 10-mile bubble. You need to go out and experience LIFE. 9 times out of 10, if a newbie isn’t making any progress it’s because he’s spending too much time reading and not enough time doing.

Climb a mountain. Tag a watertower. Trip on acid in the desert under a full moon. Party in Ibiza. Get in a fight. Sneak backstage at a concert. Go skydiving. Date a sugar mama. Volunteer at the shelter. Backpack across Asia. Wrestle a large animal. Go to Gay Pride. Learn to backflip. Spend a night on the streets. Take two dates to the same party. Run with the bulls. Hike the Pacific Crest Trail. Go streaking. 

Note that some of these activities are HORRENDOUSLY stupid. But that’s the great thing about experiences, they are EXPERIENCE. And even the bad ones make you a stronger, more interesting person. Internalize the good. Learn from the bad. This is part of the reason why girls love bikers, criminals, gangsters, and dealers. They’re doing stuff. They’re exciting. They’re dangerous. I can hear the girls getting wet from here. Even if in the grand scheme of things these guys are in a shitty position, **girls would rather have fun in the dirt than stay clean and bored on the couch**. Girls would rather share an Alpha than own a Beta.

Again, this is all obvious shit. But if you never venture out of your comfort zone, you will never grow and develop as a human being.  However, it’s not about running around like a headless chicken trying to do as much wacky shit as possible. Yes, in the grand scheme you can travel all around the world collecting notches and accolades, but in the mundane, day-to-day aspect you also need to maintain an active social life. One of the more common questions I see from new subscribers is how to meet girls once they graduate college. *These guys have trouble because they don’t make an effort*. You can be The Most Interesting Man in the World, but you still need to put yourself out there.

Many men enter ""accidental monk mode"". I've been guilty of it myself. You read the literature, you hit the gym, get your career on track, and focus on your hobbies. But since a social life isn't spoon fed to you like it was in high school or college you never go out unless someone drags you. Sometimes it's because your social network is in shambles, sometimes it's because porn and videogames are convenient and available. Before you know it a month goes by and you're in a dry spell.

If you want a social life you have to WORK for it. Guys complain about never meeting girls, but if they were going to house parties, concerts, doing co-ed athletics, hitting the bars, perfecting their online game, and just generally expanding their social circle, you'd hear a lot less complaining. But that's hard. It's a lot easier to make excuses. **One of the core tenets of TRP is that you as a man are not entitled to anything**. That includes having a good time.

The next post will discuss developing a sense of humor, becoming more charismatic, and being mindful of the company you keep.

1014,cs3i2d,"I used to only buy expensive sunglasses. Oakleys, Ray Bans, Maui Jims etc. 

I would buy one pair at a time, and every. single. time. something bad would happen to them. 

One pair broke. One pair was stolen. One pair got sat on. One pair got scratched up.

Every time I would get angry as I felt the financial impact of my poor decisions, fuck ups and shitty luck. Sometimes a pair had been discontinued and I would never see them again.

I loved and lost pair after pair. The brutal cycle seemed infinite.

Then one day, when I had lost my latest pair, I was at a festival and someone handed me a cheap pair of promotional sunglasses. 

Suddenly I saw the world through brand new lenses.

I took the new shades home. Wore them in my car. Tossed them across the room with reckless abandon. I scratched them, and didn’t care. This was great!

I did not care. Not caring was nice. I fell in love with not caring.

Then one day I wore them out to party. I had a blast. I was relaxed with nothing to worry about. 

I woke up the next morning and my glasses were gone. Oh well... wait... what is that??

That horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach came back. I had grown attached to this pair just like the old.

I thought I had found the solution to rid myself of this pain and anxiety. What could I do? 

MY sunglasses I loved so much were gone. I could fix this.

So I went online and found myself another cheap pair of wayfarers and all was good in the universe - or so I thought.

Then the first time I went out drinking, I felt a concern to protect my sunglasses. Why wouldn’t this feeling go away???

Somebody would pick them up off the counter and put them on, I would get angry and protective. But these were cheap sunglasses, what gives? I thought I didn’t care. 

One time someone put them on and broke them. I was irrationally mad. 

Then it hit me. I should buy multiple pairs! That way if anything happens to one pair, I would always have a backup.

I bought multiple pairs of the same style and things got a little bit better.

This was years ago. Over time I have become a collector cheap sunglasses. Every time I see a pair I like, I make a small investment and pick them up. I toss them around, sit on them, throw them on the ground and break them if I feel so inclined.

One day I wear wayfarers, one day it’s aviators, one day it’s something a little more sporty. It’s always different, always interesting, and always low stress. 

I have so many pairs I gladly give them out to my friends. It ain’t no fun, if the homies can’t have none. 

Life is grand. Stay shady.",1014,0.0,0.5432000160217285,"girl, feel, really, find, still, shit, male, always, leave, relationship"
1015,7ze8ua,"I.                     **Newbie stage: what is this aggressive fantasy shit?**

The average newcomer is probably a young man, out of shape, n-count below 5, addicted to porn and ready to jump through hoops and into a relationship for the first sweet chubby girl who will suck his dick. We’ve all been like this.


Newbie starts lurking at the sub and at first is disgusted by the *women-bashing* that goes against his core values. The language is for sure very direct and vulgar, and the stories about how these hot college girls were competing to suck the cock of this older guy are really hard to believe.. “What a bunch of fake-macho assholes, they’re probably all virgins and this is fantasy world”, he thinks. Yet something rings true in these stories and for whatever reason, he keeps coming back to the sub.


**Lesson learned at this stage:** what brought you to TheRedPill is obviously you natural craving for pussy, but also humility. It’s hard to admit that a lot of things you have been taught are wrong, and that you actually don’t know shit. Humility is necessary for growth, without humility you wouldn’t have found TRP. Keep this in mind for the future, when you stop being humble you stop growing.


**Risk**: the risk at this stage is to hold on for dear life to your bluepill mindset and to your ego, and reject the redpill without actually taking the time to dig in a little.




**

 

II.                   **The truth sinks in like a dark cloud**


You’ve tried to resist the Truth, because it’s ugly and cold, and it doesn’t sit well with you. But the Truth doesn’t care about your feelings, it just is. Sure, in the upcoming weeks you will apply redpill principles and will be amazed to see them work so well, but you already know it’s the Truth even before you have had the chance to test it: Briffault’s law, the Hamster, female love vs male love, it just hits you in the face and you can’t escape it.


Let’s be fair, this is all VERY depressing. You enter the anger phase. Fuck this society and these lies. Fuck women, I hate them! What’s the point of living this masquerade? You recall all the instances when you thought a woman was actually caring about you, when she was in fact using you. You cringe at the recent memories of bluepill you acting like a doormat.


**Lesson learned at this stage:** Life in itself is no fairy tale. Swallowing the pill and learning the truth doesn’t make you happier, actually it’s the opposite at first, it makes you sadder. 


**Risk**: The risk is to give in to this desperate state, and say “fuck everything, I’ll just stay home and wank to porn and play video games”. You blame your thirst for pussy, and declare you don’t need women. Problem is, it’s not really about pussy in the end. Blue pill society has made you believe that it’s ok to be weak and the lowest version of yourself.  But now TRP teaches you that women won’t get wet for that, rightfully so. If you don’t want to improve and be the best you can be, just admit it and don’t lie to yourself by saying it’s about not wanting pussy. No, it’s about not wanting to grow. Looking at you, the angry half of MGTOW.


**
 

III.                 **Ooh so now women want me? I fucking hate them. And those amogging alphas too**


A few weeks in, you’ve hit the gym and the first gains are showing fast. Thank god for this boost of confidence, because the rest is much slower: it takes time to internalize everything. You try to act Alpha but you only end up looking like a dick, because it comes from a place of anger rather than confidence.  You start spouting some redpill truths that no one wants to hear in a social setting.


But at least you have developed some self-respect and you’d rather lose the girl than act like a doormat. And just like that, you start having some success, albeit limited at first. More important, your eyes are now open and you’re impressed to see how women manipulate and can be manipulated, how superficial they are, how much they fake and lie, etc. The more it works, the more you get pussy, the more you start to hate women for loving the new you more than the old you.


You get average girls with no problem, but your confidence is shattered the minute a true Alpha Chad appears. Suddenly you cease to exist in women’s eyes, he’s so much cooler than you, effortlessly. You feel amogged and you respond by being aggressive against this dude who steals your thunder, and you look like a douche. But as long as Chad isn’t around, you’re doing fine. 


**Lesson learned at this stage:** Be careful what you wished for. You wanted the secret code to have unlimited pussy? Well now that you have it, it doesn’t seem so fun anymore. Understanding nature deprives you of mystery and fantasy.


**Risk**: You start hating what you crave the most. The risk is to not snap out of this, and become a lying sociopath who relishes using and hurting other people. Also, your friends are really not okay with you improving and disturbing the social balance that was set in your group. They make fun of you trying to improve and, if you listen to them, you’ll be back to smoking weed and playing video games at home every night.

 
**


IV.                **You get pussy, he gets pussy, everyone gets pussy!!  And now you’re a social object**


A couple of years after swallowing the pill, if you’ve been dedicated to improving, everything becomes natural. You have risen to the top of your social circles. You have social power now, and you understand that this is the currency women live for. Girls, but also guys, bug you constantly and insist just to spend time with you. You must learn how to say ‘no’, to average girls coming straight at you, to beta friends who guilt you into spending another Friday with them, to family members, colleagues, etc. Your social life is boosted and your social media start to be filled with new events and faces. One good thing is that after hating women and their nature, you learn to appreciate them again, but this time for what they really are: bubbly, beautiful creatures that only live in the present and remind us to enjoy every minute of our lives.


Also, you fuck. A LOT. Constantly. Your n-count rises up by dozens in a few months. At parties, good-looking girls come at you and actually compete with one another for your attention. You have multiple plates, you don’t care about dropping some because there are always new women that you are vetting just for the privilege to become part of the rotation. More scaringly, most of your beta friends’ girlfriends have made a move to fuck you. You have, ultimately, the power. And so, the moral responsibility is now your burden, as well as the task to unbetafy your friends.


**Lesson learned at this stage:** Everybody you know, in your expanding social circle, wants a piece of you. Even if they can’t fuck you, they want to be seen with you, to show you off, just to increase their social value. You start to understand how hot girls, who get a thousand times more attention, become jaded and bitchy. It’s hard to have to reject people constantly while maintaining a good-hearted spirit.


**Risk**: You are now the king of your own little kingdom, you fuck 6s and 7s constantly with no effort, they just come knocking at your door. Your friends -and their girlfriends-  revere you. The risk is to enjoy this too much, be satisfied and stop improving. Soon enough you end up marrying a good looking 6 and get fat while watching football with the same beta friends you had. Still better than your past self, but you could do so much more.. This point is actually where I think a lot of redpillers get stuck. They stop improving the minute all their needs are met.

 
**


V.                  **Pizza is awesome, but in the end it’s just pizza. Let’s look for more important things**


It’s been a few years now, and you’ve grown into a full-blown alpha. You look much better than you ever did. Not only is your physical frame solid, but also knowing the Truth has molded your brain in a different way, and as mind and body align, you start to have a different stare, a different voice that comes from within, a confident demeanor, a calm and solid posture. People say you’ve changed, but they can’t really pinpoint why. This is why: you own 100% of your shit, you’re basically unshameable. If you get wasted at a bar you’ll still hit on the hottest girl, and will get her to come home, and if you go soft the hot girl will actually be turned on by how much you don’t care about losing her. You’ve had threesomes, sex with gorgeous girls 15 years younger, blowjobs from girls you met in an elevator. You don’t lie because you don’t need to lie anymore. You can tell a girl that you just fucked another girl two hours ago in the same sheets, it doesn’t matter, if she leaves there are so many in line. You realize the stories you read on The Red Pill when you were a newbie were all true, as the same crazy things happen to you, and more.


At this point, pussy is in free access. It’s like pizza. You love it, everybody loves pizza, even bad pizza is still pizza. A few years ago you would have eaten pizza every day if you had the chance, but now you realize it’s just a cool thing you can get whenever you want. You start to enjoy other things than women, like finding and dedicating yourself to your mission, the real friends you have, etc.  


**Lesson learned at this stage:** Now when another Alpha enters the room, you’re actually genuinely happy. What you thought was amogging a few years ago, is actually him testing you to see if you’re solid. Now you stand your ground and banter back, and both guys are delighted to meet another real man in an ocean of male and female betas. Also, neither of you cares about who gets the hottest girl because you have so many chicks lined up, and that’s how you know you’re both Chads. And when you end up turning one of your beta friends into an alpha, there is no better feeling than this.


**Risk**: In all your masculine glory, you have applied your skills and efforts to something (getting pussy), and have mastered this art. See how amazing that feels, to be on top of that mountain? But there are way bigger mountains around,  things more worthy of your masculine energy than pussy. Don’t get stuck on such a trivial thing, find your mission and focus on it.",1015,2.0,0.2678000032901764,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck"

Put simply you've been lied to, and odds are you've been subjected to a [Poisoning the Well logical fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/140/Poisoning-the-Well) and a poorly crafted [Straw Man Fallacy](http://www.logicalfallacies.info/ambiguity/straw-man/). 

My personal thinking is that the creators of the CNN report that lead you here are guilty of plain old fashioned [Yellow Journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism). They tried to create a hit piece on us, and the manosphere in general, and have failed spectacularly. Besides, why would CNN care about little old us? What useful purpose could they have for targeting us? We're just a subreddit like the message boards of old. 

The truth is that our message resonates with millions of men and women because we cut the crap and speak plainly about dating, relationships, and the forces at play in our so called ""battle of the sexes"". Sometimes this ruffles  feathers, but our tone doesn't make our message untrue. Notice they always attack the tone and never the message itself. If they did they'd be putting a spotlight on how fraudulent the blue pill really is, and that would threaten the status quo. We can't have none of that, no sir!

1017,3ggyw3,"You may have heard the case of Elizabeth Petrakis, the woman who got her prenup thrown out.

Here is the full story as a reminder: http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/04/n-y-prenup-battle-winner-destroyed-family-with-affair-cousin-says/

This woman meets a successful millionaire who's built his own fortune through his life's own hard work and investments in real estate.

She wants to marry, being a smart guy he naturally is wary that she could be after his money.  She doesn't want to sign a prenup, but he says there is no way they are getting married with out one, so she reluctantly agrees.

Well, come several kids later, she hits the wall and wants a divorce.  She claims the prenup is the reason for their marriage falling apart, even though she never was forced into it. She could have always refused the marriage and refused the prenup.  But those were his conditions and she accepted it.

Well it turns out she was full of shit.  She was cheating on her husband with her cousin's husband.  When her cousin comes out against her with this, she has no option but to admit to it.  But she still insists her affair wasn't the reason for the marriage falling apart, oh no, she still insists it was the pre-nup.

Here's the real kicker:

She tells the judge that her husband had promised her he would get rid of the prenup after they had children.  That's what she says, that he made an oral agreement with her.  She has no proof of this promise or this oral agreement, its just his word against hers.

Well the judge believes her, and throws out the prenup, and now she is entitled to half his money, even after she cheated on him, even after he thought he was safe by signing a prenup.

Remember guys, not even a prenuptial agreement can protect you.  Marriage can and will destroy you, there is absolutely no point.

Be careful in even entering a de facto marriage before you live.  In some countries, being in a LTR with someone where you move in together and live together for some time as de factos can still grant the ex-partner your assets should you break up.

1018,8n6z8h,"I remember getting into a lot of this back in 2008 or so. In those days there was just The Mystery Method, and a handful of other books on the topic. I used the information, and yes I got laid. My success wasn't immense, but it was enough for me.

Chad wasn't even a thing (that I can remember). It was just alpha and beta. The focus was just pickup. I don't think Rollo had even written his book yet (not sure). 

Now there's SJWS, The Purple Pill Debate, Incels (wtf), neo masculinity, and a lot of feminists up in arms about all this stuff. I kind of miss how it was back then. It was just guys talking about how to pick up women, and all the mandatory self improvement that come out of that.

Anyway, here's a little advice from a guy that's been around the block. Hopefully this won't sound too redundant:

1. Incels are just guys that haven't even begun to start trying. They are lost. The people talking about them have some weird agenda. Just ignore them.
2. Women will never ever admit to hypergamy. Don't waste your time. Just be rational and navigate.
3. Exercise is important.
4. Before obsessing about getting laid, ask yourself, do you care that much? Most guys are programmed to think that if they aren't getting laid they are losers or something. You're not a loser.
5. FATE is what I never see talked about much in this community. Some people are fated not to have too many relationships, and not because they are loser omegas or betas. Some people were born more for other things. Maybe they go off to war. Maybe they live in the woods. Maybe they strive before success gives them what they want. This is normal. Enjoy striving. Get a sense of your own fate. It will help.
6. There's nothing wrong with learning better social skills to pickup women. Holding a frame, learning to joke in a conversation etc are all important. The people that think this is bad are lost. Women that get offended even when a man politely flirts with them are BITCHES. They qualify themselves out when they react. Don't forget that. 
7. As you get older you'll be able to tell when a women is into you within a minute of talking to them. This isn't rocket science. Pay attention to subtext. SUBTEXT.
8. Women have to carry a baby for nine months. That's why this all seems like so much work. If you don't like it, strive or get to know your bisexual side.
9. Porn will fuck you up. It's just too advanced now for our ape brains to deal with. Jerk off without it.
10. This isn't a community just for conservatives or liberals. It transcends those boundaries.

And finally one last super important observation. I used to look at all my failures and blame myself. If only I had done X. Or if only I had done Y. What I didn't do was give myself enough credit. Maybe I ran a DLV spike because deep down inside I didn't like her. Maybe my failures weren't failures because I didn't stand up for what I actually needed. QUALIFYING is very important. You can't qualify what's right for you, if you can't stand up for yourself.

Ask yourself if you actually give that much of a shit. Ask yourself what you NEED not what you WANT, and remember getting in touch with your needs can take years!

YOU CAN'T FAIL IF YOU KNOW SHE'S NOT RIGHT FOR YOU. Talk to thirty women... how many are actually a match? Maybe one? Those other twenty nine aren't failures, and yes that applies to just getting laid too. Who the hell wants to fuck someone they aren't actually into? You see? Your needs matter a lot. Don't ignore them. Get to know them.

The End


p.s. No not everyone can master the day game method of picking up a total stranger off the sidewalk. Socially engineer what WORKS FOR YOU. The gym, a club, house parties, workplace, church, NA meetings, dating sites, etc are all valid ways to meet someone.

1019,6l6bpm,"Oh boy, buckle up fellas. Older folks on TRP might remember the original story of the girl who dumped her boyfriend for living frugally only to later find out that he was rich af and simply chose to live that way. As soon as she breaks up with him he goes no contact and gets on with his life and she cannot figure out why. She then finds out he was secretly rich and was *choosing* not to spend money on her and gets even more confused. Part one takes place in 2014.

**Part one - original**

> *TL;DR - My boyfriend kept his wealth a secret from me throughout our entire relationship. I ended the relationship on the pretext that he wasn't money/career motivated, he didn't say anything to the contrary. *

> I [F26] have been dating Will [M27] for most of 2014; I met him on New Years Eve, we exchanged numbers, scheduled a coffee date and have been seeing each other ever since. He's tall and shy, with long thick hair like Eddie Vedder. He lives in an older house by himself and drives a 1997 Toyota. He dresses very casually - I don't think he even owns a collared shirt - and all his clothes are minimum 1-2 years old. For income, he told me he ""ran a few websites"" and picked up piece-work as a 'session guitarist'. He is also very frugal. He never took me out for fancy dinners or anything. In the beginning it was always coffee dates, walks, hikes, etc. If we go out, he insists on 'pre-drinking' and refuses to buy drinks at a bar. Most nights he was content staying in, watching Netflix and playing his guitar.

> I never outright asked how much money he made, but given his lifestyle, clothes, furnishings, etc. plus the fact that he rarely worked, I assumed it wasn't much. I would lightly prod him with questions about the future, if he had any career goals - he would say that he ""saw me in his future"", but also he was ""happy the way things were"".

> I have Facebook and am on it every day, usually when work is slow. Lately my newsfeed has been filled with my peers getting married, buying houses, having babies, and other various accolades. I can't help but feel jealous by this; it seems like everyone but me is making significant gains in their lives and relationships. Three weeks ago, after seeing a girl I knew from high school buy her 3rd property with her husband, it felt like my relationship with Will was juvenile and had no future.

> The next time I was over at Will's (after he served me potato soup for dinner and was torrenting a documentary for us to watch later) I ended the relationship. I was perfectly honest about everything - he was a great guy, I loved him and his personality, but I felt he lacked career/life ambition and we wanted different things for the future. He sat and listened to everything, seemingly unmoved by it. When I finished talking, he said ""fine by me"" and asked me to leave. I went to hug him on my way out, instead he just guided me out the door and slammed it shut behind him.

> With prior boyfriends, we'd still talk or text a bit after we'd be broken up. Sometimes we'd even still hook up. I dunno, I've just never had a 'bad break-up' and always try to remain on good terms. I haven't heard a fucking word from Will, even after texting him multiple times and calling him once.

> I saw two of Wills friends at the gym today. I went over and made small talk, asked how he was, etc. I tried to explain myself, saying he was a great guy but our views on money and the future didn't seem to mesh. To this, one friend chuckled to himself and walked away. I asked the other friend WTF that's about it, and he says ""Yeah, we heard. The thing is, Will's loaded. He inherited his grandpas land which is leased to oil and gas companies. I've seen the quarterly checks he gets and they're more than my yearly salary. Good luck getting him to spend it, though. He has a 'if it aint broke, dont fix it' type mentality. Just look at that piece of shit he drives!""

> This has completely baffled and upset me. I dated him for 10 months when I thought he was penniless, proof I'm not a fucking gold-digger. I am a 26 year old woman who needs to be pragmatic, I can't just indefinitely date someone with the future being so uncertain. He could've said something, ANYTHING during our break up when I was explaining my doubts about our relationship. Instead he said nothing, and now he refuses to talk to me. It makes absolutely no sense.

>I just feel so low right now. If a man with disposable income meets a woman he likes, doesn't he want to treat her? He said he ""saw me in his future"", why didn't he care enough to share these things with me? He could have easily kept our relationship alive by being forthcoming. Someone please help me make sense of this situation.

Her lack of self awareness is astounding! I love how she just cannot seem to figure out why he's not talking to her after she broke up with him, why he told her to leave and didn't want to hug her goodbye after she essentially told him he wasn't good enough for her to stay in a relationship with. She just seems genuinely baffled - him accepting the break up and moving on is now a 'bad break-up'! 

**Part 2 - the update**

And here's where it gets glorious. A year later and she no longer broke up with him because of his frugality but because ""he had been dishonest about some things... [and she] couldn't come to terms with his lying by omission. It seemed he threw [their] relationship away over nothing.""

> In 2014 I went through a pretty bad break-up. I met Will at a NYE party hosted by a friend-of-a-friend and we dated for 10ish months. I loved him - it was probably the best relationship I'd had on a 'personal connection' level - but he had been dishonest about some things (not infidelity - 'life' things) and it led to us breaking up. I couldn't come to terms with his lying by omission - it seemed like he threw away our relationship over nothing.

>I was pretty unhappy for a while, not gonna lie. Went on a few dates, had a few Tinder flings, but nothing serious. Around summer 2015 is when things started to turn around and I felt I was in a good place. Happy with my job, happy with my body, happy with my social circle - just all-around happy and patiently waiting for Mr. Right to come along.

>My friends and I were invited to the same NYE party this year, hosted by the same person. I knew there was a chance my ex would be there, but I didn't care - I was over him. Seeing him and being cordial shouldn't have been a problem. He was pretty icy when the relationship ended, so even if he was there, I didn't expect him to say all that much to me.

>So my girls and I are there early, having a few cocktails and everything is going great... then Will walks through the door. He saw me, smiled, walked directly over and gave me a big hug. With his arms wrapped around me, smelling his cologne... I just melted. In that moment, whatever bad feelings I had about our relationship were completely gone. I just genuinely missed him.

>I got through 15 minutes of small talk with him, my heart racing the entire time. He remembered all these little details about me, my friends and my family - I couldn't believe it. When I told him about my job, my new apartment, etc. he seemed happy for me. When the conversation ended, he gave me another quick hug and then left toward the kitchen.

>My friends could tell that seeing him had affected me. They took me to a more private area of the house to talk it out; they reminded me to not get ahead of myself, he's still the same guy who lied to you, etc.

>When we went to rejoin the party, he was on his phone giving directions to someone. After a minute of eavesdropping it became clear that he was talking to his girlfriend. Fuck.

>I should've left then and there, but I didn't want it to seem like him having a new girlfriend affected me. Like I hadn't gotten on with my fucking life after 14 months apart. And so I stayed.

>She arrived about 10 minutes later and Will introduced her to everyone. She seemed nice enough, but seeing them together made me sick to my stomach. I swear she was being all touchy-feely with him just to spite me. I did my best to avoid them throughout the night. I found out through a friend that they'd been dating for 2 or 3 months. The party ended, I got into a car with my friends and just started sobbing uncontrollably. They tried to comfort me but I was too far gone. They dropped me off and I cried for while longer alone in my apartment.

>This was supposed to be a fun weekend with my girls, we had all sorts of stuff planned, but I ended up staying home by myself last night. No one questioned it, they all knew. I must've wrote 100 different texts to Will last night but didn't end up sending a single one. I'm going to stay in tonight as well.

>I want him back so bad, I just don't know what to do :(

I can't decide if my favourite part is her sobbing uncontrollably or how much of a boss Will is. I'm certain he's on here but if he's not he should be. Wherever you are Will TRP salutes you buddy.

New link because redditlog is kill

It's amazing how, if you read her post, she completely flips the script and blames him for not telling her anything. Even though she left him because he ""lacked career/life ambition"", it's his fault for not revealing his wealth.

Some gems:

>I have Facebook and am on it every day, usually when work is slow. 

Work is slow every day? I wonder what this woman does for a living? Probably HR or some other liberal arts degree related job.

>Lately my newsfeed has been filled with my peers getting married, buying houses, having babies, and other various accolades. I can't help but feel jealous by this; it seems like everyone but me is making significant gains in their lives and relationships. 

*Accolades.* *Gains.* It's almost as if she's viewing this as a videogame and wants the high score.

>Three weeks ago, after seeing a girl I knew from high school buy her 3rd property with her husband, it felt like my relationship with Will was juvenile and had no future.

Oh, the joys of social media. Apparently because all her friends are doing it, she decided she had to do it too! Apparently her boyfriend should be judged against her friends' boyfriends / husbands! Could you imagine how that would go over if it was the other way around. I can imagine some Jizzabel cat lady now:

""But honey, Jack's girlfriend blows him every morning."" HOW DARE THIS SHITLORD COMPARE HER TO ANOTHER WOMAN? WOMAN ARE NOT JUST INTERCHANGABLE SEX OBJECTS...

>after he served me potato soup for dinner and was torrenting a documentary for us to watch later

She says that to make him sound cheap, but if the dude can cook, has money, and knows how to save it instead of throwing it away and living in a perpetual cycle of credit card debt like so many Americans.

>When I finished talking, he said ""fine by me"" and asked me to leave. I went to hug him on my way out, instead he just guided me out the door and slammed it shut behind him.

>I haven't heard a fucking word from Will, even after texting him multiple times and calling him once. 

Dude realizes she's not the one for him, makes a clean break. Respect to him.

>To this, one friend chuckled to himself and walked away. I asked the other friend WTF

Sounds like Will's dealt a few gold diggers in his time.

>If a man with disposable income meets a woman he likes, doesn't he want to treat her?

And that is an example of how widespread BP mentality has become in our world. We are to be seen as nothing more than walking wallets.

Surprisingly, the commentators rip her to shreds.",1020,0.0,0.40459999442100525,"girl, feel, really, find, still, shit, male, always, leave, relationship"
1021,89cqze,"**Define**: *Ingenuine female acts towards a man designed to entice him with pleasure, have him chase her out of fear of losing her, compel him to console and protect her from danger and bad feelz, or have him give into her demands to test his value or garner validation or sympathy.* When fallen for, their egos are inflated, and the tingles are reduced. 

-

Below are examples of each one listed, the motivation behind them, and how to respond. 

-

----------------------
----------------------

-

**1)** HER sending sexually suggestive pictures

* **Example A**: Kid on askTRP received sexy pics from some girl. OP took this as a sign of a guaranteed lay and proceeded to tell her how hot it was and what he wanted to do to her. Girl loses interest. He's left confused.

-

The purpose of the girl sending a naughty pic in the the askTRP kid's situation was to see if he'd drool over her. She was dangling pussy on a stick to see if he'd try to pounce on it immediately. He did, thus demonstrating low value via thirst. **Women want you to escalate while showing sexual restraint**. By not going for the kill, she perceives you as not desperate because you have other options and this is nothing special. Male sexuality is based almost entirely on physique while female sexuality focuses on refusal to give them short-term validation in response to their power grabbing moves and other *abstract* traits that *indirectly* insinuate signs of past sexual success, not your looks or body (especially hot girls).

-

Before the phones became 'smart phones', when they were flip-phones with a pull-out antennae, press buttons, a low resolution camera, and a very primitive email app, if it had apps at all, this would be a different story. When texting was invented, Myspace was in its infancy, Youtube just came out, and Napster and Limewire were cool, a naughty pic would be a sure sign of DTF. But now historical internet porn is common Instagram photos of everyday girls. They post pictures of them dressed and posed in a manner only hookers were known for in the not so far past. **Suggestive pics don't mean shit anymore. That pic she sent wasn't spontaneous out of lust for you, it was one carefully crafted long ago she had saved on her phone and is probably somewhere on the internet already and was sent to several guys in the past**.

-

Men send suggestive pics (i.e. [dick pics](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=krHKxPzl2-A)) in hopes of invoking a woman's arousal enough to want to fuck with low effort. Women send suggestive images to acquire validation and test your value. She has little concern, if at all, for sex, although intrigued. Far from the finish line. 

-

 * **Example B**: Friend of mine matched with a girl on Tinder and began to exchange messages. Tinder girl starts playing games. Friend says bye and unmatches her. Tinder girl later follows him on Snapchat. She sends him a sexy pic. Friend sends one back. She's send another in addition with a ""you gotta earn it"" -like line. Friend laughs and says no thanks. Girl throws a tantrum. 

-

In this case, the girl tried to use her pussy to get my friend to jump through hoops in hopes of sex that was likely never to come to boost her ego. When that didn't work, she went into frame recovery mode. She sent that first pic hoping she would get my friend to do what the askTRP kid in the Example A did, smother her in validation. My friend's response pic wasn't good enough, she wants an overt display to feel a sense of power. So she sends another thinking she can reel him in with the same games she played during the Tinder convo. My friend sees what's up and just ghosts her. If my friend did what the askTRP kid did, she would immediately withdraw and cease contact with him ==> *""teehee, I win. Bye""*. It's all just a game to her. Validation is sex to women. Sex is secondary, often times a 'last resort' way of acquiring the validation they failed to get in the beginning. 

-

edit: **What to Do**: When you recieve one of these pics, give her a small compliment, but nothing more. ""That's hot."", ""bad girl"", anything that suggests slight interest or is sexual. Even tell her you'd like to see her in a specific color or whatever, but don't drool. Keep it short and sweet and wait at least a few minutes before responding to it. The game isn't over yet.

- 

**TL;DR** pics ain't shit. Anything not face to face doesn't matter. [You say yousa freak, you gon' prove it or nah?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUj0otkJEBo)

-

-------------------

-

**2)** HER talking about other guys hitting on her

-

* **Example A**: An ex-girlfriend and I were doing the long distance relationship thing during college. I got a text one evening stating that she had guys ask her out but refused them saying she had a boyfriend. Me: *""Good.""* She then replied with *""I just wanted to you to know that you could trust me.""*

-

Sounds so nice right? She's letting you know you can trust her! If you believe that, you're clueless. **She didn't send this text to alleviate my anxieties, but to INSTILL them in me. It's dread game disguised as noble intention** (plausible deniability), a favorite weapon among ALL women's psychological warchests. Not AWALT, *all women DO that*. She wanted to see me get jealous and worried by blowing up her phone. She wished to see the power she had over me.

-

The best way to respond is ""okay"" or ""I trust you"". That's it. She will likely attempt to instigate drama by bringing it up again and again, attempting to 'reassure you of her loyalty'. Don't fall for it. She may even try to peg the blame on you for not being worried enough. Don't give this a second thought. Drama is for women. **When you wrestle with pigs you both get dirty and the pigs like it**. 

-

I've heard this tactic take many forms like a guy tried to kiss her or touched her butt or men from her sexual past or whatever. Same shit. 

-

 * **Example B**: Same girl told me that she hung with a 'friend' the other day while driving somewhere. Me: ""okay"". Didn't give it any attention. I noticed her looking uncomfortable...... While sitting on her couch later that day, she wanted to confess that it was an ex-boyfriend, but assured me I had nothing to worry about. I ignored it, but the direct acknowledgement of it started to bother me. Come Christmas Eve night, I told her we should 'talk' about it. Long story short, I cried like a faggot with her on her porch bench, telling each other we'll be together forever and trust one another. Christmas Day, family and I were opening presents. My father noticed I was down. I told him what happened. He gave me some tips on how to handle it. Felt better, applied the tips, and it worked in the future. 

-

She told me this instill dread in me. She insisted on telling me because she wanted to be punished for her bad behavior. Women had a deep seated need to observe you setting boundaries. What do you do if a woman decides to do 1-on-1 meetups with ex-boyfriend or other dudes? **Answer**: When a woman indirectly mentions other men, ignore it. When she 'confesses', punish her indirectly by withdrawing attention with no explanation or a bullshit one. Women don't communicate directly. [What to do when your girl wants to hang out with another guy 1-on-1? ==> Demote to plate or dump immediately](http://archive.is/I0G8l)...

-

-------------------

-

**3)** A girl threatening to leave your presence

-

I was at a bar once. At a table near an exit was a trio. A couple and the girl's friend. The conversation between the couple slowly escalated into an argument and the girl began to creep backwards towards the door while talking to the boyfriend. She slung her last insult and announced, ""I'm leaving!"", then stomped out of the building. The boyfriend soon followed her and started calling out to her to resolved the issue. Don't know what happened next, but not relevant.

-

**Patrice O'Neal**: *""What will you do when she takes the pussy hostage and puts a gun to it's head?""*

-

When a girl starts walking away from you, don't chase. When she announces the infamous, *""I'm leaving""*, she's really saying *""I, the beholder of the pussy and my vaginal affections are exiting!""* She's saying, *""Chase me so I feel validated about the power I hold over you!""* That's exactly what it this scenic act was about: ego, power, and validation.

-

If you try to get her not to leave, you fluff her ego and decrease the tingles. Let her stomp off like a child and blow off some steam. It's hard when she's an LTR and you have put in emotional investment, but that's when it matters the most.  Understand that women need these moments of emotional spikes to feel alive. She NEEDS them for her own good. 

-

""Go kick rocks, bitch"" should be your attitude. If she's being ridiculous, be the first to withdraw by telling her to go away if she wants to continue acting the way she is. Big chance she doesn't, because the point of her leaving was to compel you to grovel and have the situation in her [frame](https://archive.fo/QCnET). She can't frame her exit this way if you initiate it. That would be a defeat. Doesn't matter if you were her ride, that's her problem. She can call an Uber or a friend or parent or some beta chump sitting around. Doesn't even matter if she exits the car (bonus points if you stop on the side and kick her out, not accepting pseudo last minute apologies). Don't be like Kelso was with Jackie in [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXRSVvsOg8g). And never initiate contact! Don't keep an eye on her, especially if she starts talking to another guy (she's just doing it to make you jealous and fluff her ego). 

-

I guarantee if you don't chase her or contact her, she'll do one of these things:

 * **A)** Come straight back. You called her bluff.

 * **B)** Say sorry (especially if you told her to leave)

In case A, remain dismissive and show no affection. No apology (especially if didn't do anything wrong you pussy). In case B, if you have deemed this event as a reconcilable offense, make her wait before you respond. Don't discuss the matter in any detail or try to explain your side of the story in an attempt to garner sympathy (she doesn't care about you, she cares about the validation). In either case, you must make her work to return to your good graces, else she won't respect it. 

-

 * **C)** She'll taunt you some more by shifting the blame on you. She'll consider your indifference to her absence as evidence of the 'crime' of not 'caring about the relationship', and attempt to get you to accept liability.

-

This is psy-ops. Don't fall for it. Even if you were somewhat in the wrong, NEVER accept a woman's frame. *EVER*. 

-

>**My Story**: I remember a night with an old girlfriend where she did something to piss me off at the mall. I instantly became cold towards her and we left. Didn't speak to her in the car. She started looking to me for signs of validation in the corner of my eye with puppy dog eyes, a slight frown, and a submissive posture.  Didn't speak to her in the car. I had to get something from the store, didn't speak to her in the store much. We were in separate aisles. By then I had cooled down and we ran into each other in another aisle. I just slowly walked toward her without saying anything and hugged her. Then we walked out the store without me saying anything or showing affection. When we got in the car, she apologized and had some tears. I just put my hand on her leg and said, *""shhhh""*. The conversation eventually turned a little humorous and we kissed. It was the most passionate kiss I ever received from her. She was more kind and affectionate than usual for the next couple days. That was our first 'conflict'. Not exactly as described earlier, but close enough.

-

Make-up sex is often the best sex. At the end of an emotional roller coaster, is wet pussy. The the cycle of drama brings catharsis. This is where *""treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen""* comes from. This is why girls 'stay with' (continue to have sex with) boyfriends that treat them badly. 

-

----------------

-

**4)** A girl threatening or implying the end of the relationship

-
**Read**: [By the time you have 'the talk', she's already packed and planned her exit](https://archive.fo/lKkgP)

-

---------------

-

**5)** Overt communication

-

Women are not like men, they communicate their intentions covertly. When a woman blatantly discusses her intentions or sexual topics, it's a trap or a shit test.

-  She puts up impenetrable LMR. You get frustrated and go cold and do something else. Then she says, ""are you mad because I wouldn't have sex with you?""

-

There are other examples I can't quite put my finger on, but I think you get the idea. Explicitly stating the unspoken dynamic is not what women do. 

-

edit: **What to do**: Ignore and pretend it never happened. ""No it's fine, I'm not gonna pressure into doing anything you don't wanna do."" Play it cool. Just lay down. Some convo. Then say what you need to say to exit or have her leave in a non-butthurt manner. Nothing you can do. Never mention previous ASD. Just sounds butthurt, spirals down a path of no tingles, and activates more ASD. Never remind a woman why she denied sex to you. 

-

------------

-

**6)** Claims she is in some kind of danger

-

**Example**: An ex-gf of mine was at the mall ~40 mins away. She sent a text ""I think these guys are following me"". I then instantly gave her advice on how to handle it and to call me if she needs help. Revenge fantasies flowed through my mind, what I would do to guys who'd try to hurt her. She then instantly said, ""no it's okay. but thanks. It's nothing I can't handle."" 

-

This was pre-meditated. She just wanted her ego boosted by seeing me willing to come to her rescue. There could have been no men at all, she just made it up. The details of her story aren't important, just the outcome. 

-

How to handle it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_ueWyMpLhE (00:40s is the most relevant part)

-

 * There was a post here about this very video and a girl's reaction to it a long time ago. If you could find it, post the link in the comments section. 

-

---------------

-

**7)** Pseudo displays of sexual receptivity (attention whoring)

-

* **Example:** I was at the bar section of a venue. Down by the pool tables were two girls (early 20's). They had this hot-slut look. High boots and uggs. Skinny jeans wrapped around their big posteriors and up on the hips. Mid-section exposed below shirt. Makeup. Earrings. Rings. Necklace. Can't really explain the 'slut look'. They walked towards one particular table. One girl leans back, using the table as support.The other in front of her. They begin grinding on each other aggressively with considerable space from everyone else. They tried to make it look like they were 'just having girl fun, woooohooooo!'. At the end of this erotic display, they returned to the group they came with like nothing happened. They spoke loudly. They flirted with nobody their entire stay, not even the guys with them. 

-

Attention whoring, that's all that was. All they wanted was for men to stare at them. [That validation alone satisfied them](http://archive.is/GspuI). If you were to try to hit on them, you'd fail. They continuously pranced from one side of the bar to the other as a duo. Always quick on the move, flighty, and loud with each other as if trying to have their presence known. At one of their brief stops that just so happen to be in my vicinity, I over heard a conversation with them. One of the sluts was talking about the relief and delight she felt hearing that her baby daddy was going to be released from prison in a few months. Supposedly, he was incarcerated for shooting somebody. 

-

I've only known one guy who can keep these types of girl's attention (the guy mention in 'No. 1, Example B').  He has mastered the art of loud clown game at bars that draws the attention whores to him. He will dress provocatively via peacocking, will ante up the girls high energy, and become the center of attention instead of the hot women, basically the guy version of what the girls were doing, but better than them. He gets off on the whole bar scene, loves it for the sake of it, women or no women. It's his element like a fish in water. It comes off natural. They can only get attention because of their pussy, he gets it because they think he's the fun guy, thus is worth more. These women can't beat an attention competitor, so they try to join him, or rather attach themselves to him. 

-

These women's display of attention seeking acts (dance, loud talk, and walking all over the place) create an illusion of immediate receptiveness. False. This is a chump trap. The barrier to entry is quite high. If you're not Mr. Baby Daddy People Shooter or my friend Mr Clown Game Master, you're not getting any action. Promise.  

-

Don’t be fooled, [you still need game to bang sluts](http://archive.is/jU0Rd)

-------------------

-

**8)** 'Rapport Bombing'

Women are selfish. Women will take a perfectly good conversation and intentionally sabotage it for feelz. If you follow her down this path, you'll get no lady-hole. Anticipate it so you're not caught off guard. Not *""whoa, wtf""*, but *""oh boy, here we go. How can I maneuver around this back to sexy-time?""*

-

 * **Example A**: I was at a college hitting on some milf going back to school. The vibe was happy, conversation was going good until she decided to talk about how her husband passed away... and talked about it for several sentences though I tried to change the subject. It wasn't appropriate based on the topics of discussion. 

-

* **Example B**: Claims to have been raped, abused, or molested in the past (especially when 'unprovoked'). 

-

Real rape and molesting victims usually feel great shame, often times not even sharing it with the family. If that really happened to her, do you think that would come up as a casual part of a conversation with some guy she doesn't know well? Especially in a causal manner? Never. This is some *#MeToo bullshit. All rape allegations should be assumed false until proven otherwise. Women have abused this too much. If she never filed a police report, don't take it seriously. 

-

**What to do**: For both of these examples, always pause for a second. ""Hmmm."" and maybe a ""that sucks"", then gradually change the subject. Never let something emotionally negative from a woman phase you. Often times it's bullshit or is insignificant. But do keep in mind women like to get the feelz running for feelz-sake. It's not a bug, it's a feature. It's a woman thing. No way around that. 

-

 * Side Note: If a girl starts talking about boring shit, remember getting up and walking away without warning is a viable option. Don't let women waste your time. Don't be a [time-ho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9QOQNcpuiA). 

 * Side Note 2: Opie and Anthony w/ Patrice O'Neal (only ones with Patrice), [CultofBlackPhillip](https://www.youtube.com/user/CultOfBlackPhillip/videos) (Patrice O'Neal), [Beige Phillip Show](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheBeigePhillip/videos) (Dante Nero, award winning male stripper)... Just listen to them on youtube. To you newbs, these two are TRP legendary.

---

The new year is almost upon us, and that means online fucking apps (I refuse to call them online dating apps) will be in full force, filled with lonely women who just realized they were alone for the holidays. Blackdragon, the expert on this stuff, [notes that he gets 3x the results in January from apps as any other time of the year](http://www.blackdragonblog.com/2017/10/16/12-months-relate-dating-relationships/).

If you want to take advantage of this, here's what you should do:

**Prerequisites**

Fulfill at least half of the below requirements, roughly in order of importance:

* 5+/10 face (the most important factor; if you are below a 5/10 facially you should move to another country or try daygame)
* 5+/10 body
* White
* 5'9"" or over
* Decent style (e.g. new, well-fitted clothes, hair and facial grooming)
* Under age 35
* Live in a city of more than 150,000 people

If you are lacking in one or more of these factors, improve the controllables (e.g. lift, lose body fat, buy new clothes, get a haircut, move, etc.) and once you're ready, implement the below.

**Photos**

Assemble four to six photos of yourself of the below archetypes. These photos must not be selfies, and ideally should be taken with a DSLR by someone that knows what they're doing.

If you don't have these photos, talk to your photographer friend, or hire a photographer from Craigslist/Instagram. If you don't want to go this route, buy a cheap DSLR and a 50mm 1.8 lens from Craigslist, buy the cheapest tripod you can find on Amazon, buy a DSLR remote, and take the photos yourself.

The first bullet is required, you can pick and choose from the rest:

* Upper-body shot of just you. Ideally taken with a DSLR with you in focus with a blurred, interesting background, wearing nicely-styled clothes (a suit if you're over 25, a button-down or something else nice if you're under 25).
* You with a dog or some other sort of animal. Only do this if you actually like animals.
* You with a group of friends. You should be as tall or taller and as attractive or more attractive than every friend in the photo. All of your friends must be decently attractive and not low-status (i.e. if this photo was taken at an anime convention, you're toast).
* You doing [insert hobby here]. Snowboarding, DJing, skydiving, climbing, playing a high-status sport (sorry, Magic: The Gathering doesn't count).
* You in an exotic location.
* You doing something that indicates you're a leader of men. Holding a microphone, giving a speech, standing on stage, etc.
* A candid, shirtless photo (e.g. playing sports, on a beach). If you cannot bench your bodyweight and/or squat/deadlift 1.75x your bodyweight AND are less than 18% bodyfat, skip this. If you don't have a candid shirtless photo, a non-candid is OK, but you'll get worse results.

Once you have the photos, pick out 10-12 that you think are good and send them to three girls you've hooked up with in the past to get their advice on which to use. Close female friends are a decent secondary options. [Photofeeler ](https://www.photofeeler.com/)is a distant third.

**App Setup and Swiping**

*General App Setup*

1. Create a fake Gmail account.
2. Use the fake Gmail account to create a fake Facebook account with a photo of a male model and your real first and last name (you don't have to use your last name if you're not using Hinge). If you're 28-35 and want to fuck 18-22 year olds, put your age as 27. This has the added advantage of giving you a 50% discount on Tinder Plus, as we'll see later.
3. Go to a random page in the Philippines and add 500 random Filipinos until you have 100 Facebook friends. This is needed to bypass Facebook account verification for Tinder.

*Tinder*

1. Download Tinder and sign up with your fake email address.
2. Tap ""Get Tinder Plus"" and purchase Plus. If you're under 28, this should cost $9.95 a month. If you're 28 or over, this will set you back $19.95 a month.
3. Upload the photos you picked out in the photos section. Leave Smart Photos on.
4. Write a short, positive, non-needy bio that demonstrates higher value, e.g. ""Dog whisperer. World traveler, last three trips were to Bali, Australia, and New Zealand. Avid cook, I guarantee my bacon risotto is better than yours.""
5. Link your Instagram only if you have over 1000 followers and/or you have interesting photos that show a high-value lifestyle (e.g. travel, parties, friends).
6. Go to settings and set your distance range to the furthest range you think a girl would be willing to travel to meet you. [Use the Gmaps Radius tool to figure out what the radius of your surrounding area is](http://obeattie.github.io/gmaps-radius/?lat=-34.622441&lng=-58.423342&z=13&u=mi&r=10).
7. Set your age range to 18 at the low end and whatever the age of the oldest woman you'd have sex with is at the high end.
8. Go to [www.tind3r.com](http://www.tind3r.com) and set up the Chrome extension so you can swipe and message from your computer.
9. Start swiping with Tind3r. Your minimum for a right swipe would be a girl you'd have sex with if they were to come directly to your house with no monetary investment from you. [Do not swipe right on every girl, it brutalizes your private Tinder ""Elo score""](https://www.fastcompany.com/3054871/whats-your-tinder-score-inside-the-apps-internal-ranking-system).
10. Don't read bios or look at closely at photos or Instagrams. You should spend less than a second looking at each profile's photos before determining how to swipe. I can swipe about 75 girls a minute accurately with Tind3r and double that using my phone. This means, assuming 5000 girls are in your area, you should only need to waste about ten minutes a day swiping. 
11. Every day, use your 5 superlikes on girls you think are *just* out of your range. E.g. if you generally fuck 5s and 6s, use superlikes on 6.5s and the odd 7.
12. Swipe only during idle time, i.e. when you're on public transportation or on the toilet.
13. On Sunday between 8 and 10 AM, use your one free monthly Boost, which will put your profile at the top of every girl's stack in your area for 30 minutes. You don't have to swipe during this Boost, it doesn't have any effect on the matches you'll get.

*Bumble*

1. Download Bumble and sign up with your fake email address.
2. Upload the same photos and use the same bio as you did on Tinder. If you linked your Instagram on Tinder, mention it in your bio.
3. Use the same distance and age settings that you did on Tinder.
4. For Bumble, you're going to autoswipe. First, download [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/) on your computer. Edit AutoHotKey.ahk and paste the following in: https://pastebin.com/4XiZHpNd
5. Download [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/), an Android emulator. Run through the setup.
6. Download Bumble on your BlueStacks instance. Log in with your fake email address.
7. In the bottom right, click on the icon of the keyboard and map ""r"" to ""Swipe Up"" and ""g"" to Swipe Right.
8. While on the swipe screen, hit F7. Let the autoswiper run until you run out of profiles to swipe on (you won't be able to use your computer while you do this, so use a different computer or run it overnight).

*Hinge*

1. Download Hinge and sign in with your fake email address.
2. Use the same photos you did with Tinder, but remove any shirtless photos if they're not candid.
3. If you're under 5'10"", add an inch to your height.
4. If you have a medium to high-status job, list it.
5. If you went to college, list it.
6. Answer three of the questions in a witty, intellectual way. Use good grammar and proofread for spelling.
7. Start viewing profiles. Never like any of the photos of the girls, but rather their questions directly (shows interest in their ""mind"" rather than their appearance).
8. Don't waste your time leaving a comment with your like unless you have something interesting to say (e.g. if she says she wants to go to Ecuador on her bucket list, mention that you just got back from there).

*Coffee Meets Bagel*

1. Download Coffee Meets Bagel and sign in with your fake email address.
2. Use the same photos you did with Hinge.
3. Follow the same Hinge guidelines about height, job and education.
4. Use the same questions you answered for Hinge but warp the answers to fit Coffee Meets Bagel's scheme for ""I am..."", ""I like..."" and ""I appreciate when my date...""
5. Go to suggested and like all the Bagels you'd have sex with.
6. Go to discovery and like girls until you run out of beans.
7. Repeat this process every day at noon (when your bagels have been replenished).

*Happn*

1. Download Happn and sign in with your fake email address.
2. Use the same photos and bio you did with Tinder. If you linked your Instagram to Tinder, link it here as well.
3. If you never leave your house, sign out of Happn on your phone and sign into Happn on BlueStacks. Use the BlueStacks location feature to change your location to where hot girls live/work/hang out. Change your location once a day.

**App Messaging**

If you're playing this right, matches should be rolling in on all of your apps. You're going to use the exact same openers and messaging format for every app.

1. Open a girl with a non-needy, *unique *opener (I'm not going to post examples here, because if I do they'll start getting used and not be unique anymore). The opener should ideally assume something about her and end in a question mark, but doesn't have to.
2. Gauge her response, and write back, using less text than her. If she hasn't asked you a question (what I call the *hook point*), provide some information, like a DHV about yourself, and ask her another question.
3. If she's asking you questions back, you have a green light. Respond something like ""That sounds cool, we should grab a drink. I'm free [x] or [y] day, let me know what works for you."" Based on her response, tell her where and when to meet you.
4. If she's not asking you questions back, you have a yellow light. Keep DHVing and teasing her for a few more lines until you get her to invest. If she's not investing but still responding, hit her with the date pitch after a maximum of five messages from each of you.
5. If she's being combative, you have a red light. Stay non-reactive and playful. Keep DHVing and teasing her until you have a yellow or a green light, at which point you should pitch the date.

Other tips:

* Ignore any rules about waiting a certain amount of time to text back. The minute you match with a girl, you are already fighting a losing battle against her attention. Reply back as soon as possible and keep her engaged.
* If a girl stops responding, wait 2-3 days (at *least*) and hit her back with a funny respawn text teasing her for disappearing. I'm not going to post mine, but if she's riding a horse in her profile, here's a mediocre example: "", did you fall off your horse and die? Let me know where I should send flowers."" Do this twice, and wait 2-3 days between each message. If she doesn't respond, leave her and work another girl.
* Burn every lead to the ground. You should be messaging and scheduling dates with *every* girl you match with in order to cultivate abundance.

If you want examples, I recommend the breakdowns on [Playing with Fire](https://www.playingfire.com/category/lay-reports/). He's the only guy I know that provides full screenshots of all his messages from opener to sex (keep in mind, however, that he is above average looks and runs shirtless photo + explicit bio game. If you're average, you can't expect these results, but his messaging is good).

**Weekly Routine**

The above will cover you for the first week. After that, you'll notice that your matches are going to fall off. This is because Tinder and Bumble give newbies an early boost to get their profiles shown to more people. So every Sunday night, here's what you're going to do:

1. Create a *new* fake Gmail account and Facebook event, and add 100 friends again.
2. Go into your Bumble and Tinder accounts associated with your old fake email and hide the profiles to the public. This will make it so you can still chat with your old matches, but won't have two profiles up at once.
3. Create new Bumble and Tinder accounts. Follow the exact same methods as you did last week regarding using your Tinder Boost and autoswiping on Bumble, but tweak your photos/bio using feedback from the last week.

It should take less than an hour to do this each week, but you'll get 50% more matches, not only with the newbie boost, but also because you'll be shown to different girls each week due to the random nature of Tinder.

**Results**

Number of matches per week is going to completely depend on physical attractiveness and quality of profile, as well as your sexual market value in your city compared to the male competition on the apps.

Here are my average weekly results as an average-looking guy in San Francisco, the hardest city in the United States for average guys:

* 52 matches (30 from Tinder, 7 messages from Bumble, 13 from Hinge, 1 from CoffeeMeetsBagel, 1 from Happn)
* 36 matches worth opening (rest were errant swipes or I had buyers remorse)
* 17 matches reply
* 5 matches schedule a date
* 2 matches actually show up to the date (the rest flake or logistics don't work)

Two dates a week is on the low end for cultivating abundance, so if you're getting worse results than this, something is wrong. You need to improve your sexual market value, photos, openers, or messaging.

It's impossible to provide generic troubleshooting steps because every guy will have different problems, but if you post a comment here or PM me on reddit, I'm happy to help.

Finally, you'll notice I didn't provide any information for what to actually do on a date. That's because this has been written about extensively by other guys. I recommend [Blackdragon](http://www.blackdragonblog.com/) or [JMULV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF4WvgHQtcypvg5fPTog-Yg) for more on that.

1023,8vvebj,"I was listening to Episode #1139 of the Joe Rogan Experience with  Jordan Peterson yesterday, and after a discussion on hierarchies and free speech, Jordan Peterson went full Red Pill on releationships, sex, and beta bucks/alfa fucks. The interesting details is that both Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan used language and terminology that we use here! 

I had suspected for a long time that both Joe Rogan and Jordan Peterson have deep knowledge of gender/sexual interactions from a Red Pill view. Red Pill theory convinced me a few months ago, but hearing a Harvard educated psychologist talk about it was refreshing. Kinda makes you wonder how many of these academics have deep insight that they never share due to political corretcness.

Because—if you put this quote into practice—any character trait you wish to possess is within your reach. 

The great psychologist, William James, said, **“If you want a quality, first act as if you already had it.”**

Your self beliefs have a huge effect on your thoughts and actions. However, your actions also have a huge effect on your self beliefs.

Therefore—by drastically changing our actions—you can drastically change your beliefs.

***[WATCH THIS](https://youtu.be/bsXmgYECfC4)***

**“The greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can change the outer aspects of their lives, by changing the inner attitudes of their minds.”** - William James

That is to say—to be confident—you must start acting and thinking like a confident person.

To be productive, you must start acting and thinking like a go-getter. 

When your actions and thoughts align with how you want to see yourself, you will begin to believe you are that person. Your subconscious mind will automatically assume that since you are behaving a certain way, you must be that type of person.

**""As a single footstep will not make a path on the earth, so a single thought will not make a pathway in the mind. To make a deep physical path, we walk again and again. To make a deep mental path, we must think over and over the kind of thoughts we wish to dominate our lives.""** - Henry David Thoreau 

With repetition, as Aristotle suggests, you can live at your highest standard and begin to produce excellent results.

>> Not at all. My wife took our baby when she dyed her hair blue and fell in with a crowd of regs feminists that work with her at Starbucks. She moved back in with her mom, stopped working, and hit me up for child support. They set my CS at the highest earnings I've ever made in my life - a single month during my time owning a janitorial business - , pre tax, 40%. So, that one single month (I had got a contract to clean up a demolished building that paid $4000), I made $6000. Luckily, in Texas, there's a cap at a little over $1000 a month. Problem is, I make $600 every two weeks.

>> I didn't cheat. I didn't flake. I was supportive, loving, and if I might say so, a good husband. She cheated on me while pregnant with our child, took off while I was at work, no notice, and filed a restraining order which I later found out all lawyers MUST advise their clients of, because it means a MUCH higher rate of achieving custody. That shows up on my background check.

>> I'm genuinely going to kill myself soon, because I have about two months of savings left with which I can pay my CS, and after that, for each payment missed, it's a court date, with a 180 day jail sentence. Why did all of this happen? So she could find herself. Because she's a strong independent waman who don't need no man. <--- that sentence would have never, ever come out of me before she left.

>> That's not the half of it, either. I won't bore you with details, but just a few highlights are:

>> Legal Aid place said their free help for poor people was ""more for women"".

>> The state provides free attorneys for women but not men in custody and CS cases.

>> 95% of all custody cases are awarded to women in my state.

>> This one's the worst of them all, to me: After all of this, I am, in most of society's eyes, a deadbeat dad.

>> No, this one's the worst: They arbitrated CS from out of state for my wife, so she didn't even have to show up to the court date, but they won't do that for custody. I still haven't even seen my daughter. I learned her name (went from a classic ""Julia"" to ""Aaliahya""..) when the policewoman served me CS papers and treated me like I was trash.

>> My wife, unemployed, living with mom, gets nothing but help and positivity and support. I'm a monster.

>> So, that's the story of how I die, apparently.

>> EDIT: wwell fuck I'm sitting here crying for the first time in.. I don't know.. I can't begin to tell you guys all how much this means to me. I've been living with this huge knot in my chest for close to 2 years and haven't told a soul because I was sure they'd call me weak or not a man or whatever I thought. Just thank you. Thank you thank you thank you, all of you, so much. I promise this to each and every one of you guys: I will document this all. I will make a video detailing all of this, and I'll try to get in contact with some of the people which some of you guys have told me would be interested in the story. I'll plea my case in court before I commit to anything, and like one guy said, maybe jail isn't that bad.

(I think the newspaper is protecting its article against search-enginges so google refuses to translate it for me, translate it manually if you're really interested)

**Summary:** So youth-part of the Liberals suggests men should have the same option to opt out of a pregnancy as a woman

**Body:** The idea is that men should be able to reject parenthood up untill the 18th week (for as long as women can have an abortion without special circumstances). 

Note that this is most likely mostly to get attention as the same party suggested that necrophilia and incest should be legalized a few weeks back. Still the motion put the ""equality"" principle to a test and shines some light on the fact that men have next to no power when it comes to deciding if they want to become a parent or not (wrap it up boys and dont let anyone close to your condoms).

He also points out that this would obviously be an irreversible decision, so you wouldnt be able to change your mind once your kid is successful.

To me this is a very sound and logical idea and the fact that it plays into the ""gender-equality"" ideal makes it even harder for feminist to try to denounce it. Im obviously not naive enough to believe they wont try.

So what's your opinion, do you believe it could work?

1028,7vz5y8,"""Frame is everything. Always be aware of the subconscious balance of whose frame in which you are operating. Always control the Frame, but resist giving the impression that you are."" - Rollo Tomassi, Iron Rule #1

Frame can't really be faked. And if you do fake it, it won't take long before women will poke holes in it. That's what they are meant to do.

Luckily, frame is directly related to your own personal value and belief system. So it doesn't actually take that much to alter. Even a low SMV man with a strong frame *can* work like magic on women (think of convicts and junkie musicians)

Here are the most important points to internalize and actually change your attitude to believe. If you truly make these points real in your mind, gaming will get easy for you.

1. You're better than her. (In every way except maybe taking care of a child)

2. She's there for YOUR entertainment. (Treat her like a servant and ask her to do favors for you)

3. She stopped maturing at 18. (Treat/tease her like a child.)

4. She's a nasty dirty cumguzzling whore for **the right guy.** ALL girls are very sexual. (Don't fear sexual implication, you're a man, it's natural and masculine)

5. You're more willing to walk away than her. Women need to feel that you do not need them. (Outcome Independence. This one is key. DO NOT be more invested than her.)

6. There's NOTHING that she can do to make you emotional and reactive. (Women should be literally incapable of getting under your skin. Nothing phases you. You've seen it all before and it's laughable when they try their mindfuck games)

7. Its her loss if you're hard rejected. You were simply trying to share some of your awesomeness with the world instead of being a selfish asshole and hogging it all to yourself. (Never forget that when you approach, you're OFFERING value to a girl, not LEECHING it. You're doing them a favor.)

8. Recognize knowledge of improvement. (No matter what happens, you're improving your approach and results in the future. Always. There's no such thing as going backwards in skill on approaches)

9. Failure is fun and embrace it (you should approach 9's and 10's to get shut down and learn the difference of their tests to get better).

10. You take/work for what you want. (See hot girl. Want to put dick in. Take steps to see if that's an option to get the desired result you want)

11. Walk and act like you have two french 10's that lick caviar off your balls as soon as you walk through the door every fucking day. (Ignore her beauty, you're used to smokeshows already. They're just girls..)

12. Sex is on your mind and your actions reflect it. (You should be undressing her with your eyes, spanking her/grabbing her ass every chance you get, escalating often, and whispering dirty things you want to do to her in her ear, grabbing her thigh when you're driving, etc. Be the fun sex guy. Leave ""Billy Beta"" in the fucking past)

13. You're the leader. (She follows you. YOU make the decisions, you call the shots, you design the plans. She's just along for the ride.)

14. Her moral recklessness and emotional rollercoaster riding is adorable to you. You've read briffault's law and you know WHAT they are, (not necessarily WHO they are.) You enjoy their fragility and savageness in the same breath.

15. Confidence and boldness is your default. (Walk like Brad Pitt, talk like George Cloony, fuck like Tyler Durden, and lift like Dwayne Johnson)

According to documents sent to the Times via encrypted email, Ms. Argento, who is divorced and has two children, was both a mentor and a mother figure to Mr. Bennett, and the two were intermittently in contact as he grew up. “Jimmy’s impression of this situation was that a mother-son relationship had blossomed from their experience on set together”

A short story over business to business relations. If you are an entrepreneur or working towards being self employed, you need to read this post.

_______________________________________________

#Body

Let's say I had two friends, Tim and Kevin that both started separate businesses. Kevin goes and finds a single customer that will generate $1,000,000 in sales for the year. Tim goes out and find 20 customers, but each customer only generates about $50,000 dollars a year in sales.

Well let’s say I was Kevin's one customer.

 I call Kevin up and say, *”Sup bro, I got an order for you, i’ll send in the Purchase order for $100,000.”* Kevin’s ecstatic, holy shit he’s never seen so much money before in his life. He just started this business and is so excited that he landed such a lucrative contract. He spent the last 4 years going through college to get his business degree, he got married to a lovely girl, they had a kid so she decides to be a stay at home mom at least till he’s old enough for school. He’s been slaving away in corporate America for the past 8 years to pay for college and save up enough to finally start his own business. He’s got this shit on lock. He’s got the work ethic to make this deal happen and he’s going to crush it.

He takes out a mortgage on his home to front the startup loan from the bank. He heads out and buys all the materials needed to complete the job. It end up costing him $60,000 grand to complete the job, 40k isn’t a bad profile margin. From the moment he buys his material from his vendors, he has 30 days to pay them back. That’s the default pay period when business to business transaction happen, usually called Net 30.

Kevin thinks he might be able to get a bit more money out of the work though. He contacts me and tells me he underestimated the quote and it’s going to be an extra 30k to complete. Kevin assumes I’ll understand as this is his first time and I’ve been mentoring him through his whole upstart.  I let him know that’s fine and we renew the purchase order for $130,000.

Now he’s going to make 70k profit! He doesn’t waste any time. From day 1 of him picking up materials he is off putting in the time, labor, sweat and tears to get this done. He’s going to make a killing. 

Kevin and I meet at a trade show last year through mutual interest and I saw the passion in his eyes to get shit done. I knew he had the hustle, he just need a push in the right direction and some incentive to get started. In this case, $1 million in sales a year is what I offered him.

Let's talk about me a little. I’m in my 50’s, been the president of a division of a billion dollar a year corporation for about 10 years now. Our division alone put out $230 million a year in sales. Our parent company that owns us reaches 1.6 billion a year. Kevin’s 1 million dollar account doesn’t even merit a second glance in the accounting office.

Back to Kevin. He finishes up his work. Spent all his material and the job is done. At 25 days since his first material purchase, he still has just under a week to pay back his vendor at the Net 30. Not to worry, vendors know the game, sometimes it takes a bit to get the money before the last tier supplier get’s his check. He learned all this in business school.

He calls up the main office and gives my secratary the news. *”Great Mr Redwood is on vacation in the rockies for the week! When he gets back I’ll have him check out the work and you’ll be seeing the check in the mail within a few business days.”* Kevin’s ecstatic, his first big deal. He’s about to bank 70k profit in a month.

Week goes by and nothing. He calls but doesn’t reach me. The secretary tells him that I’ll be back by tomorrow to inspect the work first hand. Great, he’s had to dig into his savings a bit to pacify the vendor till the check comes in. No worries though, Kevin and I became good friends during this last year and he still has money back in the bank.

Two weeks go by and nothing, He can’t reach me as i never gave him my private cell. He calls the main office, secretary tells him that I checked it out, work was awesome and the check is in the mail. Great, he had to spend some more savings on some emergency medical issue with his kid but now he’s about to bank 70k. He’s dreaming about what this job will be like at the end of the year. The vacation he’s going to be able to treat his family too. Hell, imagine what this will be like in 2 or 3 years. Kevin is literally on cloud 9. The past 8 years has brought him to this moment.

3 weeks, nothing. He’s starting to worry. He’s out almost 60 days and his vendor is starting to send notices. He calls but nothing.

4 weeks past Net 30. same run around.

5 weeks out. still no check.

6 weeks, same.

7 weeks, same.

8, same.

9 weeks. Kevin files for bankruptcy. His vendors take him to court for the money he owes. All his assets, house, everything, seized by the banks. His wife can’t stand him. How could she marry such a loser. How could this have happened? Hell, this is illegal right?

It is absolutely, one hundred percent, positively illegal to do what i just did to Kevin. But good luck trying to take my $230 million dollar a year company to court while you are in the middle of filing for bankruptcy and have no other income source, Kevin. 

__________________________________________________________________

If you think this story is bullshit or this would never happen in modern day America, I can be assured that you’ve never ran a business longer than a few years. Or, you at least have the privilege of not working in my line of work. I’m 25, I’ve been doing what i do for 10 years, I’ve seen it happen twice. My father has seen it happen more time than he can count and so have many others that I have been mentored by. 

My father sat me down one day after he got a call from a company and he said, *""Clint, one day you are going to get a call from a customer or new company. They are going to offer you more money than you've ever seen before in your life. It will be like holding a winning lottery ticket in your hand. All the shit you can do with that amount of money will flash before you. It might be equal to or even dwarf our entire sales for the year. Everything in you will tell you to take that deal.*

*Don't ever take that deal.""*

A large corporation with tons of power goes out and finds some chump that’s eager and driven, they offer him a deal he can’t refuse, only to burn him, not pay, and there is shit he can do about it. They hold such an immense amount of power and influence over you that you can not possibly take them to court. They will drown you in legal bullshit and it will cost you more than you can imagine. 

Now, that 100k, that’s nothing. That’s like a week of sales for most small business. As in 5-50 employee sized businesses. I use 100k because to most ordinary people, that’s a lot of money. Oh, and that extra 30k Kevin thought he was getting out of me. Ha, whatever Kevin wants to hear is what Kevin will hear. I’m Kevin’s #1 sycophant, I’m the *”Yes”* man. 

In business, the more charming and the more enthusiastic a person is, the more you should be skeptical of them. It’s sometimes hard to identify a con man vs just some guy that’s really passionate/charismatic, that takes time and experience. But a good businessman weighs his options and never makes split decisions. A con man will tell you everything you want to hear without a second thought. If you want to know if you are getting conned, present them a serious issue that needs to be discussed, in this case a 30k quoting mistake. if it’s answered in a minute or less, you’ve got problems. 

Conmen talk from an emotionally drive narrative not logic. They will play off your vibes and how you react, not through logic or planned out thoughts. They will have a basic plan for the con, as in me offering a million for enticing Kevin. But their delivery is always rooted in emotional manipulation and getting you to shut down your logical thought process. If you feel emotion, happiness, sadness, anything when making a business deal. Stop, don't make a decision, calm yourself, leave if need be, hell take a week off if you have to. You must be grounded and level when you make giant decisions. Meditate if need be.

The company I saw get burned, they bought 1 million dollars in equipment and material to get a job from a very, VERY reputable corporation. You are probably imagining some slimball president of some shady corporation that could be morally and ethically relatable to Skynet if it was ran by Saul Goodman from Breaking Bad. 

You’d be dead wrong. 

This company that burnt them was a company every single one of you knows of. Hell, half of you probably own an appliance by them. I’ll just repeat that again though if it didn’t set in though. They spent $1,000,000 and didn’t get a dime, filed for bankruptcy a few months later. By a company that pretty much all of you know and trust to make good products.

Oh, and that company that got burnt for 1 million? Ya, that wasn’t some dude like Kevin. That was a company that was in business since the 80’s.


*“So what went wrong? Fuck, this is hella illegal!”* Doesn’t matter what is legal or illegal, it’s what you can get away with. You think laws stop people from doing things? Fuck no, we break laws all the time, the only thing that stops people fucking one another over is if they can get away with it or not.

Bullpill advice would be, take them to court, try to get your money out of them. It will be alright. We believe in you and we are here for you.*(random people on the internet that he probably tried to consolidate with or advice some friend gave him)*.

I’ll tell you right now that advice is worth less than the air and calories it took to say it. here’s the redpill advice. Kevin, you fucked up. You let your emotions and the alluring of dollar signs sway your decision making skills. You saw $1,000,000 written out and said, *”Holy shit, One million dollars, sign me up.”* You let emotion, lust and greed trump logic and planning. You saw a big shinny number, from a company you know and love, that everyone knows and loves, that’s been around forever and you took that as merit for them to be a trustworthy client. Instead of sitting down and looking ahead of what they could do to you if you accept their deal. You thought you were playing blackjack when they were playing chess. You made one move and thought you won the game and didn’t think anything past that. You broke the #1 golden rule of business.

#Never have all your eggs in one basket

Let's take a look back at Tim. I bet you forgot about Tim. In the amount of time Kevin went from 25k in the bank and owning a home to being homeless, Tim cleared 5 orders of 20k each, cost him 15k in materials each, resulting in 25k profit and 100K sales for the month. Good job Tim.

Why? because none of Tim’s customers have power over him. If I tried to pull the shit that I pulled on Kevin, Tim can fall back onto his other accounts to support his business and life style, and have the money to take me to court in the process. 

Tim, can’t be fucked with, because Tim has abundance.

#Lessons learned

This is just one rule of business that I’ve learned through the years being mentored by some truly alpha men. I never correlated it with abundance mentality till TRP though. But it is the #1 rule of business and it’s one they constantly drill into my head. The shit these men have shared with me and taught me is invaluable and stuff you can’t find in textbooks. It’s only learned through experience. Textbooks will teach you what to do if everyone plays by the rules. It won’t teach you a damn thing when it comes to playing the game with people that break the rules.

There is a lot of benefits to the golden rule than foreseeing getting fucked over. For instance it’s not always some dickbag trying to fuck you. Maybe one of your customers goes out of business just due to the economy. Trust me, they won’t tell you they are going under, a lot of times you won’t even know, their purchase orders will just stop coming in or they just go radio silent. If they were 25% of your business, you’ve got problems. You may not go under but you will be laying employees off or taking a pay cut yourself.

At our company we tried to make sure none of our customers gets above 10% of our sales for the year. 5-7% is the sweet zone. If you can manage that, no customer can fuck with you. you should track these number religiously, because trust me, your customers know how much money they pay you a year. And they will use that number to throw their weight around. If you don’t know your % then you don’t know what kind of negotiating power you have. Basic Sun Tzu teachings, *”Know yourself and know your enemy.”*

If rule # 1 is never have all your eggs in one basket, then #2 is never let your customer know how many baskets you have or how big their basket is*(also a Sun Tzu teaching)*. Customers will straight up ask you sometimes, *”How much of our work is your business.”* If they are above 10%, your answer to that question is always, *”I have no idea off the top of my head, I’d have to speak with my accountant on that.”*. They can’t use what they don’t know against you. If it’s below 10%, you tell them exactly what their % is so they know they can’t fuck with you. 

Basic misdirection and power play.

If a customer is over 25% of your business, you should be sweating bullets every day, you should be losing sleep and pulling your fucking hair out. You should not be eating till you secure another account and drop that 25% to 10%. At my company we have dynamic employees, we don’t have dedicated sales reps as sometimes sales are not what we need. When customers hit 15-20%, sales reps head out the door looking for new work or we contact current customers for more work to level the playing field. Growing horizontally is always better than vertically. This is also why consumer goods are great to get into, then you literally have thousands of customers that don’t even equate to 0.1% of your sales. No one owns you and no one can bully you.

If a customer knows they are 35%+ of your work, I don't give a shit who's name is on the sign out front. I don't care who or how many people own shares of your company. If a company is 35%+ of your total work, they now own your business. They just may or may not know it yet. This the most important thing I can ever teach you about business. You become a slave to your customer the moment you are not in a position of Fuck You.

[Here's the thread](http://archive.is/Fdi6w).

Characters in the story: the hamster (32F), her ex-husband (33M) and his new girlfriend (26F).


Husband focused on career, while wife stayed at home caring for his son. She had no hobbies nor friends, was overweight and became less attractive as she hit the wall, and being home alone, she was feeling lonely (probably cheated on her husband occasionally) while husband was working his ass off to provide for family.

The husband stayed faithful, yet to her that wasn't perfect, she wanted him to leave his job(?) to spend more time with her, yet had the husband did so, she'd have left him after a while because he'd no longer be providing her and their kid with quality life, and would have turned into a loser just like she is.

Instead of appreciating the quality life and supporting husband in his career, she gave him drama and **initiated** the divorce.

Hooked the husband on child support (she wouldn't mention facts like this, because that's not good for her self-image) was banging random dudes she'd have found online (very easy for a woman to get laid and get that instant gratification from attention/sex), then after realizing she lost a man with very high SMV, and there are slim chances of getting another one now, she regretted her decision and wants him back.


But unfortunately for her, the husband moved on, found himself a pretty, fit 26 y/o girl with a positive attitude.

Had the husband became miserable and turned into a loser alcoholic, she wouldn't have wanted him back, and rationalized her decision to divorce him as ""right"".

Remember, women will rationalize whatever they want so long as it benefits them.

In this case, she became the victim of her own stupidity. If you're at a point in life, when your SO gives you shit/or your wife divorces you, with little care to your ""feelings"". Just remember, that the best revenge is to get more successful than you currently are, get higher SMV, nothing grinds hamster wheels harder than seeing the man they dumped becoming a better person in the future.

It’s Saturday night, we’re celebrating a friends birthday party, I’m with my boys, older brother and his friends having a great time by the bar, holding court and trading war stories. 

Then:

“ Fuck!! these fat bitches! The nerve! Why is she looking at me.“... 


“ Is she really trying to get with me? who does she think I am?” 

Proclaimed one of my brothers friends, A red pill man by many standards, 28YO in shape, working in finance with a six figure salary and a small real estate portfolio on the side. 

As we looked over to the source of his contempt, we observed a scene primarily reserved for the National Geographic. A herd of what couldn’t only be described as post wall or on the verge of it, very slutty dressed hippopotamuses.

After a few minutes of furious laughter at his frustration and her attempts to open my friend. it settled in on me. This expression, as comedic as it was, actually had a lot of symbolism to it - other than the fact that fat women are not attracted to fat men - ironically 

If as a human being, I cannot even do the bare minimum to take care of my body, why should anyone be attracted to me ? what have I done to attract that beautiful girl who works out everyday and plans her meals ? 

See, he was frustrated because he has worked hard to improve himself, to shape himself into the masculine man and being approached by a woman who could not even control what she put into her mouth, thinking that she was worthy of him, was taken as an insult. 

As women are insulted by the advances of beta males, so are men ( * who know what they deserve ) by fat women 

Society has taught us to “ accept people as they are” and to be “ just be yourself “. This as I have come to learn from this community, is self destructive at best. 

Lesson: Work hard and know what you deserve, and if anyone offers you less, don’t be afraid to tell them to fuck off ",1033,4.0,0.4334999918937683,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
1034,3axfye,"**TL;DR:** Some people can never get enough.

I spent a wonderful three day weekend with my girlfriend of five months.  We've been monogamous since March.  I'm in my early 40s, divorced dad.  She is a 33 year old career girl, no kids, never married. We're both attractive, physically fit, and have very high sex drives.  

We spent most the weekend at my place.  We had sex three times on Friday, four on Saturday, and twice more on Sunday. She orgasms quickly and repeatedly.  She comes so often that one orgasm will blur into the next.  Impossible to count how many times I got her off.

The weather was perfect. In between lovemaking, we ate great meals, watched some Netflix, spent our afternoons laying by the pool, and nights soaking in the hot tub.  It was an amazingly relaxing weekend that we both needed.  She had a great time.  Sunday evening, she snuggled up close.  ""This weekend has been so perfect, I don't want it to end!""  But we both had to work in the morning, so eventually she had to head home.

All day Monday, she sent me text after text.  Sweet and sexual.  Very flirtatious.  ""When will I see you again?""  I replied that I had to get caught up on stuff, but I might be able to stop by for a short visit tomorrow after work.  ""Perfect! I need more of you!""

I spent Monday night doing housework and other chores.  I had an empty fridge, dirty dishes and laundry from the weekend.  She texted me steadily throughout the night.  Same all day Tuesday. ""I can't wait to see you!"" 

I left the office and arrived at her house right as she was pulling in the drive.  She walked over and greeted me with a passionate kiss on the sidewalk.  We went inside.

We talked for a few minutes and I fixed us a couple drinks. She excused herself to use the restroom.  I needed to pee too.  Rather than wait for her, I chose to use the toilet in the master bath upstairs.  I carried the drinks to her bedroom.  I had limited time, and we'd be heading there soon anyway.  I walk by her bed and immediately notice a dried cum stain in the center of the sheets.

What the fuck?

I haven't been here in a week.

Holy shit.

I go take a piss. Thoughts are racing through my head.  What should I do?  Should I call her out?  Demand an explanation? Or just quietly leave? One thing is certain: I'm done with her.  She cheated.  It is over.

When I come out, she's pulling the sheets off the bed.  Very nonchalantly, she says, ""The cat was on the bed, let me change the sheets.  She's shedding like crazy.""

Equally emotionless, I comment that with the warmer weather, she needs to brush the cat more often.  I help her put on the new sheets, and we immediately start having sex.  Afterwards she snuggles up to me.

She purrs in my ear.  ""You've been fucking me so much, I've been raw for days.""  She claims she has been unable to focus at work, thinking of me so often.

I give her a squeeze, then remind her I need to take off.  We dress and she walks me out.  One last kiss in the door and I drive away.

She texts me later that night.  I do not reply.

The next day, she texts me: ""Good morning, sexy!""  A few more texts follow, roughly one per hour.  I don't answer any of them.  Around lunchtime she asks, ""Is everything OK?""  I tell her we'll talk after work.

I call her up.  She asks if I'm upset.  I calmly respond, ""Of course.  You slept with some other guy.""  She denies it.  I tell her I saw the sheet.  She goes quiet, then tries to claim it was me, from the previous week.  I tell her to stop lying.

I maintained an emotionless and calm tone throughout the entire conversation.  I'll spare you the drawn out trickle truth.  It took 10 minutes to get the full story.  There wasn't much to it:

After our long weekend of sex, while texting me all day and night Monday, she had also messaged a friend to buy $20 worth of weed.  They smoked a bowl and had sex.  The end.

I've met this guy.  Hell, I've bought weed from him too.  He's the stereotypical loser pothead.  Nice enough guy, but he's pudgy, and has no ambition. An out of shape nobody with a dead-end job.  But she was horny and he was there.  Her pussy was raw and swollen.  She wanted dick. He had dick.

""I don't even like him!"" she protested.  ""It didn't mean anything.  I wanted you, but you weren't there!""

I told her we were done.  She was a free woman and could do what she liked, but I wasn't going to see her again.  She cried and begged forgiveness.  I calmly said good night and hung up.

She called me back, I didn't answer.  She texted me, begging to talk.  I blocked her number.  Removed her from Facebook.  Deleted her from my phone.  Two days later, a mutual friend (more hers than mine) asked what happened.  I simply told her we parted amicably.  We had moved on.

It's been two weeks now with no further contact.  There's very little overlap in our social circles.  We're both career-minded professionals.  I don't expect any stupidity.

Some of you may be wondering why I chose to fuck her that final time.  Mere minutes after removing the cum stained sheet from a bed where she had fucked some other guy maybe 20 hours prior. Why didn't I lose my shit and call her a whore? Don't I have any masculine pride? Sure.  But I just didn't care.  In the time it took me to take a piss, I had already written her off.  This was one final bang with an ex.  She just didn't know she was my ""ex"" yet.

**Lessons learned:** Nothing I didn't already know.  Pure TRP fundamentals.

Good sex is not enough to make a woman faithful.  They have free and unlimited access to dick.  If she wants it, she can get it. She was horny for me, but I wasn't there.  

I gave her commitment and emotional validation as well.  It still wasn't enough.  She's an older woman (33) with many past sexual partners.  While she may have loved the way I made her feel, sexually and emotionally, both have far less value with experienced woman.  The more partners a woman has had, the weaker the pair bonding.  Even my best was not enough to maintain her loyalty.

Did you notice the unspoken implication? It was my fault she cheated.  She wanted me, but I wasn't there.  Clearly, I screwed up by not being available to bang her a fourth day in a row... ;)  It is never their fault.

When you break up with a girl, do it calmly and without emotion.  Don't make a scene. Don't give her drama as a parting gift.  They crave that emotional climax. A big finale. Don't sacrifice your frame/dignity just so she can have her closure.

Know what you want.  I was not in love.  I was never looking for a LTR.  I don't have time to spin plates, so I prefer short-term relationships.  All I ever wanted was 6 months of companionship and good sex.  I'm not going to cry because I only got 5. She was my spring fling, nothing more. Spring is over and she is gone.  Time to find her replacement.

Some women hit the Wall softly. Even at 33, she's still fit and attractive.  She'll find another guy.  Probably quicker than I'll find the next girl.  Doesn't matter, it isn't a competition.  Maybe she'll land a BB husband.  Or maybe she'll end up alone with her cat.  I don't care either way.  This is the way of the world.  No point getting upset.  It is what it is.",1034,0.0,0.30799999833106995,"girl, feel, really, find, still, shit, male, always, leave, relationship"
1035,6yt1ak,"**This post is in response to another community member's post that essentially amounts to fear mongering over the use of plastics. The fact that almost no one in the comments, including multiple ECs, questioned the validity of the linked literature is worrying, and illustrates the need for a quick run-down of scientific skepticism.**

First off, let me say that bringing up topics like estrogen-mimicking plasticizers is completely valid and important. However, stating that ""plastics are the tobacco of the 21st century"" without a wealth of credible primary literature is absurd and akin to stating that ""water is a chemical in weed-killer so it must be bad for you"". 

**Why you should trust my judgement:** I am a molecular biologist and immunologist who is active in the academic sphere and have expertise in *in vitro* cellular assays. This is a fancy way of saying that I grow lots of cells in plastic dishes and then look at them in different ways, and it's how most of these studies are conducted. Also, it's my job to evaluate academic literature.

**Ok let's do this I'll try to make it as entertaining as possible.**

____________________________________________________________________
**Polymer Chemistry - also known as REEEEEEEEEEEEE**

As mentioned in the original article, some specific types of plastic polymer are embedded with *plasticizers* - essentially molecules added to the polymer matrix to change the physical properties of the material. Now most plastics are really just long carbon chains arranged horizontally with some interlinking vertical bonds, kind of like a the lines on a sheet of paper. Plasticizers insert themselves in the spaces between the lines and push them apart, making the material more flexible. 

Knowing that there are many types of plastic and many ways of making each type you might ask - ""well what kind of plastics should I watch out for? Am I really being dosed by 'big tampon' with endocrine disruptors until I get a period so they can make even more money?"" Well big tampon may be trying, but substances recognized as harmful by the primary literature are really only commonly found in the following materials:

1. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
2. Nitrile (like the rubber gloves your doctor wears for your weekly prostate exam)
3. Polyesters (this is more of a class of plastics)

Now keep in mind that polymer chemistry is really a black magic in itself and nothing is as simple as, ""yes this water bottle will give you bitch tits"" or ""no this prostate stimulator will not - unless you stick it in your mouth"". So instead of going through a list of plastics, of which there are many, and their production methods let's just get to refuting the literature linked in the OP. If you're *dying* to talk physical chem you can contact me and we can both pretend like we know what's going on after reading wikipedia.

**Das Swedish Study**
-
The first claim the article makes is that a Swedish study (n=200) found a correlation between maternal phthalate levels and ""anogenital distance"" - that's the distance from the anus to the genitals (commonly referred to as the scrote or undercarriage) after 20 months of life. 

First of all, you have to go on a wild goose chase to even understand why anogenital distance was used. It's actually a method of measuring reproductive toxicity as the trait is under androgen-receptor control. *However*, this method is really only used in animal studies and is not commonly applied to humans. Secondly, looking at Table 5 as presented in the study, the researchers present a model of confidence intervals that are not even close to significant. Not only that, but the article provides no evidence that (1) the pthalates in the maternal urine samples measured were from incidental ingestion of plasticizers or that (2) the correlation between maternal pthalate levels and scrote length has anything to do with the correlation between you drinking water out of a microwaved bottle and your dick shrinking up into an infinitesimally dense and small point, birthing a black hole. 

**This study is completely irrelevant to the original posters point.**

**Study #2: The Mysterious Case of Shitty Workers' Rights in China**
-

Luckily I didn't even have to waste my time reading deciphering jargon and ugly figures this time around because this isn't even a research paper. It's a huffington post article **that literally says half way down the page, ""This data should not raise alarm bells for men who don’t work in chemical factories"".**

The study the article sites was looking at levels of free testosterone in men who worked in a plastic factory in China- now this may be news to some of you guys but working in a Chinese plastic factory with no OSHA to save you is quite a bit different than drinking from a water bottle. And don't worry, we will get to the water bottle data soon enough.

**Study #3: Estrogen-dependent proliferation of MCF7 Cells, or, 18 bottles of bitch tits on the wall**
-

This study is the closest thing linked to actually being somewhat valid. In this study an assay is carried out where MCF7 cells are essentially treated with tap water where the solids in it have been concentrated way down from 1.5L to a few mL. For those who don't like commie units that means whatever is in that water is 1500x more concentrated than in your tap water. 

Anyway, so to 1500 MCF7 cells is added all the different water ""extracts"" (this is a highly simplified explanation) and a week or so later they look at the proliferation of the cells. What the hell, you may be asking? Why would you even measure the proliferation of these cells in response to water? Well, as it turns out, MCF7 is an immortal breast cancer cell line that expresses high levels of estrogen receptors and proliferates in response to activation of those receptors. Now if you scroll down to the results you can see that **WOAH**, the relative proliferation increased almost 80% when the evil dire-aids bottled water was used (but only sometimes when DMSO or dimethylsulfoxide is used as a solvent, which could very well be significant because DMSO makes anything dissolved in it pass through cellular membranes)! Big tampon strikes again boys. **But wait... Lets think about this for a second.**

This is an assay carried out in a cell culture dish on a cancerous immortal cell line. Now I have a lot of experience with cancerous cell lines, I work with them every day, and I can tell you that these aren't normal cells. Cancerous cell lines are the kind of thing that you can look at the wrong way and they start dividing- it's literally cancer my dudes. Not only that, but the estrogenic activity is only even significant when DMSO is included (although highly diluted), and the water is ""concentrated"" (look up solid phase extraction if you want in-detail info on this process it's actually fascinating) in a specific way! 

Even if we put all of these potential flaws of methodology aside we can see in the results section that the relative estrogenic activity is equal to that of 1-12 **picrograms (pg) per liter.** For reference, a picogram is 1x10^-12 grams. Putting this in perspective, a liter of water from Tampon-Corp has a truly devestating mass of 0.0000000018% the mass of a single grain of fucking sand. Guys. Oh, and that relative increase in proliferation was all that with just 1500 cells (avg. human has upwards of 15 trillion, or 15x10^12 cells or 10 factors of 10 more).

___________________________________________________________________
**Conclusions**

Now, my dudes. I understand that not everybody can be or wants to be a scientist. If you don't have first-hand experience working with cells and these kinds of methodologies, there would be no possible way to even read through some of these articles (the first one in particular is grueling as hell). **However**, we all have a responsibility to think critically about what we're reading instead of jumping to the conclusion that the government wants to cuck you. Think about it, if plastics were a government conspiracy like some of you apparently think, why would they use them on their own fucking armed forces?!

Next time you read something that tells you you're going to get dire-vagina-period-out-your-dickhole, use the following process to assess the evidence:

1. Look at the model organism in the study. How close is it to human? In scale? Genetically? Is it cancerous? In these cases, rodent models would have been far superior to established cancer cell lines in my opinion.

2. Read the results section first, the introduction second, and the methods last. Look at the figures, do they look right? Are they clear?

3. Where is this info coming from? HuffPo? Or is it a legitimate scientific journal. Is it in all Chinese?

4. Make sure that anyone who disagrees with your uninformed opinions is called a shill, as this argument has been passed down through the ages.

Anyways, my dudes, you're not going to grow bitch tits because you drink out of a water bottle. Is it possible there could be picogram levels of estrogen-mimicking molecules in your water? Yup. But guess what, there's probably about 100x more cockroach jizz in everything you eat, because a picrogram is literally such a small amount that I can't even describe it without scientific notation. So sack up and read the primary literature so you don't look like a dumb ass.

Thanks for reading. Mistakes in this article are a result of late-night writing.

**UPDATE:** Many community members have been asking me to provide scientific context to related issues such as steroid use and aluminum in deodorant. 

I'm happy to see this kind of curiosity but can't address all of the questions. I've decided to make a series of posts where I will review the literature on a specific topic from both sides in plain speak, as well as demonstrate how to assess the literature without having to have 3 degrees. A huge problem with academia is the jargon that locks the public out of the discussion, and the shoddy quality science ""reporting"" that makes it to the public. Let's do something about that.

You can vote for the first topic we will address together, or select other and send me a private message with your suggestion.

1036,7v58i0,"The sub-department I now oversee and my department as a whole are sausage fests. One of my direct reports has been taking advantage of this (even before I came into this role) to basically create a Smurfette effect. She was the second draft pick for the position I got moved into and only lost by a hair. Keep in mind that this is after I saved the company from a coworker's substantial fuckup and demonstrated competence. Meanwhile she's mediocre at her job at best. Crazy to see how far titties can get you. We'll call this woman Susan.

Needless to say she resents the fuck out of me. Thinks my job should be hers and even mentioned such to a former coworker and close friend of mine. Loose lips sink ships, right? She turned up her flirtatiousness ever since, specifically targeting my superior (who is on the executive management team). He's been falling for it hook, line, and sinker. He regards flirting with attractive females as a privilege of rank from what I can tell and, at one point, even had a ""talking to"" with me (doubtless prompted by this bitch) about her feelings and to be nice and blah blah blah.

Naturally, I decided about ten seconds into this conversation that her name should be taken off my phone directory and put onto an unemployment check.

I fabricated a line of analytical reasoning as to why a problem that had existed in the inventory systems of a foreign office (we'll say the German office) had to be addressed now. Someone would have to go to ""Germany"" for about three months (give or take) to fix it. My presence was required here to finish rolling out something that was mid-implementation. So Susan was the only option. Boss man was visibly upset. This was his spank tank material after all. Susan was thrilled. She ""Always loves to travel!""

Unfortunately for Susan, the work waiting for her in ""Germany"" was some of the shittiest, most grueling work in existence. And there was no way to avoid it without it being obvious that she had shirked. So she had to do it. That's irrelevant, but it helped me get through those months knowing that she was miserable.

As soon as she left, I set about finding ""temporary"" help as a replacement. This had been discussed as part of the plan. I quickly found a more than suitable candidate. She was perfect. She was younger than Susan. She was meek and compliant whereas Susan had been boisterous and dominant. She was humble. Most importantly, she was Asian. We will call her Hijun. I told her that the job was temp-to-perm. In a way this was dishonest. But, ultimately, it *was* truthful!

My boss, I knew for a fact, had a thing for Asians. He took to Hijun immediately. Like cancer takes to a prostate. And it just so happened that she was a very, *very* diligent employee as well. Her metrics were far better than Susan's ever were. I took note to mention her success publicly and praise her multiple times.

Fast forward three months and I call Hijun over after making sure Bossman is in his office (which is well within earshot). I tell her, quietly, that the three month period of her employment is ending because the person she replaced is due to come back from ""Germany"" in a week or two (Susan's project ran late because obviously it did). She doesn't understand. I said temp-to-perm, didn't I? Fortunately, I've nailed the ""earnest and surprised"" look. She begins to cry and I offer her a tissue.

On cue, bossman comes over and asks what's going on.

""Well, as you know, Susan is coming back and will be able to resume her duties... So...""

""Oh, right."" I can tell now that Susan had honestly slipped his mind after three months. He seems genuinely torn.

""Unfortunately, it seems there may have been some sort of... language barrier or miscommunication? Hijun was under the impression this would be permanent.""

""Oh, Jeese. That stinks."" Hamster spinning. ""But didn't you say that her numbers have been really good?""

I nod. Hijun is not crying but is still clearly distraught and sniffling. ""That's true. All of her metrics have been stellar. But unfortunately there's not enough work here for two positions.""

""Yeah... there must be something we can do, though.""

He wants an excuse at this point. I have one.

""Well, aren't they still looking to fill that position in accounts payable? Susan had a minor in accounting.""

This position has been filled and vacant on and off for years. Because the manager is an idiot who doesn't know what she wants. This position is a metaphorical toilet with the flushing power of Niagara falls that can dispose of even the largest pieces of human refuse. Namely, Susan. What's more, it is in an entirely different department. But big dick bossman can get her placed there if he wants.

""Hey! That's right!"" Ignores me, immediately turns to Hijun and begins to comfort her. ""Don't worry, Hijun. We've got it. You'll stay on and become permanent in this role and Susan will take a *different* role in the company. Okay?""

She's obviously still broken up a bit, but hopeful. She nods. His white knighting over, he turns back to me to deal with the reality of the decision he's just made. ""Is she still up, you think?""

""Well, it should be 3:40 in 'Germany' now. Do you want me to ask her if this is okay?""

""I'll tell her."" Bossman exits stage left. I let Hijun regain her composure, apologized for the confusion, and made sure to have her made permanent before Susan was back on the same continent. Susan is currently battling the atomic water pressure of the Accounts Payable toilet, Hijun is performing better than ever (she still thanks me sometimes), and bossman can jack off to this nice girl who is not qualified for and has no interest in my position.",1036,0.0,0.24240000545978546,"girl, feel, really, find, still, shit, male, always, leave, relationship"
1037,8ajkgy,"*Edit: Added a few more details under each relevant point so it's as beginner friendly and coherent as possible. Essentially in any interaction concerning sexual intimacy, you should aim for a ""it just happened"" sort of thing, this works best by far*

This is my first ever post as a way of giving back to the community and reporting what I've learned and found what works best. You can check your strengths and weaknesses and know what to improve/how to cater your game, an example is I need to be less of a douchebag and not fail every comfort test that goes my way. This is my first and potentially only post on the sub so hopefully it provides valuable insight despite it being obvious and whatnot

*  **Never Shit Where You Eat**

Definition: Never sleep with a coworker/someone closely associated with your work. I believe girls in the same apartment are fine so long as you watch your back and stay safe, someone in one of your university classes too so long as you approach cautiously. Fellow gym members is a risk, only ever approach the ones that give you strong and plenty IOIs, don't approach the girls that don't. Ever. Basically don't sleep with someone you work often with/around or gym girls that focus on their own thing and don't want to be bothered

This one should be engraved into your mind. It's never worth it, don't fucking do it. It's strongly advised against for good reason. Mixing pleasure and business is not a good idea since she may cause drama or try and fuck you over on your job. Too many risks for the payoff to ever be worth it

* **Never Try Hard**

Definition of trying hard: Sexually escalating and trying it by moving too fast, attempting in short intervals and giving attention regularly. It's cool and all to be direct although if you just make it sex-based she won't cave. Trying hard at first is well paired up with getting yourself into a true ""don't give a fuck"" mood later on, they find that so so sexy, though it's very hard to get put into that mood. Only ever happened to me three times and no clue what caused it

From a post I read before and from what I've seen, girls love it when you look like you live your life with or without them and you can live with them not putting out for you. I've been on both ends  with the same girl, where she told me she started losing interest since I was ""trying too hard"" to me then just genuinely not giving a fuck and it worked out perfectly for me. ""Flow like water"", don't let a woman be a dam you go out of your way to find and push over

* **Never Ever Be Needy**

Anyone who's spent a minute on this sub knows this is one of the cornerstones of the sexual strategy aspect of RP. It's not fun for anyone and a complete turn off. Women desire a man who does his own thing and who countless other women desire and talk about. If you do get needy occupy yourself, you're a grown ass man you got shit to do instead of gazing at the stars wondering ""What could have been"" or picking flowers while muttering ""She loves me, she loves me not"". If any of you kill yourselves over a girl I will personally travel to the afterlife, pull your ass back into the realm of the living and knock some fucking sense into you. Oneitis is a debilitating condition that throws anyone off their game. You need to *shut that shit down*, even if it's a slight ""she's not like other girls"". This also has to do with my point on never settling. More on that later

* **Never Get Jealous**

Girls always try and rattle up suspicion or jealousy/envy in a man to keep them on their dog leash. It's one of their stupid covert games, don't fall for it. You shouldn't ever care. In a high school class my (BP) friend told me ""Man I just heard the girls talking about how they send pics of guys in our class to guys in their contacts list to make them jealous"". I just laughed at him while they were around us and said ""You have so much to learn"". Ended up getting spammed by texts from a girl trying to get my attention which they noticed and started eyefucking me ever since. Poetic

* **Never Lose Your Cool**

Frame. Frame frame frame. Breathe frame, be frame, live frame. This is perhaps the most potent and powerful tool in your arsenal. If a guy wants to get into a fight, as Sun Tzu said, ""The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting."". Don't ever get mad at a girl or anyone, you look like a childish idiot and she dries up like the Sahara desert. Fun fact, every girl I know who's boyfriend did something along the lines of ""She has a man now"" broke up after a week max. It shows insecurity and women can gauge insecurity like sharks can smell blood in the water

* **Never Be Too Much of A Dick**

I really wish I listened and reflected more when I read about comfort tests on here. You need to be able to identify and relate a girl's emotions to game her at your maximum potential. Sure some are going to go for you since you're a complete douchebag though those girls are the less sought after. Charm is the right amount of comedy, mystery, interest and teasing. Do too much of a god thing and it creates an imbalance, in this case teasing. You need to give her an emotional roller coaster of ups and downs, but do too many downs and the ride shuts down

* **Never Be An Emotional Tampon**

Girls always have options no matter what for ""nice"" listeners. You can hear her out from time to time although set boundaries to know what you're about. If any of you have a hard time remaining distant think of it this way: if you won't be her emotional tampon someone else will. And she sure as fuck won't be banging the emotional tampon

* **Never Take Things Personally**

Girls are more scared of rejection than guys, it's why they rarely approach and none can game. It's one small meaningless interaction that could result in you knocking boots or a confidence boost exercise. If she bails, just understand what her nature is and it's not you, it's her. This is including and not limited to; flaking, playing games, shit testing. Not taking things personally also helps with the abundance mentality and DGAF attitude

* **Never Be Afraid of Taking Risks**

Also great life advice for success. Similar to previous point however I know damn well I don't want to live with any regrets in life so I'll take the harmless risk of approaching and seeing how it goes. Best case scenario: Plate or whatever you're looking for
Worse case scenario: Rejection. Despite this you still get out of your comfort zone, ergo improving nonetheless

* **Never Be Interrogative**

What I mean by this is you don't want to ask questions such as ""Want to meet up at this park at a time?"" or ""What's your favourite 11th century artpiece"". Questions are fine and such but don't overdo it. However, **you should never ever ask, you must always command (this does not include sex). Setting logistics especially**. Standard of her ""where are we eating"" or ""I'm free Friday"" is you replying with ""I know this great Chinese place. I'll pick you up at 8"" or ""Let's do a park walk at 6PM Friday"" respectively. I found that using my ending cold approach line to ""Let's exchange numbers, I'll take yours"" works perfectly as it's friendly, a suggestion into a leading command and makes you look like you know what you're doing. I highly suggest implementing it if you have not already

* **Never Betray Your Senses**

If you're seeing red flags galore or feel like you're in the house from Poltergeist, abandon ship. If you sense somethings off or you shouldn't push then don't. Trust your gut. You'll know the difference between butterflies in your stomach to ""some kind of fuckery is going on here"". This point also includes the voice inside your head like ""Don't text her again man, it's only been a day"". Last point is a good example of betraying your senses

* **Never Settle**

""When you settle you get what you settled for"" -A guy who's name I forgot. You need to keep up your standards since mentality makes all the difference and once you start caving in to the occasional Miss McDonalds or Mrs. Human Potato Head since you've been having a ""dry spell"" then numerous problems will arise. Don't do it, only fuck who you believe you should be fucking (while also having major self confidence to uphold high standards). It's principles, it's self discipline and self control. It's right

* **Never Game, Let Alone Fuck a Bipolar Girl**

If you want to open Pandora's box on your dick, be my guest. Just remember the phrase ""Abandon all hope, ye who enter"" when she's starting to flip shit and is a hair strand away from accusing you of abusing her

Symptoms to spot one are listed and not limited to; mood swings, threatening to chop your dick off, screaming and shouting, having the crazy eyes, maniacal laughter 

*With all that being said, the world is your oyster. Go get 'em Tiger. Good luck and enjoy*",1037,2.0,0.30000001192092896,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck"

Stoicism
---

Stoicism is an ancient Greek school of philosophy founded at Athens by Zeno of Citium. The school taught that virtue, the highest good, is based on knowledge, and that the wise live in harmony with the divine Reason (also identified with Fate and Providence) that governs nature, and are indifferent to the vicissitudes of fortune and to pleasure and pain.

That's the textbook definition.  But it's more functional to get to the *how.*  

Doing is the best way to learn.

---

Stoicism keeps the following beliefs:^**
---
* If you are unhappy, it is your fault.
* Everything is temporary
* We are social beings with a social duty
* Hedonism is not the path to happiness
* Fame & Fortune are overrated
* A philosophy of life must be lived
* Do not long for an ideal situation
* Maximize positive emotions and minimize negative emotions

Strategies
---
* Rephrase goals so that they are entirely within your control
* Have nothing you are not prepared to lose
* Live simply
* Negative visualization
* Exercise self-denial
* Resist materialism
* Accept what cannot be changed
* Refuse to consider yourself the victim
* Practice misfortune
* Live in accordance with human nature

---

**Stoicism 101**
---

If you are unhappy, it is your fault
---
You and only you can make you happy.  Other people and other things cannot *make* you happy, but you can find happiness through their medium.  Wood does not make one happy, but cutting, sanding, and assembling wood into a piece of art or furniture can bring happiness *through the actions you take with it.*  Your girl may not make you happy, but being a leading force in your life, and by virtue hers, you can find happiness *through the actions you take with her.*

Inversely, you cannot, and should not expect to, make others happy.  It is their responsibility to find happiness *through the actions they take with you.*

Everything is temporary
---
Life, relationships, your car, *your relationships with women,* are all temporary.  Entering into the idea that *I have a girlfriend* is an easy way of saying, *I don't have to try to do better because I locked down my girl*  This is laziness and sloth.  Nothing is forever, but the longevity of things and relationships, and people can be extended through positive actions and regular maintenance and improvement.

We are social beings with a social duty
---
You are a social creature, and as such, you crave the interactions with other social creatures.  You have friends, a girl or two, maybe children.  These people comprise the network of which you have a *social duty.*  You also have a social duty to those you work with, and your town, and your state, nation, and the world.  Everything you do should be for the betterment of your circles of social duty.  Social duty can lead to gaining AMOG status in a group.

Hedonism is not the path to happiness
---
Hedonism, a defining trait of the *me generation*, is the constant search for self-indulgence.  Hedonism thrives on instant gratification and makes one dependent on the false idea that *other things* and *other people* can and should make them happy.  Hedonism is being a spoiled child; hedonism is looking to lose weight without the effort; hedonism is wanting girls to fuck you without trying to be someone she *actually wants to fuck.*  Hedonism is probably the main counter-point to *Stoicism.*

Fame & Fortune are Overrated
---
Fame and Fortune tie into hedonism; with these things, the ability, and temptation to have more and get more becomes overwhelming.  Fame brings a false happiness because it depends on *other people.*  Since only you can make yourself happy, the requirement of other people fame has nulls this ideal.  Fortune is the more useful of the two, by itself.  If the fortune you've accumulated is the result of fame (considering that everything is temporary, and the poor effects of hedonism) then consider that you haven't a fortune, but instead an amount of wealth that should be used to consider the future, your social duty to your family and community, and as a buffer to the temporary nature of everything.

A Philosophy of Life Must be Lived
---
Red Pill is not a philosophy; it is a *praxeology*; a science of human actions.  Red Pill incorporates many concepts known through evolutionary biology, sociological and psychological studies of macor and micro groups, and some philosophies, mainly *Stoicism.*  Stoicism is not something you are able to wade into, as with all philosophies, it must be lived to be understood.  You can't know it unless you experience it, you cant' learn unless you do it.

Do Not Long For an Ideal Situation
---
This plays into the old axiom of, ""*The grass is greener on the other side.*""  To be clear, it's the idea of thinking, ""*my life sucks, girls won't fuck me.*""  Wishing and talking about it does not make it so.  Doing, makes it so  If your grass is dead and dying, standing outside and talking about how it needs to be watered doesn't actually make the ground wet.  Instead, remember that ""*The grass is greener where you water it*,"" and then go out and water the grass.  Don't *imagine* a better life... make yourself to better to provide a better environment for your relationships to improve.

Maximize Positive Emotions and Minimize Negative Emotions
---
Negative emotions (anger, hate, resentment, etc.) are contraindicated when trying to make something better.  Resenting your girl for whatever reason won't make her change her behavior, and it will kill your mood, and by extension, hers.  Instead, know that: *If you are unhappy, it is your fault* and that you *Should not long for an ideal situation.*  Be happy with what you have, happy that you know how to improve it, and happy that you know you *can* improve it.  Maintaining a positive, optimistic outlook on what is happening allows you to see the possibilities that are hidden by negative thinking.  If one is resolved to not getting rescued, he will not find much use in starting a fire.

---

Now let's examine how we can bring these beliefs to fruition through practice.

Rephrase Goals So That They are Entirely Within Your Control
---
Let's pretend you want to run a 5K race.  You don't know how to run well, and by extension, you don't know how to train.  You get out and run, haphazardly, whenever, and however.  Race day comes and you turn in a paltry time of 26 minutes.  You resolve to be faster so you say, ""I will be faster next time.""

This is garbage thinking.  There is only an immeasurable ""faster"" and an immeasurable ""next time.""  That's anything over your previous time from 1 second or more for a length of time from no until *whenever.*  Use SMART goals:

* Specific
* Measurable
* Achievable
* Realistic
* Time-limited

A SMART goal version of this example: ""I will run a sub-25-minute 5K time in 12 weeks at the next scheduled race.""  

Apply these types of goals to everything, for Red Pillers, the best is to start with the gym: I will lose weight... I will lift x amount of lbs, and turn them into SMART goals.  Once you have SMART goals, you have a time frame within you can apply a schedule and plan.

Have Nothing You Are Not Prepared to Lose &amp;amp;amp; Resist Materialism
---
As Tyler Durden said, ""You are not your fuckin' khakis.""

Your car, your house, you clothes.  These are things, material and simple.  They are the product of your time, effort, and ability -the things you *cannot* live without.  

If your car, house, and all your belongings burned to the ground tomorrow, you would still have the tools to bring those things back in some form.  Your work allowed you the ability to pay for insurance to get new things when everything burns.  Your work is the combination of your time, effort, and ability.  These three things are the basis for all other material things you own.  These are innate to you.  Your house is not.

Live Simply
---
Living simply, or with *austerity,* allows you to appreciate the things you have.  This does not mean live *cheaply*... or even *frugally.*  One can own quality while living simply.  Simple living leads to an uncluttered environment which extends to an uncluttered life.  Your living space is a manifestation of your mind and your mind can be influenced by that living space.  A simple living space has limited distractions.

Negative Visualization
---
Imagine a scenario where your house has burned down.  Your family has no place to live, sleep, eat, etc.  What do you do?  Negative Visualization allows you to plan for the unexpected, or at least plan for the knowable problems that may arise.  Your house is gone.  Can you get a new one?  If so, how?  This is a good chance to exercise SMART goals.  Figure out a problem that hasn't happened, and then plan for that contingency.  This will give you a level of control over your life you didn't previously have.  For Red Pillers, we do this as part of the process of *swallowing* what would happen if I never had sex again?  How would I live?  What would I do?  How would I apply myself in a productive manner?*  Negative visualization leads to an *abundance mentality.*

Exercise Self-Denial &amp;amp;amp; Practice Misfortune
---
Exercising self-denial is the physical manifestation of *negative visualization.*  Live, temporarily, in a way that deprives you of something you *think* you depend on.  Some Red Pillers, while unplugging do this with sex; we call it ""monk mode.""  We distance ourselves from the thing we thought we needed and from the people we thought we needed it from.  In this, we find that we survive just fine and that we now have the energy to devote to *maximizing positive emotions* and working to *make ourselves* happy.  One of the classic ways men practice self-denial is through camping; we commune with nature, with very little (the bare basics in most cases,) and if you do it backpack-style, you limit yourself even further by way of what you carry and that you make yourself distant from society's technological boon, *the car.*

Accept What Cannot be Changed
---
You cannot change the way others are any more than you can change the rotation of the Earth or the expansion of the universe.  In remembering that *your happiness is made only by you* you recognize quickly that attempting to change others is an exercise in futility.  Instead, change yourself, as that is *all* that can be changed.

Refuse to Consider Yourself the Victim
---
You are not the victim.  Inasmuch as you cannot change others to your whim, you need to accept that they cannot change you.  If you feel the part of the victim, it is because you *allowed* that person, or situation, to keep you in a state of negativity.  People do not *victimize* you, you allow yourself to be a target.  Instead, stand up, defy the status quo as you have allowed it to form, and shake the foundations of what was formerly expected of you.  Claiming victim-hood is founded in laziness and a *lack of personal accountability.*

Live in Accordance With Human Nature
---
As you should accept what cannot be changed *directly*, you should recognize that which can be changed *indirectly.* Humans are not special and different.  While there are sociopathic and psychopathic exceptions, people tend to behave in very predictable ways.  By working ourselves into that system, we can effect the changes we want to see in others simply by changing ourselves.  With women, by simply being a better man, we find that our sexual outlook improves because the women around us adjust, and re-set themselves in a very predictable manner, to the new dynamic we have created.  Trying to live as we were, pre-Red Pill leads to similar predictable behavior, just manifested in a different way.

**Lessons Learned**
---

As you unplug, lift, read, and better yourself, examine which of these basic tents you have been following and continue to apply them, and in bettering yourself, figure out which Stoic fundamentals you are missing and add them.  We are working to better ourselves for the sake of ourselves and ultimately our marriages:

* Are you unhappy?  Whose fault is that?  Stop considering yourself the victim.
* Is your unhappiness permanent?  It is not; Set SMART goals, Accept that you can't change others, and improve yourself.
* You have a social duty to your family and friends.  Have you been living up to that job?  Start applying yourself to be better so that others can follow you.
* Are you avoiding your problems in order to find happiness through self-indulgence?  Seek happiness through self-improvement, not self-indulgence.
* Do you wish things were better?  That will not work; *make* things better.  Improve yourself, be better at what you do, set the goals to bring the improvements to fruition.
* Are you focusing on the negative aspects of your life?  A negative thinker sees only the *nots*, a positive thinker sees the *what ifs.*
* Are you depending on other people and things to make your life better?  Step back, imagine a life without, practice that life without, and make a plan for when it happens.

Get a hobby, build something, and lift!

1039,6ubmxc,"I play basketball a few times a week at a local indoor court near my apartment. 


Often I see this guy there, we'll call him Brad. Brad's about 5'9, 28 years old, he's handsome— but only because he takes care of himself. He lifts, get's haircuts, he's in decent shape, lean. He has male friends, he does things, can hold a conversation and takes care of himself. Not a Chad by any stretch... but he's working on himself continuously.


Whenever we're playing basketball in the gym, I often witness Brad approach women charismatically and effortlessly. I've seen him cold approach 8's and 9's, convince them to watch him play basketball for 30 mins, then walk out of the gym with them after the game.


Today was different. I see Brad doing his thing as usual, shooting hoops and approaching women when the game dies down.


Brad see's this blonde HB9 and immediately B-lines to the locker (10 feet away from the court). Walks up to her and starts chatting with her. 2 mins pass, She's not feeling it, resting bitch face and giving him some dirty looks. He keeps at it... invites her to play basketball. She's still not feeling it.


Then about 15 seconds later, she turns her back to him without saying anything at all and gives him the most cold and unexpected *""slam the locker in your face""* rejections I've ever seen. It could have been out of high school musical.


I'll never forget what he said to her.


Just so she could hear him, he calmly — without chagrin, says **""your loss""**, as she walks away.


He picks up his ball, turns around, takes 2 steps and sinks a 3 from way downtown. Continues to play ball for the rest of the night, unfazed.


I commend Brad to get up after rejection like this. There was at least 15 men and women around him that saw exactly what happened. Most men would have social shame or at the very least some humiliation or discomfort. He didn't even flinch. Just turned around, says the truth, then shoots a 3.


We often talk back and forth about abundance mentality on TRP, but only in theory. Maybe some of us are like brad, but surely not all of us are. How many of us are practicing in real life situations like Brad? Who here would have even have approached an HB9 after her workout? I've never seen abundance mentality first hand like this in my life. This man didn't attach any of his value or worth to talking to this woman. He was simply a man who saw a woman he found attractive and approached her to see if she was also interested.


I know Brad personally, he's a great guy, and the words *""your loss""* is exactly the way to describe the how this woman should feel tonight.



*Post some FR's in the comments that you experienced rejection and how you could have handled it differently.*",1039,4.0,0.4293000102043152,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

""My step-daughter wants her ""Real Dad"" to give her away""

My step-daughter will be getting married on August 3rd. The wedding planning has consumed most of her and her mother's life (I say her mother because we aren't married, though we've lived together for 10 years) for the past six months.

My step-daughter graduated last December from University. I paid for her to go to college, though it was a state school, it still ran $40K. She does not have a job and has been living with us for the duration of her college career and since her graduation. I also bought her a car to get back and forth from school when she finished high school.

From time to time her deadbeat father would pop into her life and she would fawn all over him. Although he has not contributed a cent to her education or paid any child support, though that is my girlfriend's fault as c.s. was not part of the settlement, she still loves him and wants him in her life. He stays long enough to break her heart by skipping town and breaking some promise that he made her.

The wedding venue holds 250 people max. I gave them a list of 20 people that I wanted invited, you know, since I was paying for everything. They told me that was no problem and they'd take care of it. So I let these people know they'd be getting an invite and they should save the date. Saturday, I saw one of my friends on this list at the golf course and asked if he was coming. He told me that he wasn't invited. He told me that he got an announcement, but not an invitation. He had it in his back seat (along with probably six months of mail) and showed it to me. Sure enough, it was just an announcement, and my name was nowhere on it. It had her dad's name and her mom's name and not mine.

This led to a pretty big fight with my GF, as I found out that NONE of my list of twenty ""made the cut"" for the final guest list because ""250 people is very tight."" I was pissed, but not a hell of a lot I could do because the important people in my life had already been offended. My GF said ""if some people didn't rsvp yes, I might be able to get a couple people in."" But that is an ultimate slap in the face in my opinion. So, I was boiling on Saturday.

Yesterday, we had a Sunday dinner with the future in-law's family and us and a surprise guest, the ""Real Dad."" At this little dinner my step-daughter announced that her ""Real Dad"" was going to be able to make it to her wedding and that now he'd be able to give her away. This was greeted with a chorus of ""Oh how great"" and ""How wonderful""s.

I don't think I have ever felt so angry and so disrespected. I was shaking. I took a few seconds to gather my composure, because I honestly wasn't sure if I would cry or start throwing punches or both. Once I was sure I'd be able to speak I got up from my chair and said I'd like to make a toast. I can't remember exactly what I said but the gist of it was this:

""I'd like to make a toast."" The sound of spoons against glasses ring in my years. ""It has been my great pleasure to be a part of this family for the past ten years."" Awe, how sweet. ""At this point in my life I feel I owe a debt of gratitude to bride and groom, because they have opened my eyes to something very important."" Confident smiles exchanged. ""They have showed me that my position in this family is not what I once thought it was."" And now a glimmer of confusion and shock begins to spread on the faces in the room. ""Though I once thought of myself as the patriarch or godfather of the family, commanding great respect and sought out for help in times of need, it seems instead that I hold the position of an ATM, good for a stream of money, but not much else. As I have been replaced as host, both on the invitations and in the ceremony, I am resigning my financial duties as host to my successor, Real Dad. So cheers to the happy couple and the path they have chosen."" I finished my drink. ""You all can let yourselves out.""

Is this selfish? I'm supposed to shell out 40 - 50 grand for a wedding that I can't invite anyone to? That I am not a part of? I'm so done with this crap. I'm done with my step-daughter, I'm done with my GF. I transferred the money out of our joint account last night. (she has not had a job since she moved in with me) This morning I called all the vendors I had written checks to for deposits to refund my money. At present it looks like I'll lose around 1500, for the venue, but the other vendors have been great about refunding.

TLDR: You want your ""REAL DAD"" to be on the invitation, to give you away and to sit at the head table, fine, your ""REAL DAD"" can pay for everything too.

EDIT: The immediate aftermath was tantrum and people sitting there mumbling while not actually saying anything to me, but to each other. After much yelling with the GF about me being selfish, I spent the night in my home office and no one knocked on my door, not once. Today's aftermath is kind of depressing for me. GF brought me Bride's wedding planner to show me how much work I was ruining. I thumbed through it, found a page in the music section for Father / Daughter dances. All of the songs were catered to Real Dad's taste. So I thought they were just being disrespectful, but now I'm feeling like they never really gave a crap at all, especially since the menu included two ingredients I'm allergic to, that actually made me laugh. Either way, I'm glad to be done, returned the planner and asked her when she and bride could move out. Also, I never promised to pay for the wedding. I offered them the use of my home when they were sure it was going to be small, but other than that, all I've heard is how it's the Bride's family that should pay, so, let it be the bride's family then, aka, not me.

EDIT: June 9th 1:15 am. Girlfriend and Bride are now moved out. They are moving in with the groom. It was very hard not to be petty with some of the ""belongings"" they took with them, but it's done and I switched out the locks and now it's time for a brew. I can't believe how popular this story got, but I feel good to be given support by so many. If I find out what happens with the wedding, I will let you know, but I can't guarantee that I will put in the effort to find out. From what I've heard they are trying to ""scale things back"" and get his parents to help out. GF burned bridges when I found out she tried to write herself a check on our joint account the day after the unpleasantness. By then I had already moved money, so I guess I'm a bigger ass than her, but I could feel it coming. That's all.

1041,3rjch9,"Forgive me if this incoherent, I am weeping as I write this. I am a 24 year old man. I fell into dating an older single mother earlier this year. She cheated on me and when I tried to break up with her she called the cops and said I abused her. The cops arrested me without even asking me if it was true. I was bailed out and given a 60 day protective order to stay away from her. I ignored her countless text, emails, voicemails, handwritten letters left on my trucks windshield for 2 weeks. She told me if I met her she would tell the cops the truth that she made it up. I came over and she gave me to falsely dated letters of confession. We were driving down the road later that night almost to her house in a suburban neighborhood when she, out of nowhere, threw my dog out of my vehicle, jumped out and ran to a random house screaming as if I was trying to rape her. This was right in the middle of a civil discussion, completely by surprise. The cops arrested me again for violating the protective order. Jail again. My state appointed attorney told me to accept the plea deal. 8 years probation, 250 hours of community service etc, and that I'd have 30 days to change my mind and think about it. He lied. I had 30 days to appeal and the judge has to decide if I can get my day in court. Hired good attorney for 7500 dollars to appeal. Judge takes it under consideration for 2 weeks and I get a call not 2 hours ago saying the motion is denied. I have a mountain of evidence showing I'm innocent. I am an army veteran with no prior criminal record from a good relatively wealthy family. I had a good future in front of me. I don't know where I am going with this. I just had to get this off of my heart. I have a felony on my record now and my future is ruined without ever even having a day in court.

1042,7ivr8k,"The words that I'm about to write are a core foundation of masculinity, they are a part of the line that separates men from women. This is an art that must be practiced, and in do time you will reap it's benefits.

Let me tell you, a lot of men these days are straight up gay, really. They suck this world's dick & swallow, when it should be the other way arround. You're a slave to the situation and have the emotional strength/stability of a bitch on her cycle. Here's a key ability that a lot of us are missing today.

* Suffer In Silence

I know I always got pissed off when my father told me this. I'd fall out of a tree and get the wind knocked out of me,  ""suffer in silence"" is what I got.
My girlfriend cheats on me and goes with another man ""suffer in silence"". I have to a lot of chores to do that will take all fucking day, ""suffer in silence"". I'm about to get my ass whipped for setting stuff on fire when I was told not to, ""Turn around and suffer in silence"". I didn't know until now that I was being groomed into an emotional stronghouse.

The very act of complaining or telling someone your problems is weakness, for the mere fact that you're trying to let someone else hold the emotional burden you have. That's all complaining is, a cry for help or relief from an outside source other than yourself.

Suffering in Silence goes hand in hand with being tough. It's being strong for others in the midst of soul crippling pain. It's carrying your own weight and getting the job done.

Men are productive & logical  (At least a few of you still are) and we shouldn't have time for things that are counterproductive like complaining/crying. It gets nothing done, it solves no problem. Complaining is what women do, because most the time they don't have the physical capability to get shit done themselves. 
 
To sum this up, here's one of the greatest quotes from TWD for yall to keep in mind.

""If you have to eat shit, best not to nibble. 'Bite, chew, swallow, repeat. goes quicker.""

1043,emc7sz,"Military vet that went through some shit. For the past 6 months I was on the street and going from shelter to shelter. 

You know how many shelters there were for battered women? Or women in general? Dozens upon dozens. I couldn't believe it. I've been denied entry, turned away, and kicked out for stupid shit. 

I was at a men's shelter and went to the other side of town for a couple of job interviews. The buses ran late but I told the shelter manager that I wouldn't be able to make curfew. 

He acted as if he understood but as soon as I came back this fucker gave me a ""warning"". After three warnings you're kicked out for 90 days. 

I was like fuck this shit. They also had a policy of making those with income (I get VA disability compensation) to set 50% aside for savings. Sounds reasonable until you realize that you need their permission to access your own money and fuck waiting 2 years in a shelter to give you section 8 housing. Like who can live like that? 

I was kicked out after I withdrew all of my savings without their permission twice. 

Call me a narcissist or a slave to my ego, but I felt relieved to be from under their thump. As if I had to be grateful to them for letting me sleep in a bunk bed with other Vietnam war vets who are coughing up a lung and spreading the flu around. 

At the end of the day, the only person I need to depend on is myself and MY own resources.

So I was back on the streets. I had a plate that lived 7 miles away. At the time her car was fucked and I needed a place to lay low so I said ""fuck it"" and walked. I've done 20 mile hikes with the Marines in full gear and a medpack, so I remind myself that 7 miles in the cold with a backpack and street clothes was nothing. 

Once I made it there and slept for the night I managed to get ahold of a case worker that helped me look for a spot. Living off of hotel rooms were killing me and I couldn't stay at my plate's place long term because a man needs his own castle and you can't let someone else have the power to kick you out and control your destiny. Been there, done that. 

My job interviews fell through so I went from place to place in search of work. One time I stupidly was stuck in the cold with a dead phone and needed a place to charge it. 

Damn near EVERY establishment denied me entry. 

It was like I was the scum of the Earth. Security guards confronting me as if I was a wanted criminal just because I asked to borrow an outlet to charge my phone. 

Finally after what seemed like hours of walking, I stumbled upon a boogie Marriot hotel. I thought that there was no way they'd let me sit down and charge my phone. 

Lo' and behold they were more than happy enough to let me sit down and charge my phone. In fact the receptionist said ""Take all the time that you need."" Almost brought a tear to my eyes. 

After a week of wandering and sleeping on park benches, I managed to stumble on a motel that was hiring. I negotiated my pay along with a permanent room in the motel for work. 

As I sit here in my room and reflect on my journey I realize that I lost everything I had built from a couple years ago. I had to crawl through the mud, sleep in the rain, and ask for favors that NO ONE was willing to help me with. 

There is a point where you become so angry that you become laser focused. It's like tunnel vision.

 I was so OVER everything. I was over with being broke, over with everyone shitting on me, over with being kicked out of local establishments, and over having less than a THIRD of the resources that women get, that I obsessively searched for a solution. 

Suddenly, what I lost didn't matter. Reaching new heights did. 

And it starts now. 

If you've ever been in my shoes then you know exactly what I'm talking about. No one cares about your struggles, and no one cares about YOU. If you can't provide anything then you might as well die. 

I looked back at the lessons from those who lost everything and the mindset they had to bounce back. Steve Jobs being removed from Apple, Napoleon escaping exile and returning to France, Abraham Lincoln failing practically every business venture he's ever had, etc. 

They used their failures as a foundation to build their power because the harsh truth is that only YOU can see it through and bend the world to YOUR will. Don't bend your will to appease world. 


There is comfort in knowing that no one truly gives a flying FUCK about you because it sets you free. I demanded that the motel manager let me stay and work because why not? What did I have to lose by trying? 

Even my social worker was surprised, but my ambitions have not been sated. I need to save as much as I can and get my own condo or apartment. Hell I had a dream about a penthouse overlooking the city. It's time to get to work.

1044,6if639,"Letter to a younger self.

Here are some things that are going to happen to you. Take heed and avoid the bad things, make the good things happen, and while there will still be a struggle, it may be a better journey than where your life has led you to be at 50. 

So many people act as something that they are not. Most people don’t have the integrity they claim they do. Most people wont say what it is they really want, and may conceal their real intentions. Even the best among us. Beware of the hidden lies and cons after going in a given direction. 

Resist what does not seem right. Move on, continue your search, keep open to new people and opportunities and shut down all those that will suck you soul out of you with drama, diversions, and decadence.

What you see to lure you in will never be what you get. Power is in manipulating others with what they want. Power is the lie that says you are worth nothing when in truth you have every right. Power is the lie that isolates you when the truth is you belong in the world. 

Technology, especially in reference to the Internet, actively isolates everyone more than it brings people together. Piece by piece technology interferes with every human interaction and replaces it with a simulation. The wealthiest people in the world, whatever your measure of wealth is, are those who are the most social. Consider how many people a spiritual or political leader has met in his life, and consider how much of a rich life that can represent. Isolation, by whatever cause, is poverty.

Most of your aspirations will never come to pass. Often, your aspirations will be used against you and for profit. Still if you want something, you must do much more research and learning about what is really needed to require it, you should do much more work to learn what that is than you expect you must do. As for your deepest desires that align with who you are, find a way to live them. Regret can drive you mad. 

In this modern age, there are endless lures to distract you from even beginning to think about what you truly need to do to improve your plight. A massive amount of things pushed in front of you is a lie. Consider the massive industry of unhealthy carbohydrates, pornography, political propaganda, overpriced products of every description, so much of it a contrived need.
 
Other people don’t have your interest in mind. Not even the people closest to you. However, if you can find or creating a small group of like minded people who share knowledge and resources among each other, it can be the most valuable method to improving your own life. 

Don’t remain working at home forever. Turn it into something else eventually or move on. It is always in somebody else's interest to keep you isolated. Do this if you must, but it is isolating, and you belong in the world. It is in somebody else's interest to keep you at home. There are no assurances that you will be sufficiently supported to cover all your costs, with the depreciation of your equipment, inflation, and the imperative to continue to invest in your life savings. 

Get work in the greater community, where the real opportunities are. The commute may be costly and frustrating, people toxic, but obviously the ones who flourish and prosper are those exposed to each other in a work place, out in the world, not shut up at home consulting.

The world is being destroyed with lies, especially when profit is possible. Every possible angle is tried in the desperate struggle for anything, and in the belief that this way is the only way that matters, because everyone else practices it. Still it is not too much to strive for a little peaceful square of it for yourself. It is also possible to end up with nothing despite the best of intentions. 

Nobody wants you to know any of the above. It is in the interest of someone else that keeps you isolated, divided, and unaware of it. You must come up with the solutions to these problems yourself.

",1044,4.0,0.3246000111103058,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
1045,8v9fd2,"**I. Never say ‘I Love You’ first**

Women want to feel like they have to overcome obstacles to win a man’s heart. They crave the challenge of capturing the interest of a man who has other women competing for his attention, and eventually prevailing over his grudging reluctance to award his committed exclusivity. The man who gives his emotional world away too easily robs women of the satisfaction of earning his love. Though you may be in love with her, don’t say it before she has said it. Show compassionate restraint for her need to struggle toward yin fulfillment. Inspire her to take the leap for you, and she’ll return the favor a thousandfold.

**II. Make her jealous**

Flirt with other women in front of her. Do not dissuade other women from flirting with you. Women will never admit this but jealousy excites them. The thought of you turning on another woman will arouse her sexually. No girl wants a man that no other woman wants. The partner who harnesses the gale storm of jealousy controls the direction of the relationship.

**III. You shall make your mission, not your woman, your priority**

Forget all those romantic cliches of the leading man proclaiming his undying love for the woman who completes him. Despite whatever protestations to the contrary, women do not want to be “The One” or the center of a man’s existence. They in fact want to subordinate themselves to a worthy man’s life purpose, to help him achieve that purpose with their feminine support, and to follow the path he lays out. You must respect a woman’s integrity and not lie to her that she is “your everything”. She is not your everything, and if she is, she will soon not be anymore.

**IV. Don’t play by her rules**

If you allow a woman to make the rules she will resent you with a seething contempt even a rapist cannot inspire. The strongest woman and the most strident feminist wants to be led by, and to submit to, a more powerful man. Polarity is the core of a healthy loving relationship. She does not want the prerogative to walk all over you with her capricious demands and mercurial moods. Her emotions are a hurricane, her soul a saboteur. Think of yourself as a bulwark against her tempest. When she grasps for a pillar to steady herself against the whipping winds or yearns for an authority figure to foil her worst instincts, it is you who has to be there… strong, solid, unshakeable and immovable.

**V. Adhere to the golden ratio**

Give your woman 2/3 of everything she gives you. For every three calls or texts, give her two back. Three declarations of love earn two in return. Three gifts; two nights out. Give her two displays of affection and stop until she has answered with three more. When she speaks, you reply with fewer words. When she emotes, you emote less. The idea behind the golden ratio is twofold — it establishes your greater value by making her chase you, and it demonstrates that you have the self-restraint to avoid getting swept up in her personal dramas. Refraining from reciprocating everything she does for you in equal measure instills in her the proper attitude of belief in your higher status. In her deepest loins it is what she truly wants.

**VI. Keep her guessing**

True to their inscrutable natures, women ask questions they don’t really want direct answers to. Woe be the man who plays it straight — his fate is the suffering of the beta. Evade, tease, obfuscate. She thrives when she has to imagine what you’re thinking about her, and withers when she knows exactly how you feel. A woman may want financial and family security, but she does not want passion security. In the same manner, when she has displeased you, punish swiftly, but when she has done you right, reward slowly. Reward her good behavior intermittently and unpredictably and she will never tire of working hard to please you.

**VII. Always keep two in the kitty**

Never allow yourself to be a “kept man”. A man with options is a man without need. It builds confidence and encourages boldness with women if there is another woman, a safety net, to catch you in case you slip and risk a breakup, divorce, or a lost prospect, leading to loneliness and a grinding dry spell. A woman knows once she has slept with a man she has abdicated a measure of her power; when she has fallen in love with him she has surrendered nearly all of it. But love is ephemeral and with time she may rediscover her power and threaten to leave you. It is her final trump card. Withdrawing all her love and all her body in an instant will rend your soul if you are faced with contemplating the empty abyss alone. Knowing there is another you can turn to for affection will fortify your will and satisfy your manhood.

**VIII. Say you’re sorry only when absolutely necessary**

Do not say you’re sorry for every wrong thing you do. It is a posture of submission that no man should reflexively adopt, no matter how alpha he is. Apologizing increases the demand for more apologies. She will come to expect your contrition, like a cat expects its meal at a set time each day. And then your value will lower in her eyes. Instead, if you have done something wrong, you should acknowledge your guilt in a glancing way without resorting to the actual words “I’m sorry.” Pull the Bill Clinton maneuver and say “Mistakes were made” or tell her you “feel bad” about what you did. You are granted two freebie “I’m sorry”s for the life of your relationship; use them wisely.

**IX. Connect with her emotions**

Set yourself apart from other men and connect with a woman’s emotional landscape. Her mind is an alien world that requires deft navigation to reach your rendevous. Frolic in the surf of emotions rather than the arid desert of logic. Be playful. Employ all your senses. Describe in lush detail scenarios to set her heart afire. Give your feelings freedom to roam. ROAM. Yes, that is a good word. You’re not on a linear path with her. You are ROAMING all over, taking her on an adventure. In this world, there is no need to finish thoughts or draw conclusions. There is only need to EXPERIENCE. You’re grabbing her hand and running with her down an infinite, labyrinthine alleyway with no end, laughing and letting your fingers glide on the cobblestone walls along the way.

**X. Ignore her beauty**

The man who trains his mind to subdue the reward centers of his brain when reflecting upon a beautiful female face will magically transform his interactions with women. His apprehension and self-consciousness will melt away, paving the path for more honest and self-possessed interactions with the objects of his desire. This is one reason why the greatest lotharios drown in more love than they can handle — through positive experiences with so many beautiful women they lose their awe of beauty and, in turn, their powerlessness under its spell. It will help you acquire the right frame of mind to stop using the words hot, cute, gorgeous, or beautiful to describe girls who turn you on. Instead, say to yourself “she’s interesting” or “she might be worth getting to know”. Never compliment a girl on her looks, especially not a girl you aren’t fucking. Turn off that part of your brain that wants to put them on pedestals. Further advanced training to reach this state of unawed Zen transcendence is to sleep with many MANY attractive women (try to avoid sleeping with a lot of ugly women if you don’t want to regress). Soon, a Jedi lover you will be.

**XI.  Be irrationally self-confident**

No matter what your station in life, stride through the world without apology or excuse. It does not matter if objectively you are not the best man a woman can get; what matters is that you think and act like you are. Women have a dog’s instinct for uncovering weakness in men; don’t make it easy for them. Self-confidence, warranted or not, triggers submissive emotional responses in women. Irrational self-confidence will get you more pussy than rational defeatism.

**XII.  Maximize your strengths, minimize your weaknesses**

In the betterment of ourselves as men we attract women into our orbit. To accomplish this gravitational pull as painlessly and efficiently as possible, you must identify your natural talents and shortcomings and parcel your efforts accordingly. If you are a gifted jokester, don’t waste time and energy trying to raise your status in philosophical debate. If you write well but dance poorly, don’t kill yourself trying to expand your manly influence on the dancefloor. Your goal should be to attract women effortlessly, so play to your strengths no matter what they are; there is a groupie for every male endeavor. Except World of Warcraft.

**XIII. Err on the side of too much boldness, rather than too little**

Touching a woman inappropriately on the first date will get you further with her than not touching her at all. Don’t let a woman’s faux indignation at your boldness sway you; they secretly love it when a man aggressively pursues what he wants and makes his sexual intentions known. You don’t have to be an asshole, but if you have no choice, being an inconsiderate asshole beats being a polite beta, every time.

**XIV. Fuck her good**

Fuck her like it’s your last fuck. And hers. Fuck her so good, so hard, so wantonly, so profligately that she is left a quivering, sparking mass of shaking flesh and sex fluids. Drain her of everything, then drain her some more. Kiss her all over, make love to her all night, and hold her close in the morning. Own her body, own her gratitude, own her love. If you don’t know how, learn to give her squirting orgasms.

**XV. Maintain your state control**

You are an oak tree. You will not be manipulated by crying, yelling, lying, head games, sexual withdrawal, jealousy ploys, pity plays, shit tests, hot/cold/hot/cold, disappearing acts, or guilt trips. She will rain and thunder all around you and you will shelter her until her storm passes. She will not drag you into her chaos or uproot you. When you have mastery over yourself, you will have mastery over her.

**XVI.  Never be afraid to lose her**

You must not fear. Fear is the love-killer. Fear is the ego-triumph that brings abject loneliness. You will face your fear. You will permit it to pass over and through you. And when your ego-fear is gone you will turn and face your lover, and only your heart will remain. You will walk away from her when she has violated your integrity, and you will let her walk when her heart is closed to you. She who can destroy you, controls you. Don’t give her that power over yourself. Love yourself before you love her.

The closer you follow the letter of these commandments, the easier you will find and keep real, true unconditional love and happiness in your life.

1046,553gwd,"In club/bar environments it's often thought the most difficult approach of all is directly approaching a group of uber hot women and successful endgame of taking one  home. This post demonstrates a number of methods to give these  girls the good seeing too they all crave and make everyone happy in the process.
The methods outlined can be deconstructed and used in isolation in various other situations, but in this case they're usually all needed due to our quarry being in a group and all hot. Social engineering  methods will run alongside psychological ones for maximum impact.
 The group should be of a minimum of four women and a maximum of ten, and preferably receiving a lot of passive attention from other males.
 
Please note: This is a meta strategy to achieve an end goal. If at any point your target shows genuine interest you can skip steps, as you're already where you want to be (but watch for compliance tests).

**Step 1: Identifying Your Targets**
The first step is deciding which  girls you're going to use as your gateway strategy. I say, ""girls"" because as well as selecting a target (your end game girl) you will also need to identify one of the other girls as a leverage  point for the social dynamic aspect of the method.

[ In this case it doesn't have to be mother hen as the status of the girls in the group is  pretty similar so there's little difference in *""ranking""* due to them all being 9's or 10's.]

 The girl to use as leverage will be the girl most interested in being approached and thus most likely ascribed by the other girls unconsciously as their biggest sexual  rival. To identify her, study the group carefully. Your selection will  seem less interested in the inane female chit chat taking place and will tend to scan the environment, looking around to check who is in the venue (which Chads) more so than the other girls.

 She's looking to see which guys are there as it's her intention to get laid that night. She will most likely be wearing the most revealing outfit in the group and peaking in her ovulation cycle. Possibly wearing something red or maybe just red lipstick or nails as women seem to have a predilection for the colour -combined with skimpy outfits- when they're at their most fertile, and thus at their horniest.

[Not wearing red isn't a deal breaker, but if you're 50/50 over two girls in the group, then use the red wearing one as your default selection. A number of scientific studies have correlated the colour to women at their most fertile/horny. As the saying goes *""Red shoes, no knickers""*.
 
 Women are always checking out other girls in public venues to monitor their status in the ongoing attraction hierarchy - but if you watch - you will see that girls with red clothing or nails/lipstick receive particular attention when they're first spotted. The other girls know full well the significance of what's going on, even if it's just on an unconscious level.

 The other girls in the group will know this too unconsciously and attempt to engineer spoiling strategies to counter their rival. You may notice they will look at her more to check what's she's up to and rubberneck during conversations they're having with the others to keep tabs on her: Watch for this.

 The final sign is a body language indicator much beloved by used car salesmen and one (now that you've read this) you're going to see, all the time and even notice yourself doing it to the point you say ""WTF!"" when you see the hidden matrix of attraction cues going on around you.


 Have you ever seen two people who know each other, meet and stop in the street for a chit chat, but one needs to get away because they're busy? Have you noticed what happens to the angle of one of their feet? It POINTS towards the direction they want to go: the direction they were originally heading, it's unconscious body language leakage indicating an ongoing desire that's found even in higher primates.

 Good car salesmen know this too, when they're chatting to a prospect on the lot they're keeping a close eye on where your foot is pointing as THAT'S the car you like. Your foot points towards things you like, and away from things you don't. We all do it, I do it, you do it and hot bitches in bars do it.

 Of all  the body language clues  the most accurate (and only ones which can be used in isolation) are eye contact and foot pointing. When you're stood in a bar or chatting to your buddies, the default position for you feet are the 5 minutes to 1 position. Look for girls who have a foot deviating from this stance unless there's a good reason, then look to see where it's pointing.

[In fact; next time you're in a bar or club with your buddies, look towards where one of your **own** feet are pointing. If one of them is pointed away from its default position then it's very likely pointing towards some hottie you have your eye on]

**In Summary**: The girl you are going  to use as leverage to assist your entry will be exhibiting what's known as an *""R cluster""*.


* Reconnaissance: She's scanning the bar looking for which guys (Chads) are in the venue as potential partners.
* Revealing: She will most likely be the most sexily dressed of the group.
* Red: She will most likely be wearing the colour red.
* Real Interest: One of her feet will be pointing away from the group and towards where her real interest lays, usually a man or group of men.


[Disclaimer: allow for pointing which may be towards the bar (she wants a drink), the toilets (she needs to pee), the dancefloor (she wants to dance) or the exit (she wants to leave) although you will only see these indicators when she's in conversation with someone  else. If she's not engaged in something she'll just act on what she wants without pointing ]

 Under any other circumstances this is the girl whom you should target in an approach strategy; whether it be a mother hen gateway -then move to your interest- or a direct approach to your interest from off the bat. Either way this is the girl most DTF that night.

 In this case however, with the group all being uber hotties this is the girl you will use as your leverage  point for entry  - without activating any alarm bells or bitch shields [sure you can game this girl after, once you're established yourself ] but the purpose of this strategy is gaining access first, disqualifying yourself from your approach girl (albeit temporarily) and then use your game skills to move things on.

 Your actual target girl is the next one down on the *""R cluster""* scale. She will be exhibiting some or all of the *""R cluster""* traits (though not to the extent of your leverage girl) but also target girl will be rubber necking your leverage  girl as her prime sexual rival that night. Women pick up on other girls who are ovulating on an unconscious level and adjust their behaviours sub consciously by mate guarding their partner more if they have one, and cockblocking their female friends if they're both single. You're going to use this unconscious behavioural drive for your own ends.


**Step 2: The approach.**
In this situation you have two types of frame.
 1/ The extant frame: Group of super hotties too good for anyone in the bar and *""girl power""* blowing off men and acting like a pack of bitches.

 2/ The intrinsic frame: The real frame, a group of sexual rivals jockeying for status, utilising devious feminine psychological methods on each other, but pretending to be best girly friends while they do it.

 The problem is:  An extant frame can be pretty solid due to what's known as embodied cognition and the girls actually start acting as if this **is** the reality they're in,  they start feeding their emotional states off each other in a feedback loop known as *""Limbic  resonance""* and post hoc rationalising their own behaviour (known as *""Hamstering""*....) to avoid cognitive dissonance.

 In broscience this is called *""Believing your own shit""*.
A radical deframe is required. Gentlemen, such a deframing  exists.

**""The Queens Of Sheba Opener.""**

 Internalise your RP mindset as the **selector** and approach your target girl direct (ensure she has a full drink as you don't want any distractions or default ""drink tooling"" programs firing up). Make sure she sees you are approaching so you don't trigger an auto pilot response by surprising her, then stop in front of her as if weighing her up for a few seconds, then ask the question.

*""Who's your friend?""*

 She'll be expecting a chat up line or random beta validation, but gets surprise instead (the type we DO need)  which derails normal shit testing programming (we're also generating an emotional response here, which is good) but curiosity will make her ask...

*""Which one?""* [ that's why we need a minimum of 4 girls in the group ].

 With a nod of your  head towards your leverage girl reply...

*""The one all the guys are interested in""*

 This is a **huge** deframe. There she is enjoying all this attention and validation, then all of a sudden the rug is pulled from under her: The attention and validation may not actually be for her!

 Hamster central rapidly boots up to protect her self-image.

*""The guys are looking at all of us....?""*

*""Is nobody actually interested in me and it's actually my friend that's creating all this interest from guys...?""*

*""I'm beautiful, but is she so much more attractive than me that all these guys don't care?""*

*""Am I the least attractive of my friends...?""*

*""What the fuck is my status in the group...?""*

All these thoughts go through her head in a split second as you've just triggered an *""imposter syndrome""* program to run in her mind. Not only that, but the source of it is her prime sexual rival who she unconsciously ascribes as a threat.

Oh fucking dear...

 Her status is now in limbo and  needs a reference point to stabilise itself so her limbic brain creates a sense of dread  causing her to reframe from the bottom up to achieve some stability to build from. The dread is hard-wired into her brain: In the ancestral environment a rapid change in circumstances could mean imminent danger or a big survival opportunity. The limbic brain doesn't trust your pre-frontal cortex (the conscious) to deal with it so pulls rank and drops into *heuristic* mode.
 
Heuristics are nothing more than pre-wired emotional responses on how to deal with something quickly. They come from the emotional brain and are combinations of responses based on previous similar experiences (the social emotions like, shame, guilt, jealousy etc) with some actually hard-wired into the brain's source code (like fear, anger, lust etc ). When these heuristics are running then you're also susceptible to influence, as you're locking onto someone else's frame as a scaffolding to bring you back to normality/stasis and the ""emotional traffic highway"" is now open for emotions coming in the opposite direction (from the other person).

 Your frame as selector and alpha is incorporated into her own.

[ To the vast majority of girls *""status""* within their peer group (which used to be the tribe) is of considerable importance as it had to be kept a close eye on in the ancestral environment to maximise the potential of mating with the highest alpha male they could get. It had to be monitored at all times and like I said action taken to avoid any potential loss and seize on the opportunity for any potential improvement.]
 
With very hot girls status is even more important  as being *""top girl""* was the genetic jackpot for their genes. These girls now pretty much have everything, the looks, the orbiters, the protectors, and all the other benefits which come from being an uber hottie. The one thing they have to work for is their status/value with other uber hotties in their group/tribe.

 Lost at sea she now starts to do something she very rarely does: She starts qualifying herself to you and sabotaging her rival.


**Step 3: The Lock In**

**Important** If you start validating her now, then any potential attraction will disappear very quickly. Remember this as you will have an urge to do so.

 The behaviour you drop into now is that of *""amused mastery""* with a heavy emphasis of skepticism. Cross your arms when she's validating herself, but listen to the criteria she's basing herself judged worth upon. See if you can find an adjective she seems keen on which you can use to preface the word *""Confident""*. When you've identified the word then make sure to slightly nod when you hear it (more about this later, but it's to do with what are called *""trancewords""*.) The nod is a way of analogically marking it through body language so that its significance is processed unconsciously, as body language is decoded by the unconscious brain first and the conscious secondly, but only if it appears to be incongruous will the conscious boot up to give it ""due process"".

Keep a wry amused smile on your face, she will sense that you're not taking the bait and most likely go some light kino on you to punctuate her emotional state and expect you to invest with some validation. Kino  her back, but always in a pushing fashion and don't look where you touch (it's creepy). Because of her emotional state your kino won't be processed at a conscious level as the cognitive buffer is filled with other concerns, but unconsciously it's getting through to her attraction centres.


**Step 4 The Lock Down**
 The key now is to drop her out of her emotional state temporarily and then spike it back up again using a process known as *""refractionation""*. Basically when someone comes out and then back into the same emotional state, the second time they go into it, it's more powerful. It's a method used by the *""speed seduction""* community to generate high levels of arousal in a woman, but in this case we're just using it for a different emotional model to suit our strategy.

 Uncross your arms with a sigh, relax and then change the subject to something mundane going on in the venue as if you're just chatting to one of your buddies. Men do not do this to uber hotties as their usual remit is to try to impress them. She will think you've disqualified her (causing slight confusion) as a potential partner and up your ascribed value in her mind. Carry on the conversation for about a minute and then drop the line.
*""Actually you have three big advantages over your friend""* (leverage girl).

[Credit for this goes once again to Mystery and was originally known as the *""Three Things About You Technique""*. Its methodology was to tell a girl two things about herself attraction wise that she didn't know, but not the third. The PUA could then either go sarge other girls or go to the washroom or bar knowing he had inoculated the girl from further approaches by other guys hanging around as she always wanted to find out the third.]

 It uses a cognitive bias we all have known as the *""Zeigernic effect""* and is very effective [I can vouch for its impact as I've had girls come to a bar they knew I was going next, wait outside a wash room for me, and even been pulled out of a taxi to find out the elusive third thing.]
 
**The Three Things**: This time, however we're going to use the *""things""* as vehicles for some pretty devious and cunning psychological deep mind influence.

 When she asks what they are, use the ones below and make sure to preface the first with the words *""The first one is""*. This is to create a language pattern known as an *""Ordinal"".

 An *""Ordinal""* is a presupposition that there will be a number of things. By using the word ""first"" you're implying that there will be a second, third, etc. The second, third may not even exist, but the listener presupposes that they do as you used the word ""first"".

[ The woman already knows there will be three things, but in this case you're using it a reinforcer to prevent cognitive drift ]

 Then use the word ""Because"". ""Because"" is a statement as opposed to a question and various studies have discovered the word as a preface generates more influence from the speaker. This is because the laws of cause and effect are programmed into all higher animal brains, but by using the word at the beginning of our list (use it only for the first thing) and going through the list in this order, we are starting a process called *""State Titration"" so each separate ""thing"" titrates into the next one, making the process seamless and generating *""cognitive fluency"" to prevent her critical factor booting up.

 [Count them off on your fingers as you do so. In this way you're again using a body language cue to anchor them.]

1/ "" The first thing is because...."" Then a comment on her appearance, but **not** anything physical. It's important that it's something which you genuinely like as the very fact that you have spotted it means it will be something which she wore for that purpose. Something like her dress or shoes making her look *""classy""* or *""sophisticated""* as if these are essential criteria for you in a partner (if you DO have essential criteria then use those instead as it will help your congruence).
 
She will see this as an advantage she has over her fellow beauty leverage girl and mentally agree.

 You have just started what's known as a *""Yes Set""* (getting her mind into the house of yes) to ease the next two things through.

2/ A comment on how she's a friendly girl and not standoffish. The reason for this is you're *""priming""* the *""friendly""* behaviour mindset (by ""half cocking"" the relevant network of neurons"" ) into her brain, so she will more likely to act friendly and  less keen to start shit testing you. Because you've already got her brain into yes mode (the essence of the *""yes set""*) from your first statement and you're titrating emotional state, her critical factor  (the pre-frontal cortex) usually lets the idea into her mind without much introspection. ( No need to use ""because"" or ""The .......thing is"", from now on as their work is done ).

3/ Now we use the most Machiavellian attraction trigger in existence...

 The Amygdala Feedback Loop.

 But first some background. You may have noticed I'm a big proponent of *""embodied cognition""*. This is for good reason. It's commonly reasoned that when the mind wants the body to do something, it sends a signal to cause the result it requires. This is true, but only half the story. When the body commits the action the mind requests, it sends a signal back to the brain to announce its new state. The brain analyses the return signal and tweaks its instructions in a feedback loop to fine-tune everything and achieve maximum efficiency.

 However...if you consciously induce that state in yourself or someone else then the unconscious picks up the return signal and assumes that the signal is the current *""state of play""* of how things are, and sychronises itself to it, feeding back the new mental model to the body in an ever strengthening loop until the new state becomes the new reality.

 There's been a lot of research into this and the original model was proven by researchers who asked test volunteers to read jokes with and without a pencil held in their mouth. They discovered that the volunteers found the jokes funnier with the pencils then without them.

Why?

Holding the pencil in the mouth requires the face to use the *""Zygomatic major muscle""* to do so. This muscle is also the one which unconsciously triggers when we smile. The brain senses that the muscle is triggering and infers that activity is happening in the body which correlates to a happy/funny state. Instead of the feedback loop going *""brain to body to brain to body....""* it begins at the state of the *""body""* instead. The mind adopts the state of the body (happy) to avoid dissonance and the new state becomes the norm, but in this case...
 You find the jokes funnier.

 So...we trigger a behaviour in the girl which correlates to her being attracted to someone.

**WARNING**

 Sometimes however, this feedback loop runs out of control and can actually cause a panic attack. Calibrate her state closely at this time as any other emotions ongoing in her psyche can hitch a ride on the loop, and some girls can go really crazy when this happens. We're running a pure attraction loop and nothing else here so be careful what you're doing.

 We count off our third finger, look her in the eye, pause, and then say......

*""The third thing is you make lots of very confident eye contact""*.

Why? Because very attractive girls are very adept at avoiding eye contact with random guys who constantly try to make it with them. If they didn't, then they would have no end of loser types she has no interest in approaching her and wasting her time.

 The only guys she **does* make eye contact with, are guys she is interested in or attracted to.
 You've induced a state of attraction in her as she will now adopt that behaviour with you. The body is saying to the brain *""I'm making a great deal of eye contact with this guy""* so her mind says *""Ok that must mean I am attracted to him, so make more of the same""* and the feedback loop continues.

The reasons she adopts the behaviour are.

1/ She's in validation mode with you as her sexual rival is stealing her thunder; she wants it back and if eye contact is an ace up her sleeve, then so be it.

2/ She's in the final stage of a *""yes set"".*

3/ Do you remember the bit about *""trancewords""* earlier? Trancewords are words (usually adjectives) based on a person's sense of values. These  values are an actual part of someones identity at their most powerful. When she's stating her case for being more attractive/desirable than her rival she's using what she considers her main advantages over her.

 They could be: *""I'm more passionate"", ""classy"", ""sophisticated"", ""deep"", ""seductive""* etc.

 So the final push to get this behaviour through to her limbic brain is to utilise a value which has already been ""preapproved"" by her unconscious as being important to her. This is a technique known as *""tailgating""*. You take a value very close to another person's belief model, link it to the value/behaviour you wish to induce and the very association of the latter to the former stamps the signal **approved for access to limbic brain** to the package as a whole. Into her mind it goes to be unwrapped back into its two separate values once it's arrives.
 
Machiavellian? Totally. Manipulative? Absolutely.
 
 So....For the final push... with a slight nod (our earlier state anchor) we say...

*""You make very confident (insert trance word here) eye contact""*.


**Step 5: Welcome To My Frame**

 This stage is the stage to drop her totally out of her frame and into yours. You invite her into your territory. One of the remits of an alpha male in the entire animal kingdom is that they have their own territory. In this case, it would either be where you were originally stood if you're on your own, or back to your wingmen/wingman if you're in a group. By doing so you're demonstrating territorial, attraction generating cues at the very deepest parts of her limbic mind. That's the place (amygdala) where the values ""Fight, Feed, Fuck"" reside.

 This is deep core and the place you want to be.

**Step 6: How The World Is**

 If you're on your own, then project the emotional behaviour and frame that's she's a plate that you're very fond of (mentally not verbally) and run with that, with the odd unpredictable intercession (this refractionates but also loads up her cognitive buffer to keep the unconscious highways clear).

 If you're with your buddies then brief them before the approach on what to do when you bring the girl over. A good first thing for one of them to say is.

*""Are we staying or are we going?""*

 By doing this you indicate to her that you're the leader of your group (the alpha) but also imply a *""scarcity""* mindset in her so she will infer that you may actually be leaving (after all this chemistry!) and make her invest more. 

 You of course reply...

*""I haven't decided yet""*

 The mindset your group should now operate on, is as if she's a girlfriend you've been dating a while, but they've just met her. The group frame that this is the reality in question will permeate unconsciously and eliminate any residual frame she has (people drop into the strongest frame they're interacting with 95% of the time).

 No doubt the buddies will be looking for a piece of the action too, in which case ask her a female opinion on something then get her to invite one of her friends over to back her up. Now her group is splitting, some of your guys can go over and chat to the remaining ones. Top R cluster girl is your best bet here for ease of entry.

 After that is up to you, but the goal you want is to separate and isolate all the girls into groups of two (two girls-two wingmen) then run with it, with the end goal of bouncing in pairs to the next venue, but keep your frame tight at all times.

**End Note**

The most important thing about this method is YOU. In all human interactions, people send out what could be called *""reality pings""* like a submarine's sonar. These *""pings""* detect the frame of an ongoing interaction and who's going to drop into whose frame. The pings happen on an unconscious level and give an emotional valence to the frame at hand. Most people know about body language communication at a meta level, but below that there are tiny nuances in behaviour and physiology called *""BMIRs"". This stands for *Behavioural Manifestations Of Internal Representations""*.

 BMIR's are impossible to consciously fake and also very difficult consciously to detect. They just give us a gut feeling about someone (although the American secret service does train its agents using some BMIRs called ""Facial Action Cues"" [Micro gestures of the face which last only 300 milliseconds] developed by a guy called Paul Ekman so it can be done.

Alas we don't have access to this level of training but there is a fast track method.

 Genuinely believing your TRP frame and knowing 100% that the method will work. When you do that your BMIRs are a 100% reflections of your intentions and mental frame. The woman gets the ""feelz"" about you on an unconscious level. Her ""reality pings"" are mapping your psyche and getting the thumbs up (it's based on the ""limbic resonance"" I covered earlier). Hypnotists utilise the concept by what's called ""going first"". They adopt the emotion they wish their subject to have, the subject picks up the BMIRs of the emotion, their mirror neurons inject it into their own ""global-workspace"" and they feel the emotion themselves.

Remember though: In field is chaos at the best of times with people coming in and out of set and a great deal of distractions (Mobile phones!) but the greater the integrity of your frame (your force field) the less effect these things will have.

**TL;DR** Look up the bit about foot pointing. It's the matrix unveiled of attraction intentions.

I think it's partly this guy's fault for being a doormat. A list of all the things he did for her:

>He would always offer a helping hand, or would listen. We'd have conversations on skype, and he'd always be supportive and offer friendly advice. At work, he was really flexible with his shifts and would always rearrange to cover mine. For example, if I couldn't make a shift on a certain day, and would prefer another day, he would always gladly swap with me. He was always friendly about it. When I was moving apartments a couple months ago, he helped me move my stuff. When I didn't have my car for about two weeks, he drove me to work and home every day. He was an incredibly good friend and I was really thankful to have someone like him around.

>And he was also incredibly emotionally supportive, whenever I'd talk about my issues with friends or family, he'd listen. I've had depression and anxiety in the past, I take meds for it, and it comes back every now and again. I have a lot of personal worries, fears and issues, and he's always ready to listen and be supportive.

He asks her out and of course she says no. Surprisingly he doesn't just become an orbiter and keep doing nice things for her, instead he moves on which annoys her:

>Then over the next few days I noticed things were a bit different. He would still talk to me, chit chat occasionally, smile, say Hi. But he wasn't as receptive to conversations with me any more. On skype when we'd talk, he'd take longer to respond, and seems always uninterested and giving one word responses.
With work, he's no longer swapping any shifts with me. He says he can't manage the time, and he's also on a busy work and life schedule that he can't always move things around. 

>I'm moving apartments again in a months time, and I asked if he'd be ready to help me move again like last time, he said probably not and that he's too busy.

He's not giving her undivided attention and doing her favors all the time so what's her reaction?

>Now suddenly, its almost like he's an asshole.

>Did I make friends with a ""nice guy""? Was he really just an asshole all along only pretending to be nice to get in my pants?

Lesson: So if a guy doesn't give you undivided attention and time, he's an asshole.


Best comment:

>Yeah, you knew him for 8 months OP. He was never really your ""friend"" as he viewed you as a potential love interest. You shut him now, now he's protecting himself by creating distance and finding other girls to prioritize for dating.

>You are not entitled to preferential treatment. You are not dating him. You are not sleeping with him. He's just a dude and now he has other priorities. You don't get the benefit of boyfriend-like behavior from someone you will only accept platonic friendship with.

1048,4qsfv7,"Ever go up to a woman on an approach and say, ""Hey, I saw you and I just want to talk""?

Here's some truth to brand into your flesh:

**Women don't want to just talk to men.**

They want to fuck, go on an adventure, be told what to do, get into a dangerous situation, start some shit, fuck up someone's day, save the world, ride on a motorcycle, see a movie, dance, sell shit on Etsy, cheat, stab you, eat mayonnaise, and run from a dinosaur.

But never be fooled into ever think a woman ever wants to *just talk*, ever. 

She has an agenda. You have an agenda. 

Either you're working toward hers or you're working toward your own. There is no middle ground.

So when a woman shows middling or low interest, you've picked a mountain to climb. You'll climb it her way in her time with small reward and with no respect from her. You'll sacrifice time, energy, and focus, as well as inflating the value of what little payment you'll receive for the trouble - so that at the end, you must also deal with the effects of having catered to self-delusion. This means emotional fallout, time for getting your shit back together, retooling, and rebuilding. You've fucked yourself.

When a woman shows intense and vested interest, you've already won. You can have whatever you want. You can have it now. She will eagerly give you as much as you can handle and more. You've claimed a gift that was yours since birth. By acknowledging and fulfilling her desire to fulfill your desires - without hesitation, without pussyfooting around, with confidence and a smile on your face - you've not done anything amazing. You've simply had a normal sexual interaction between a masculine male and a feminine female. It is an interaction that not many people understand anymore but that everyone craves.

To achieve this end, value quantity of women over quality. This is old hat to many of you, but newbies take note. There's an epiphany waiting for you, that moment when you realize a woman you've known for 30 seconds is willing to do more for you than that girl you chased for 6 years.

**Corollary**: Any woman you interact with for a long amount of time in a non-sexual manner (who isn't already head over heels for you), is not a woman you will ever sleep with. 


------------------------------------------------------------

Here's the math:

You're more likely to get open eager honest sexuality from a woman within minutes of meeting you than you are in 3 years of dancing around the subject. Be up front, be honest, and in a quick few seconds she'll tell you with words or body language all that you need to know about who is likely to get what, when, and how (the politics of getting your dick wet). That's minutes invested rather than years wasted.

To do that, stop masturbating and do something extremely intense daily. I know we say ""lifting."" It's a wonderful go-to and will open all new dimensions in your life but to be honest, anything shamelessly and no-fucks intense will work. A sport. A competition. A gig. Anything that becomes something more than the sum of its parts and that requires focused balls-on-fire intensity - do that thing every day.

When you're raging and intense and focused, you become a black hole of Fuck that women fall into naturally. You want them. You can't stop yourself, and women are walking sex toys to a man who can't stop himself.

If you've been jacking off a lot and dispersed your energy and middled your life by avoiding intensity, extreme action, and excitement, you will be static and background noise to anyone you meet.

So if you've been going out after 3 wanks to try to psych yourself up to talk to that girl who maybe kind of likes you, you've fucked yourself. She'll smell your ""kind of"" interest, return a ""kind of"" interest with just enough hope to keep you on the leash. You will use the leash later to hang yourself.

If you go out after a week of not cumming, women will look at you from across the room with hopeful and begging eyes. They will say things to you and not know why. They will agree to do the kinkiest most fucked up shit because they can see in your eyes that you *want it so goddamn badly*. They will feel your leadership and use all your commands as refreshing and simplifying direction in their too-many-choices what-am-I-doing pointless lives.

And they absolutely, certainly, posi-fucking-tively won't just want to talk.

[**TL;DR: Animated Video Post**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l96-rIqWeYU&)

It’s easy to understand why people exercise their bodies. Your physical appearance is observed every day when you look in the mirror. Failure to take care of the body has obvious repercussions. The mind is different. Unlike the body, maintenance failure is not as obvious. So why would one wish to expand their mind in the first place?

Expanding your mind allows you to have a more comprehensive understanding of reality, which in turn better equips you with the resources you will need to achieve your goals and live a happier life. Knowledge is potential power, and potential power is better than having no power at all. Simply put, you will have more tools and be more informed which will allow you to make better decisions.


##**1. Hang out with insightful people**##
The easiest way to become more insightful is to hang around insightful people. You become like the people with whom you surround yourself. You might have noticed that overweight parents tend to have overweight kids, or that athletic parents tend to have athletic kids. In many cases, the people with whom we often associate with are responsible for many of the beliefs and values that we uphold.

If the most insightful things your friends have to say have to do with ‘Game of Thrones’  fan theories, perhaps it’s time you start associating yourself with new people.  You need to hang out with people that will give you new perspectives and make you contemplate higher quality thoughts. You don’t have to get rid of your old friends, just find some new ones.

There has never been an easier time to find insightful people. Through the powers of the internet, you can find your clan with a simple Google search. These people tend to hang out in niche forums or in dedicated Facebook groups. If you really want to find them, you will!

##**2. Meditate**##

Meditation has been practiced in the East for thousands of years. The exercise is starting to gain more popularity in the West due to scientific backing and general open-mindedness.

There are many benefits that stem from meditation; some are more obvious than others. However, these benefits only become evident after you have made meditation a daily practice in your life. Just like in the gym you cannot expect to see a huge transformation in one week.

Some benefits include:

* Increased ability to focus
* Increased emotional stability
* Reduced stress
* Increased Gray Matter in the Brain [1]
 

Meditation allows you to observe your thoughts and choose which ones to follow. You will no longer be run by impulse. Consequently, you will become better at decision making. Meditation leads to the development of ‘meta-awareness’, which means being aware of your own awareness. Enhanced meta-awareness allows you to step outside yourself and to judge your actions as if you were an observer. This ability is critical for those who wish to expand their minds. In the pursuit of knowledge, one will be forced with the task of challenging their presumed beliefs and thought patterns. That is why meditation is essential.

**Tools for meditation:**

* Headspace app
* Guided Mediation videos on YouTube 

##**3. Listen to Audiobooks and Podcasts**##

If you are serious about expanding your mind, you will be an adherent of the ‘Kaizen’ philosophy. It’s Japanese for ‘continuous improvement’. We all have the same twenty-four hours in a day, but what separates us is how we spend that time.

You can learn almost anything with audiobooks and podcasts. You can download new information to your brain whilst doing everyday activities. I, personally, can get through and audiobook easily within 2-3 days. If I am consistent, that’s 2 books a week and over 100 books a year. Can you imagine how different your mind will be if you went through 100 books a year? You don’t even need to read that many books for your mind and perspectives to shift. Even 30 books is more than 90% of people would complete. Here are some activities you can do whilst listening to audiobooks:

* Commuting to work
* Vacuuming the house
* Cleaning your car
* Cleaning your dishes
* Walking the dog

There are plenty of opportunities throughout the day that will arise in which you can slip in an audiobook.

Podcasts are also good and have gained huge popularity over the past few years. The advantage of listening to a podcast is that they can cover specific topics that are normally difficult to research. Podcasts are a goldmine, and just like audiobooks can have the same influence on your mind.

**Tools for Audio:**

* Audible
* Itunes Podcasts (contains over 250,000 different stations)
* Soundcloud (contains amateur podcasts)
* YouTube 

##**4. Read Biographies**##

Imagine if you could sit down with some of the most influential people in history, and hear them tell you their life stories. Imagine if you could learn the lessons they have learned, or discover certain insights that they had. Well, this is possible with the aid of biographies, and more specifically autobiographies. You might never get a chance to talk to these people, but you can absorb their words. Biographies are incredibly useful in regards to expanding your mind because they allow you to consider different contexts.

The best thing about biographies is that they distill many of the lessons that would have been learned over a lifetime.  You will not receive the same amount of insight as the person who experienced the events, but you will gain knowledge.

You might never become a boxing legend, or blow hundreds of millions of dollars, but you can learn the lessons from Mike Tyson’s biography. You might not be a president who spent twenty-seven years in prison, but Nelson Mandela’s biography might have something to say about it. You didn’t win the Mr. Olympia, and you weren’t the terminator or governator. But Arnold Schwarzenegger was, and he wrote all about it.

You get the picture; there are many life lessons to be learned through reading biographies! So what are you waiting for?

**Tools for Biographies**

* Goodreads (Find ratings and top lists)
* Total Recall (Arnold Schwarzenegger’s biography, a personal favourite)
* Long Walk To Freedom  (Nelson Mandela’s biography, another favourite)

##**5. Watch Documentaries**##

I remember when I was a young man. I used to spend many hours a day watching documentaries. My favourite documentaries were ones that dealt with: Astronomy, Quantum Physics, classical physics, war history, wildlife, and crime investigation. I stopped the habit after the age of sixteen.  Last year during my Mechanical Engineering course I was tasked with choosing an elective subject. I decided to choose Astronomy because of my prior interest in the subject. To my surprise, much of the content discussed in the lectures, I had already learned as a teenager through documentaries! Topics such as: gravitational waves, black hole event horizons, the moons of Jupiter, supernova, and nebula formation, as well as the expanding universe seemed like common knowledge to me. Long story short, I ended up getting a high distinction for the class. I didn’t get the mark because of natural intelligence; instead I got it through the documentaries that I had enjoyed as a teenager.

Documentaries are a fun means to expand your mind, especially during your downtime! The good thing about them is that they don’t seem like work. Many people can’t stand reading because to them it seems like work, it reminds them of school. Documentaries offer an alternative to the usual means of education, and you can find some good quality information in them as well. You can watch a range of documentaries on YouTube as well as a number of online websites for free. Do not ignore this medium; I try to watch one every couple of days.

**Tools for documentaries**

* topdocumentaryfilms.com (watch documentaries for free)
* YouTube Playlists ( many free documentaries )
* IMBb Highest rated documentaries (a useful list)

##**6. Read Philosophy**##

Reading philosophy is easily one of the best ways to expand your mind. Philosophy is derived from Greek and means ‘love of wisdom’. If you love wisdom you will not ignore philosophy. Philosophy challenges you to question many things in your life through the use of reason. The capacity to reason is one of the special human endowments that distinguishes us from animals. If you wish to expand your mind, you must learn to reason and use critical thinking to gain clarity. Philosophical inquiry can lead you to entertain deeper thoughts than you have ever imagined. You might find yourself asking questions such as:

1. Is it worse to fail at something or never attempt it in the first place?
2. If I could change one thing about the world, what would it be?
3. To what extent do we shape our own destinies, and how much is down to fate?
4. Does nature shape our personalities more than nurture?
5. Should people care more about doing the right thing, or doing things right?
6. What single piece of advice should we offer to a newborn infant?
7. Where is the line between insanity and creativity?
8. What is true happiness?

Luckily for us, we can also read the ideas and conclusions made by some of the greatest thinkers who have ever lived. We can read philosophy from both the East and the West in order to form our own personal world view. I highly recommend you read philosophy if you are serious about expanding your mind.

**Tools for philosophy:**

* Philosophy in minutes (introductory book that summarises key concepts)
* The pig that wants to be eaten (fun philosophical conundrums)
* The Republic (classic text by Plato)
* Meditations (classic text by Marcus Aurelius)
* School of life Philosophy (a YouTube crash course in philosophy)

##**7. Learn a new language**##

Learning a new language is an extreme workout for the brain, it’s like running a couple of marathons and competing in a strongman competition straight after. Language is complex, and in often shapes how we see the world. Learning a new language forces you to learn new syntax structures, and a completely new vocabulary and way of describing the world. Research has shown people who are multilingual often:

* have higher general intelligence 
* are better at planning, prioritizing, and decision-making 
* have better focus, concentration and attention 
* have better memory and memorization skills, including better working memory 
* exhibit mental flexibility 

There are just so many benefits to learning a new language, and as society becomes more globalised you might be forced to learn a new one.

**Tools for language learning:**

openculture.com (free language lessons)
busuu.com (language lessons)

##**8. Learn programming**##

Programming, much like learning a new language, can be incredibly taxing on the brain. Steve Jobs famously said,

>“Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer… because it teaches you how to think.”

Programming requires a structured and logical way to thinking, much like mathematics. Programming is advanced program solving that requires you to break down complicated problems into smaller manageable pieces that can be tackled. This structured way of thinking can then be applied to real-world scenarios. Good programmers are good problem solvers, and as the world becomes more technologically advanced, individuals with these skills will be rewarded greatly. Programming also requires incredible persistence as well as creativity. This is because small errors in a line of code can ruin the functionality of the end product.  Programming develops grit due to the persistence needed for it. It has been said that a young Bill Gates (Before his billionaire days) would often code for twelve hours straight. Gates would often fall asleep on the keyboard, wake up and continue his coding.

Programming has never been easier to learn as there are many of online resources and communities that can help you. I personally like to use codeacademy.com as you can learn a range of languages from HTML to C++. Go and give coding a try!

**Tools for programming:**

* Codeacademy.com (learn to code online for free)
* MIT ‘Introduction to Computer Science and Programming’ (free online course)
* Codeschool.com  (paid courses)
* Khan Academy ‘Computer Programming’ (free online course)

##**The Bottom Line**##

Expanding your mind is not rocket science. There is one common denominator between everything that I have listed. Everything challenges your mind in some way. Anything can be used as a tool to expand your mind, as long as it involves you learning something new. This list is by no means exhaustive; there are many things that I have omitted for example:

playing chess or any other strategy game
learning a new musical instrument
learning cognitive biases and heuristics
building up your memory
It’s up to you to figure out which tools you will use. I hope this article has been of value to you. Go out there and expand your mind!

1050,9lcyio,"As I mentioned, we are making the appeal process completely open because we believe there wouldn't be fair play if it was behind closed doors. Below is our appeal to the admin:

---

First, I would like to tell you that we’ve posted this entire appeal publicly and plan to post your replies as well. We strongly believe this system you have set up to be a kangaroo court and have evidence to support this notion. If you want to prove to us that you are going to treat this appeals process fairly then we welcome your responses to the contrary.

In your message to us regarding our quarantine, you offer an appeals process:

> In this case the quarantine was applied for the high degree of misogyny present in this subreddit.
>To be removed from quarantine, you may present an appeal here. The appeal should include a detailed accounting of changes to community moderation practices. (Appropriate changes may vary from community to community and could include techniques such as adding more moderators, replacing certain moderators, creating new rules, employing more aggressive auto-moderation tools, adjusting community styling, etc.) The appeal should also offer evidence of sustained, consistent enforcement of these changes over a period of at least one month, demonstrating meaningful community transformation.

You’ve presented us with no evidence for your accusation, simply an assertion of misogyny. And yet your prescription is to change and modify this undocumented problem, a very thinly veiled setup for failure. You know full well we cannot address concerns that have not been raised - Which makes this a kangaroo court by definition.

Your appeals process does not offer an opportunity to claim innocence, instead placing guilt into the default terms of appeal. 

But we reject your charges.

Our moderation team has gone to great length to ensure our members follow reddit’s terms of service. We see no terms in the [content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/) that we have violated. And yet you allege we have broken this unwritten policy. How is it that you expect moderators and community to follow such rules is beyond me. Perhaps it is because you prefer to keep all communities in the dark about the unwritten rules. Keep everybody guilty of some crime, and selectively enforce it upon those you disagree with.

> “Show me the man, I’ll show you the crime.” — Lavrenti Beria, secret police chief under Stalin

To me, this seems like an immeasurably bad way to run a social media site which depends on its users for long-term survival. Perhaps it’s not in your interest to ensure Reddit stays around. Maybe you’re using censorship and quarantines as a means to redirect discussion into the direction you prefer. Maybe you’re trying to sway an election? I don’t know, that’s above my pay grade.


Misogyny is a very nebulous term, one that I disagree with heartily. Many use it in places where somebody has been critical of women, but does that meet the criteria of hate? I think that’s a very high bar to meet. One way we can test your definition of misogyny is simply to see how you’ve applied these standards site-wide.


Let’s say I started a subreddit with a mission statement:


>R/UpsetFemales is a subreddit for mocking reddit's large, vocal, and hypocritical female population.

>Women have a right to dignity and to exist, but they don't have a right to be upset and uncomfortable whenever they're confronted with sexism issues.

Would this meet your definition of misogyny? 


Well, substitute the words “female” and “women” with white people and you’ve got yourself the sub /r/fragilewhiteredditor. And for some reason they’re not quarantined.


Now I’m sure you guys understand the implications of picking and choosing what completely legal ideas and topics are okay to discuss on reddit. When you choose to block off /r/theredpill and post an endorsement to your point of view (Michel Kimmel), you’re tacitly endorsing the points of view you’ve chosen not to censor – especially the ones that align with Michael Kimmel.


Hatred (by your definition) is okay as long as the target is against white people.


What about towards men? Here are some lovely sentiments floating around reddit that the reddit admin tacitly endorses by not censoring or quarantining:

 [“Sorry you're going through this. It's the patriarchy: men think they own women. That is a flat out fact.”]( http://archive.is/XHCdk)

 [“sorry boys but its true and yall need to be taught not to rape. You are a cancer on society.”]( http://archive.is/GpzTw)

 [“I still see so many people say that ""All men are rapists"" This is a factually accurate statement expressing that men are socialized as both heterosexual and weapons against women and so typically have sex relationships that are not consensual in a fully self-actualized sense.”]( http://archive.is/e78kL)

[“I’m a misandrist, but I don’t want to be”](http://archive.is/N2lXY)

So it is clear, you tacitly endorse these positions if they are not quarantined as well.


To make matters worse, when you quarantined us, you put up a message directing our users to  Stony Brook University Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities whose executive director is Michael Kimmel.  The same Michael Kimmel who [denies male abuse victims](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9jypns/300000_subscribers_the_reddit_administration/). I see since then you’ve had the presence of mind to remove it- but without so much as an apology to our community of men who had to witness this. I would absolutely hate to know that the well being of abuse victims on /r/theredpill have been affected, or worse- hurt, by this event.


What would happen if the admin posted a message at the top of TWOX claiming that women’s abuse isn’t nearly as high as reported and that men’s abuse was much worse? Well, I’m pretty sure you’d call that misogyny.


So what’s it called when you do it to men? (It’s called misandry.)





We know the quarantine process isn’t simply about keeping the front page clear of controversial topics. There’s literal [shit porn]( https://old.reddit.com/r/scatporn), [women getting pissed on](https://old.reddit.com/r/watersports/), and [detailed rape fantasies](https://old.reddit.com/r/rapefantasies/) which have gotten the pass from your administration. Looks like you guys just love shit, piss, and rape. 

Meanwhile the content on TRP has helped thousands (if not more) of men find an identity and the strength needed to get back on the horse after terrible events like breakups, divorces, or false rape accusations. For some, they believe TRP literally [saved](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1prsqs/trp_knowledge_saved_my_life/) [their](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2dhqoh/trp_saved_my_life/) [lives]( https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5daq79/red_pill_saved_my_life/). Some of whom could easily have ended up [dead](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4il5of/close_friend_committed_suicide_after_falling/).

Look, you could have asked us to remove ourselves from /r/all, and we would have complied. But the quarantine makes things much worse. Mobile users see a message that we’ve gone private, causing our modmail to get literally hundreds of messages asking for access, completely halting actual mod functions. Members who have already subscribed are having a hard time finding us. It is clear that your goal with quarantine was to put as much into place as possible to make us fail, all while not actually pulling the trigger on an outright ban, because you know full well we keep the user base in check and do not allow rule breaking.


But I’m willing to give you guys the benefit of the doubt. Let’s say all of my well documented and evidenced accusations are simply wrong. Let’s say you really are just trying to make reddit a nice beige happy-land for new users and advertisers, and your goal was not to tacitly endorse all the hatred on the internet that you have chosen not to censor. I am willing to propose a compromise.


Remove the quarantine, and we will select the option to prevent being seen from /r/all. This has a lot of benefits. First of all, you won’t be tacitly endorsing every bit of hate on reddit because you’re no longer picking sides. But most importantly, your users will see the admin team actually applies rules in a balanced and fair manner, gaining you a level of respect that, let’s face it, Ellen Pao did a good job eroding.


We would be happy to comply with reasonable requests that help you with your advertisers and future IPO. We aren’t your enemy. The way you’ve gone about this was a big mistake and I think we can both agree on that. Let’s work together to move past this event and get the admin and users back on the same side for the benefit of reddit.
",1050,4.0,0.24799999594688416,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"
1051,8pm17w,"I met this girl in the library. English, brunette, small and very cute. Pretty face.
It's exam time and everyone's been pulling all nighters or staying up late. We were in a computer room that was pretty empty, and she kept glancing over. I saw that we were studying the same thing.

We 'studied' like that for a while but actually I was just on reddit and she was playing some kind of RPG on her mobile. It was hot.

So I walked over because she was cute as hell and approach anxiety doesn't even register anymore and as soon as she saw me her eyes lit up and then she knocked her coffee over her computer keyboard. Lol.

We studied together for a while, (we had taken the same module,) answered some exam questions, flirted quite heavily and then decided to head off because it was late. She was very cute and smiley and seemed to be enjoying herself a lot.

It was like 2am or something, she lived in the halls close by, I lived far away. I decided to walk her back to her halls, because, you know, it was 2am. She was happy about it.

We walk in the night and she brags to me about how her IQ is 170 and she's in mensa and I'm like ""whowh this girl is into me huh.""

I see her off at the front gates and then go to head home, but not wanting to pass up a sure thing, I say to her ""we should study together again, that was fun"".

She gives me her number eagerly.
___________________________

Skip to a few days later. 

I wake around 1pm to a headache, ass taste and a dry throat. Pulled an all nighter for an exam the day before and my recovery sleep seemed to have run over deep into the next day. Oops. Gotta make up for that sleep debt I guess.

The first thing I do is drink some water, take a piss, brush my damn teeth and then check my phone and see the message;

""Omw""

Oh it's the girl.

She's on her way.

On her way where?

Shit, yeah. We were 'hanging out' today. Supposed to meet at 1.30.

I check the time. Shit.

I am not ready. And I will be late.

How long can I make her wait?... Well this is directly correlated to the attractiveness of the girl. 

In this case, not very long.

I get a move on.

The house is a tip, and I anticipate maybe possibly potentially hopefully fucking this girl after, so I can't bring her back to a shithole can I?

I begin cleaning the house: airing out the smoke, beer cans, food wrappers, trading cards. Soon I have a substantial rubbish bag and am not gonna let it stink up the flat. I put on my trusty slippers, put the door on latch and head downstairs.

I head out the main downstairs door and deposit the rubbish bag in the bin and attempt to re-enter through the front door.

But I've only gone and done it haven't I.

I've locked myself out.
__________________________________________

The first thing I did was buzz the neighbours. No need to panic yet. It's the downstairs front door that's locked, the door to my flat is on latch. They only need to buzz me in and I have access.

But no one was answering. I only have 2 neighbours, the cute Asian girl that lives across from me, and a European couple above. Whenever I bring over screamers they try to match us. It's pretty fun actually.

Poor asian girl though...

Anyway she wasn't answering. And neither was the couple. Well fuck they were probably at work. Of course. Real adults have real jobs and don't sleep in until 1pm to 'study'.

I weigh up my options and variables.

I should be at the library with this girl in 20 mins.

I am, quite literally, in the clothes I slept in. Luckily for me, that entails a thick hoodie and sweats, because I save money on heating and pyjamas are for fags.

Oh and my slippers of course. However, no phone, no keys, no wallet. No current way to enter the house.

I consider scaling the building, I'm a climber... but no parkour maniac. And I don't think I was stupid enough to leave any windows open.

Fuck. I realise that this date isn't gonna happen. I'm stuck outside, completely technologically naked, with no way to contact anyone.

Missing phone anxiety begins to creep in. 

Gonna have to flake on the girl, cos I'm a damn idiot and locked myself out of the flat. A silent flake too... harsh.

Oh well. She'll probably like me more after anyway.
________________________________________________
So I decide the smartest thing to do is wait for my neighbours to get back.

Which will probably be like 6 or 7 right? That's when normal people finish their normal jobs right?

Well until then I guess I just gotta kill time.

A few years ago, I woulda stressed about a situation like this, really just got stupidly anxious. But I've read Solzhenitsyn... this... this is no big deal at all. Pretty funny actually. 

Lets make the most of it.

So I wonder down the high street in my slippers, and get looks from the people on the street. I probably look like a mess, unshowered and unshaven and in my sweats; but then I see my reflection in a shop window and I've got that whole just woke up bed-head grizzled college boy stoner look going on and I marvel for the 1000th time at how attractive I am. Thank god for lifting.

The slippers flop on the pavement, they probably will not last the day if I'm gonna be walking around. But oh well. I remember buying these slippers. Only a few weeks ago. I was in a store and I spotted them and immediately felt this ethereal feeling like they were important somehow and I needed them. The slippers damn called to me. So I bought em.

Interesting. Now I know why. Morphic Resonance after all. Or maybe just very good slipper marketing.

I sit on a bench by the river and watch the water. It's a cold day. I feel naked and unplugged, and for the first time, actually feel good about it. I had no phone or money, no internet connection, no dopamine inducing distractions, and I was alone with my thoughts and the cold air. A sudden weight lifted from the top of my head. It felt like I'd just taken a small dose of... something....

It was freeing. I realised it was going to be one of those days. I haven't had one of these in a while, and I cherish them.
_____________________________________________________
It now has to be past the time when I was supposed to meet the girl but I have no real way to tell. I meditate for a while cos the air feels good on my face and then people-watch in the park and pet a dog. I begin listing off places to visit and planning out how I'll spend the next 5 or so hours until my neighbours get back.

It's as I am walking up the highstreet that I find what I thought was an extinct species of store.

An internet cafe.

An oasis.

Shit. Pass the tourniquet I have access again.

He looks at me. ""Ok. Number 5"".

Thanks bro.

I get on facebook and its 2:05 and i notice she hasnt messaged me yet. Playing it cool. Nice.

I scroll reddit and memes for a while.

Then I have an idea.

I google the number of my estate agent. They should have a spare set of keys right? Paki bro let me use his phone to call them.

The lady on the other side didn't seem happy with my shit. They couldn't help me.

Plan foiled. Waiting for the neighbours it is then.

I scroll through trp for a while. The old hambeast next to me is watching some african music video and breathing very loudly through her mouth, and she's scrolling back and watching the same 10 seconds over and over. Has been doing it the whole time.

I finally get a ""?"" From the girl.

Nice. Still playing it cool.

I make her wait for 5 mins then hit her with the:

""cant come sorry""

She says ""why""

I start to think about what I should do. But I know immediately what I'm going to do. It's one of those days after all, and I want her along for the ride.

""you could come here though""

She waits a long time before saying ""where""

I message her the name of the nearest train station. She says ""why though?"" I tell her ""lol its a surprise "".

This was obviously too much for her to bear and she texted ""ok lol coming""

Wow that worked. Maybe I have her hooked already, or maybe she's just an adventurous one. Both options are great.

I didn't really have a plan for what happens next though. But who cares, I'll make it up as I go along.

Without my phone, or my wallet, I was entirely free to just drift with no responsibilities. It felt amazing.

Frankly, it felt like I was a kid again. Playing outside during summer.

I was suddenly very excited to see her.
___________________________________________
When she arrived at the station and saw me in my slippers she gave me the goofiest smile. I could see in her eyes that she knew immediately that it will be one of those days.

""I locked myself out"" I said.

""How?!?"" She's laughing.

So I tell her the story, as we walk around town. I'm very self conscious that my breath might be bad due to the fact I actually haven't eaten anything yet, but am also thankful I am OCD about brushing my teeth as soon as I wake up.

I didn't really think about gaming her at all, I didn't analyse anything or hyperfocus on my actions. I just kinda went with it. It was fun, I was completely in the moment and just ran around the town and played with her, like a boy dog with a girl dog following him around.
It helps that she wasn't shit testing me or anything bitchy like that, made it so easy and she happily bounced along like a lil' sidekick.

Well we try my flat again but my neighbours still aren't in, obviously, so we sit on the doorstep. I ask her if she wants to study. So we study on the doorstep for a while.

""Wait when do you have to be home?"" I ask her.

""Uh, anytime."" She smiles back.

""Cos I have no idea how long it will be till my neighbours get back. You don't have to wait with me the whole time you know""

""No I like it this is fun""

Wow. What a great feeling. When a pretty girl genuinely wants your company.
______________________________________

We chat for a while and quiz each other on metabolic pathways and then decide to wander again.

I climb a tree and then we talk about our families. I feel like a kid hanging out with his middle school girlfriend after school.

Eventually we spot a McDonalds.

So we go in. I haven't had breakfast, or eaten in hours. Fuck if I'm losing gains.

""So you know I don't have my wallet right?""

So she gets us a chicken nugget sharebox and sprites and we blow the straw packets at each other. Then we have ice cream.

We wonder by the park for a bit and it's getting colder so we head to a sports department store and check out all the cool bikes and skiing and climbing gear and I tell her I'll take her bouldering some time and she's down.

We leave and I reveal I've stolen a tennis ball and she gets mad at me becuase stealing is bad and scolds me so I keep bouncing the ball at her until she backs off and laughs and we play catch and she cant throw for shit and its cute.

The whole time, everything felt right. Like we'd been friends for ages, and we were on an adventure together.

We hit up a supermarket because I'm getting hungry again and we buy ham and dark chocolate and tangerines, and a jar of pickles. I wanted to get salted pistachios and mentioned it but the pistachios were very expensive and she was paying so... This time though we had a security guard following us around. For good reason too, I was still traipsing around in my slippers, which were muddy and beginning to fall apart. Probably looked like we were on drugs.

She pays again and I mentally add the tab up in my head with the nuggets. As we leave the guard says to us ""scuse me did ya pay for those"" and I say ""why would we steal pickles mate"" and she waves the receipt at him and gives him that Stacey disgust sneer that we've all sadly been on the receiving end of. It was astounding watching the pretty girl face morph into ultimate bitch putdown mode. There are probably betas in her life who only ever know her as this.

But hey I get to experience the cute, dorky side of her, and I'm loving it.

______________

We leave the supermarket and she reveals that she actually stole the pistachios and hid them in her purse and I hug her cos I'm proud and squeeze her ass and then we eat our meal in the park.

After the meal we lay together on the grass for a while and I give the tennis ball to a dog that tried to steal our food and then we attempt the neighbours again but still nothing and its like 6pm and I'm starting to get a bit irked.

It's beginning to get cold now and I'm afraid the girl is getting bored of me and also that my neighbours might just have gone away for ever and I don't wanna have to call a locksmith but soon it will be late. I decide to take her to the one place in town I haven't taken her to yet.

Paki bro is cool again with us using the computers, and so we browse memes together for a while, and the hambeast is still there literally doing the same thing as before. She tells me about rick and morty but I don't really like rick and morty but I pretend its cool anyway cos why not and then I show her reddit and she doesn't really get it and then I tell her 9/11 was an inside job and we spend the next 2 hours arguing over conspiracy theories.

I make 4 journeys to check on the neighbours in the meantime and my slippers are broken and flapping at this point and its fucking almost 9pm and no one is home yet. I really don't want to have to do the lame and expensive option of getting a locksmith but its getting increasingly likely. What if my neighbours were just away? I hadn't heard them banging in a while tbh...

Everytime I get back to the cafe she is slouched there scrolling instagram and she hasn't left yet and its dark now and the cafe has got that dingy yellow light grimeyness to it and with the pretty bored girl sitting there and the ambience it looked like a damn Hopper painting and that snapshot remains imprinted in my mind. Really nice.

I tell her no one is stopping her from going home as it's getting late.

She says she feels bad for me and wants to see me get tucked in bed nice and warm.

Sweet

________________________

At 9 pm I break and realise my neighbours probably aren't coming back tonight and it was just my luck (or providence) that I got locked out today. I decide to go for the last resort and call up a locksmith using the girls phone. I'm bit grumpy about it but also got shit to do tomorrow.

>""I only have 1 door I'm locked out of how much and how long?""

The lady on the other side said £70. Reasonable. 40mins.... Sure.

But first I have to run it by the girl.

>""You're not broke are you?""

>""Why""

>""I need 70 for the locksmith""

>""Sure"" she says

>""Okay please come immediately"" I tell the lady.

We leave and I attempt to give the internet cafe guy £10 of her money as a gesture of thanks but he's not having it and seems more invested in the asian tv show he's watching anyway.

So we go to the ATM so she can withdraw the cash and then return to the doorstep to wait for the locksmith.

It seems locksmiths and drug dealers have a lot in common. They always seem to be '20 more minutes"".
__________________________

After 80 mins the girl starts yawning and I begin to shiver cos it's cold and she cuddles up to me. I call again and basically shout at the lady on the phone to hurry up and also to give me a discount. She says 10%. I say that's not enough and I wanted 20. She said 'ok ok'.

I can feel myself getting hot angry at the whole situation now but I catch myself cos I know its stupid and I don't wanna break frame in front of the girl.

So finally, after 90 mins the guy arrives and I think its gonna be a simple affair but nope, life ain't that easy.
___________________________
**Final Boss**

So this guy shows up and he's eyeing me up oddly and eyefucking the pretty girl. He asks what needs opening.

I show him the front door and the top latch lock that just needs to be picked or whatever, I actually have no idea how locksmiths operate but I'm sure he's had this a million times before.

He gives me a 'hmmm' and a 'haaa' and says ""well it looks like I'm gonna have to drill it""

That sounds expensive.

>  ""Drill it? Is there nothing else you can do?""
> 
>  ""No I'm gonna have to remove the lock and install a new one""
> 
>   ""Does that mean new keys and shit?""
> 
>   ""Yeah I'm afraid so""
> 
>   ""Hey man I don't wanna bother my neighbours just cos I'm an idiot, you sure there's no other way you can try?""
> 
>   ""No this happens all the time only way is to drill it out"" he seems pretty sure of himself.
> 
>   ""Nah dude I'm not gonna pay for that"".

It's got a bit tense because we both realise neither of us is willing to back down yet. The girl can feel the animosity between us but she seems to know her place and doesn't say anything.

The frame battle continues.

I weigh up my options. I need to get in. This guy wants to rob me. I could get a new locksmith, that means another 90 mins probably, and maybe another scumbag. Fuck that I want to get inside now.

Then I think back to one of the first lessons I learned when i stumbled across this subreddit.

**""Your greatest power as a man is your ability to walk away"".**

I smile.

> ""Okay dude cool I'm not gonna inconvenience my neighbours, will figure out how to get in tomorrow""

> I ask the girl ""hey, can we go back to your place tonight?

> She's surprised but says ""sure of course"".

> ""Cool that's sorted then, sorry dude I'm just a broke student you know haha""

I see the panic of a lost sale in his eyes, he realises that I'm not bluffing.

But I give him an opening. In truth, I actually want this damn door open. You must always give them an opening to backtrack, it helps them save face. 
> 
> ""Could you just give it one last look though just to make sure?""
> 
> ""You know what mate, let me try something"" he says, as he rummages in his van.

Of fucking course. You go for it *mate*. You try something *mate*.

Bastard.
_______________________________

So he grabs this long hook claw thingy and feeds it through the letter box and opens the door in 4 seconds flat and I wanna bash his fucking head in but mostly I'm just glad that we're finally inside and it's warm and also victory tastes sweet cos absolutely fuck this guy. Don't blame him that much tbh, most people are weak and agreeable and probably fall for this one all the fucking time, but that's still such an asshole way to do business. 

So she hands me the cash but I give her 20 back and she has a £5 note and so I give him the £55 (for 5 mins worth of work not bad bro) and he says

>""Its 70 mate""

I get a hot flash of anger. Wow. Round 2 it is.

>""Your boss gave me 20% off for being late""

>""I wasn't told anything about that"" he says.

>""Well she did""

He pauses for a moment. Still holding the money. I can feel the girl get more anxious. We're inside now and the silence makes the tension worse.

> I'm pissed. ""Whether she told you or not you still owe me a discount you were very late""

He smiles. It's a good shit eating smirk, ladies must like it.

>""Okay but its 56.""

This guy must be joking.

The hot anger cools into a shrewd sharp chill as I realise.

Fuck this guy. I know exactly what he's doing. If he's not gonna get his cash, he'll at least try and make me sperg out and break frame in front of the girl. Petty but effective, cant allow me to win too hard can he?

I give them both a smile. ""Do you have a pound babe?"" I ask her. She doesn't. So I go upstairs and grab a pound from my loose change. It feels great to be back in my home again. I also clean up a bit more and fabreeze. Lol.

Probably should not have left her downstairs alone with the asshole, but I get back down and he hasn't cucked me so I put the coin straight into his palm.

""Okay we're done you can go now""

He seems pleased with himself and leaves.

__________

We get upstairs and I put the radiators on, down a glass of water and stare at myself in the bathroom mirror for a while to try to dissipate the anger. Such a great day and one guy's gotta be an asshole and ruin it.

Then I realise that I don't have to think about it that way and actually I just smashed through a significant confrontation that I would have failed miserably years ago. This is the kind of shit Dads train you for and I never had a Dad but shit, I managed to do it. They say TRP is just for picking up women but honestly it's so much more; this place taught me how to hold frame and power-talk and navigate confrontations like this. Beforehand I would have been an agreeable pussy and bent over for the guy.

And the day had been fucking great too. A day disconnected from responsibilities and exams and social media. A day free of anxiety, where I could just flow in the moment and mess around with a cute girl like I did when I was a kid... And had I never even spoke to the girl, had I pussied out in that one pivotal moment in the library, this day would never have happened.

Always approach guys, you never know where the story with that girl will go, and pussying out kills the story before it even gets to start. Regret is always worse than rejection.

As I think about this I give myself shivers and am proud, and then smile in the mirror like a fucking psycho and scare myself.... but then realise its not that bad and I can smile when I'm proud if I want it's no big deal.

I enter the living room and she's taken off her coat and shoes and looks at me warmly and says ""you have a nice place"" and I say 'thanks' and then she immediately and very eagerly begins removing my clothes.

**Epilogue**
_________

The next morning we cook breakfast and I'm head chef and she's like my nurse handing me scalpels and shit and its fun to boss her around and she follows my instructions. Afterwards I walk her to the high street to see her off. At the ATM I withdraw all the money from the tab I racked up yesterday and pay it all back immediately. Then I kiss her off at the station.

I feel pretty darn great about myself and basically skip home and jump into bed and just take some time to process things now that I'm finally alone.

The whole of yesterday was amazing, and I learnt so much about myself. All it took was some damn disconnection from life for a while.

I consider trashing my phone and getting a brick. Could I make the leap? Probably a good fucking idea. We know now that Zuck is listening to everything we say, and I'm trying to avoid getting on more lists than the many I'm already on.

Then I think about the girl, and just how lovely and sweet she was to be around. It was like she energised and supported me, gave me the life and exuberance I was missing. I suddenly really wanted to see her again, and felt the first few hints of one-itis settle in... She was so nice and feminine and smart and loyal and had the whole girl next door ""would never cheat on u"" vibe going. Hey, if we were a couple this would be a great origin story to tell people... I wonder what our kids would look like...

I settle for going on facebook to look at her pictures and miss how pretty she is.

I click on her profile pic which is very demure and innocent and makes her look smart and then I see it instantly.

>""In a relationship with""

Lol. Why did I get my hopes up. What was I expecting.

AWALT after all.

I have my own subreddit. Link in my profile. ",1051,0.0,0.4390000104904175,"girl, feel, really, find, still, shit, male, always, leave, relationship"
1052,62zuwd,"I pretty much a daily smoker for the past 2 years. For most of this duration, I told myself I smoke to feel good. I also believed I smoked to get creative, be musical, and sometimes even social. No matter how bad it got, I saw that weed was a good influence on my life. 

But the fantasy came crashing down 2 weeks ago. I had begun to notice for the first time how my thoughts haunted me. It began when I noticed my thoughts actually snowball as my day goes on, growing more and more powerful, thinking of this and that, constantly fretting about the past or future. I didn't think much of it at first, having lived with this sort of mind for a long time now. But that day, I read a quote on Reddit that triggered a different response. 

**""Living in the past causes depression. Living in the future causes anxiety.""**

At that moment, I understood the reason behind my addiction to weed. I was using weed to stop thinking about the past and future and live in the moment. For when I smoke weed, I relax because nothing else matters but the *now*. 

From there, I knew what I had to do. I had to tackle my issue from the root cause. My thoughts were out of control, pushing me to anxiety and depression. So I searched for information and found the concept of **immersion**. Immersion is when you are completely into an experience that you think of nothing else as you experience it. For instance, video games with high immersion levels captivate you for hours on end. I found relaxation in video games because of my immersion. 

So I thought if I were to be immersed in what I am doing, regardless of what activity it is, I can be relaxed at all times! I can be the most comfortable person at any place in the world if I was truly immersed in the environment and people I interact with!

I found that millions of people were already practicing immersion in everyday life by meditating. So I sat down in my candlelit room and I said out loud, ""there is no past, no history, no future, only now. I am. I am."" as i began my session. I didn't time my session. I would stop meditating when my mind is clear from thoughts about the past and future. At first, i would catch myself throughout the day as my thoughts would spin out of control and just meditate. It didn't matter if I was outside or hanging with friends, I would close my eyes and repeat that line. Calmness would pass through my body, relaxing my face and body. Then I would carry on with whatever I was doing. 

On top of that, I found that exercise helped tremendously with calming my mind. Exercise in itself is an immersive experience. You're there, with your body, pushing it and pushing it like nothing in the world matters. And when you come out, your brain chemistry is pushing you towards positivity. I see the gym as another meditation room.

After all this, I've completely stopped relying on weed for relaxation. If I wasn't relaxed, I'd go to the gym or meditate. I became the most relaxed person at every venue I went to. It was to the point where I could sense who was anxious and who was calm.

Smoking itself feels different for me. I no longer think I am happier or more relaxed with weed. After all, I was already as relaxed as I can be. Merely, I would describe it as a different state of mind. 

I leave you with another quote: 

**""A man cannot control others if he cannot control himself""**

**TL;DR: OP stopped denying that he had an anxiety problem. OP accepted that his thoughts were controlling him. So OP practiced meditation and exercised daily to tackle the problem instead of smoking to delay it. Now OP does not smoke alone to escape anymore.

1053,9cwa9p,"I recently went to a family gathering where my 17 year old cousin gave me a crash course in Gen Z. (the jury is still out on the name). This is the post millennial generation. I don't generally like to package things into neat little boxes but for the sake of the post let's go with it.

She was showing me some ""huge"" boxing match between two YouTube ""celebrities"". Apparently YouTube and Instagram personalities are replacing film and music stars as the the big draw cards, welcome to the virtual takeover.

While she was showing me this whole boxing match saga we stumbled on to this video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mmIEZKWi3A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mmIEZKWi3A) ""Why Do Girls Dump Their Boyfriends?""

The video shows some young fella interviewing Gen Z girls on a popular nightlife street in the US. Being a millennial myself and having endured a large part of my generation driving feminism to the heights we see today, I was still somewhat surprised by the state of affairs. It's a jungle out there to say the least and I pity the horde of programmed Soyboys coming off societies production line, that have to co-exist with these Vag-Lords. I can only hope that one day they may stumble upon a Sub such as this to (reluctantly) liberate themselves from the tyranny of a gynocentric haven.

The video starts out with the Interviewer asking young ""Living my best life"" thots why girls dump their boyfriends. I think their inebriated state assists in the truth they spit when answering the question, but their answers point to a much larger, gloomier problem for young men growing up today.

The glaringly obvious thread that ran through most of the answers was how men have become needy bitches, and  woman just can't stand it. Ultimately the feminization of men as a whole.

In the intro one of the girls proudly boasts:

>*Her: Every guy I've broken up with has threatened to kill himself*

As if it's just another feather in her cap. This is a far cry from the prehistoric days where a woman losing a man was a tragedy, like she had just lost her meal ticket(because she had). Or the stereotype of a woman sobbing at the loss of her beau, but here we have poor Billyboy's employing the dramatic(typically feminine traits) in an obscene display of oneities. Threatening to trade his own life for a c-grade clam in an attempt to negotiate attraction. She looks truly moved.

The same girl later on goes on to complain that:

>Her: *I make em comfortable and they cheat on me  \*and then shakes her ass at the camera\**

It's truly a riddle as to why they struggle to settle with such a wholesome princess.

The next girl tells a tale of how she's dumped every boyfriend she's ever had with a snide look of accomplishment. She goes on to say the reason she dumped them:

>*Her: They were all way more obsessed with me than I was with them, It was gross.*  
>  
>I*nterviewer: They probably wanna share their feelings with you?*  
>  
>*Her: Yeah, it's like stop, I don't wanna hear that*

It seems our dames are more in tune with their sexual nature than ever, and why wouldn't they be, feminism has given them the platform to express it as freely as possible. Note the disgust a woman has for a low value man who hands himself over to a woman, she simply cannot harbor feelings for such a needy scrap of filth.

The BP notion of share your feelings and showing how much you care quite literally repels women. She goes on to say...

>*Her: I don't wanna see you all the time, maybe twice a week, don't be obsessed with me, thats disgusting. Let me go out, let me wear whatever the fuck I want.*  
>  
>*Interviewer: And If I happen to make out with someone..*  
>  
>*Her: Who cares, it was a slip up, shit happens.*

Translation, be my little bitch, get comfy in my frame, I'm gonna go shop at the meat market as much as I want and If a sausage happens to land in my mouth, well then oh well shit happens.

More concerning is the mentality of these women. Our gynocentric oasis of a civilization has literally drilled into these princesses the entitlement that men exist to serve women. Funny, I've heard that one somewhere?....oh yeah, feminism used to say that about men. The script has well and truly flipped.

Lastly she goes on to say:

>*Interviewer: Men should focus on building themselves?*  
>  
>*Her: Yeah, you gotta be 100% good with yourself, you confident with yourself before you get a girl.*

It's gotten to the point that women are literally starting to tell men how to be men. Just be yourself, women will love you for who you are is the most cancerous statement for a young man to hear.

The next girl drops ancient wisdom:

>*Interviewer: Do you have a friend you keep in the friend zone to buy you dinner, but then you hit up another dude when you wanna get real?*  
>  
>*Her: Yeah, thats exactly how it goes*

The joke is, you don't even need the Red Pill to tell you this anymore, men have become such worthless rags that woman will boast about using them an interview. This is normal Gen Z behavior, it serves women, so why would we expect anything else? Woman are so aware of blue pill nature, and will milk it for everything it's worth. Don't be the butt of this joke.

Then an HB6 goddess adds:

>*Her: He was telling me he loves me, and I didn't like him, so I had to cut it off*

The same guy who comes on here: ""But you guys over at the Red Pill are such mean woman haters, you don't know what love is all about"", while he drowns his sorrows in a masturbation binge.

The hypergamy bunny chimes in:

>*Interviewer: Do you think the grass is always greener?*  
>  
>*Her: Yeah, always*

While society shouts from the sidelines: ""You go girl, you can do better, that man don't deserve a princess like you""

Then our self aware hood rat brings some sense to all this:

>*Her: It stresses me out because WTF, this guy is giving me attention, why can't I love him?*  
>  
>*Interviewer: But then theres that guy who like spit on you at the bar...*  
>  
>*Her: Yeah and then it's like hit me up*

It's called AF/BB sweetheart. You get the tingles for the alpha, and the beta's dry your cooch faster than a Sub-Saharan summer. They're quite aware aware of this dynamic, do they care? No.

Last one is my favorite, this little meatball barks into the camera with a cigarette dangling out her hand that men need to:

>*Her: Workout, go swimming, take her for a walk, take her for dinner, have sex, I don't know just stop playing video games*

Telling of her desires for an alpha man, every word dripping with entitlement as her stomach hangs out, and lungs fill up with tar. She does however do a great job of telling men how to be men again I'll give her that.

Now these woman will almost certainly ride the carousel with vigor for the next decade or so and then splat against the wall with ravaged lady bits. I pity the poor blue pill save a ho that offers them a ladder to climb it, but I have no doubt that this generation of white knights will be lining up for the opportunity.

They'll do that because these women are not the exceptions, they are a representation of the attitude of the median woman coming off the Gen Z production line, and the median man coming off it is the most feminized schmuck in history. Every one of these responses drip with feminine superiority, repulsed by the needy, clingy devoid of Alpha trait males. With masculine traits labelled as ""toxic"" it's no wonder these men they speak of are so lost. A portion of the millennial's held this notion but the vast majority of Gen Z is more widely infected with it than ever before.

**The Nett result:** A generation of men behaving more feminine than ever, society filtering the presence of (toxic)masculinity. With men adopting a feminine approach we get females behaving more masculine than ever to fill the man void.

**Why is operating society on feminine empowerment values a problem?**

Well as packaged so nicely in a CH post. Men compete, then cooperate. Women compete, then cast out.

*Vertical male hierarchy ensures a place for everyone. Order is kept via rules-based discipline and the threat of demotion. Allows for graceful losing and peaceful surrender. Stable.*

*Horizontal female hierarchy causes massive churn, clique formation, uncertain and shifting status and frequent change of allegiance. Zero sum. Highly unstable.*

Try and Imagine an interview like the one above being conducted 80 years ago, under a male dominated society, women would quiver to address men in such a manner on a public platform.

**So lets just go back?**

Well for starters those banking on a return of the TradCon Values should jump ship now or alternatively learn how to navigate the current climate. No amount of Jordan Peterson videos is going to change the course of modern culture back to their TradCon paradise. Society is galloping away from TradCon values and not looking back(well besides the hopeful BP idealists doing the ostrich).

**Why wont a reversal work?**

This is a really complex multifaceted issue that would take a lot longer than this post is intended to be to really get stuck into, but as a brief introduction, conservative values wont work today because of the same reason they did work. Faith. The breakdown of a faith driven community(or even nationalism) tribalism approach to a more secular diverse globalism approach.

Faith was the glue that held conservative values together. There was a man in the sky watching over every woman's behavior. If she wanted to be in prime alpha selecting position she had to be a good, faith holding woman. Behavior swaying too far from the doctrine was condemned and shamed by society, no man would tolerate it.

Advancements in Science coupled with liberal dogma has left the institutions of marriage and religion more worthless than ever before. Many still hold onto faith for comfort but very few are internalizing that there is truly a deity watching over us and judging our behavior. I can count a total of zero people I know who live by the prescribed doctrine, it's simply not compatible with modern society. The closest I've met is a married pair of Jehovah's Witnesses, they live a very TradCon life but only interact with Jehovah's Witnesses so as to not interfere with their faith.

This is why the most religious(or strong cultural influence) countries, still hold the most TradCon values. E.G Saudi Arabia, North Korea etc

**So where does that leave us now?**

Without gods to judge us and direct our lives, humans become the gods of their own lives. What do gods do? Well, whatever they want. Add in a few wars, women entering the workplace, contraceptive pills, feminine law protection, globalization, the internet, cellphones, welfare and we have a society where woman are as free as they've ever been. And what does a free woman do? Well sample every Alpha penis that lands in her snatch of course.

Gen Z cheers and pats them on the back: ""YOLO, strong independent woman!"" while the saddest and unhappiest generation of men and women unfold in our recorded history. Woman not satisfied with their newfound empowerment because It just so happens that woman don't really like behaving like men. Like every cohesive, natural selection driven species they still need and want men, and not men behaving like woman type of men, biologically alpha men, so that natural selection/biology can take place effectively.

Societal pressures have pushed both men and women to stray further and further from their biological nature. Men adopting more feminine traits, with woman becoming more career driven, providing for themselves, providing their own(or potential to) food and shelter, not settling down, not having kids. Compound this with women not having the consequence of having a baby after spreading her legs and it's opened up sexual promiscuity instead of strict selectiveness. The Alpha traits they would have selected for are labelled as toxic so they become more dormant in society than ever before. The less we are aligned socially with our biological nature the less happy we become.

I learnt from my cousin that she can't help but attract fuckboys. It appears that they are some of the last bastions of masculinity, now given a derogatory label in an attempt to shame Alpha behaviors. Her description of a fuckboy: *Gym guys who fuck, but don't ever commit*. It's truly one of lifes greatest riddles why they won't commit and settle with one vag in the greatest vag buffet in history. They're called called fuckboys because well, they fuck. And then all the ""nice guys"" of Gen Z offering commitment are the guys you heard about in our lovely short film.

**So what to do?**

No matter what direction we go in it will simply be another society, one we will need to learn to navigate all the same, so I'll open that discussion to the floor.

My last thought, TRP is going to be more relevant than ever with Gen Z. With a free and unregulated sexual market, it's the Alpha that is once again king. No more supposed one for one marriage, in a free market AF/BB is the order of the day. The Top 20% will be drowning in it while the remaining 80% go hungry, at least until they're established and even then they'll be picking from the post wall pool. It's like we've gone back to the principles that governed early man.

In the absence of stable women, plating is more relevant than ever. With the pussy buffet pumping, vetting is of paramount importance. With unregulated hypergamy a man needs to be outcome independent and willing to drop his treasured unicorn more than ever.

The market can still work for the individual, as long as he doesn't expect whats not being delivered and knows how to navigate the murky waters of the SMP that lies ahead.​",1053,4.0,0.43799999356269836,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

Sets up elaborate proposal including candles, glitter, and rose petals. Has her read a rhyming poem that ends with him asking who the other guy is. She looks up shocked, he bails without a word, and gets into his car and drives off holding a pink dildo.

**Backstory:** Decent guy. Goodlooking, fit, well groomed, smart, not a total beta finds out that his soon to be wife is actually a whore through her facebook account and stuff. She's been pretending to be in love and all the jazz but she's been fucking a guy called Thomas Roo behind his back.

She sends Thomas the same nude pics that she sends to her fiance . Fucks him. But hides it from the guy in the video. This guy even had requested her to just tell him to walk away if she wants to be with someone else. But no, she wants to keep the beta husband as well as the boy toy on the side. Guy feels devastated cuz of the sham she tried to pull off and plans to dump her shamefully and record that he has not done any physical harm to her or her house to protect himself from the police.

A sixteen minute video but well worth the watch and something everyone will be able to relate to on here. This setup is a few weeks after he realizes she's a whore. You will she the feeling of pure freedom and liberty when you see him escape out in the end and play the music in his car as he drives away.

Edit: on awalt, I agree with it and what it entails, but generally ive found that all people are like that its just that men have given them the world and that was the mistake.

They have been sheltered from every form of hardship and are given handouts for doing nothing more than complaining.

If men were raised as women are I doubt we would be better than them.

Parties every weekend, not an iota of worry about debt piling up - as long as there is cash flow everything is fine, right?

1066,futnk0,"I live in the UK, and currently we're on lockdown because of the kung-flu so I thought I'd share my journey with you all. 

Looking back at a younger more inexperienced version of myself, I was bp beta, like I imagine a lot of you were before your awakening. In high school I was the funniest in my year, but if you saw a picture of me you'd know I had to be... I wasn't a great looking kid, not ugly, but on the lower end of average. I had a perfectly round head and my balls didn't drop till I was 17 so even if a girl did take an interest it's not like I could've progressed very much. 

Once I left school after a measly performance in classes I didn't like, to be honest that I only took because girls I fancied were in them, I got my first job as an apprentice administrator. £6.50 per hour - wooohooooo! I used to work with 4 of the most bitter women I have ever crossed paths with. I knew it wasn't going to work, and to be honest, it wasn't the kind of administration I had hoped for... I was thinking it'd be like Edward Snowden but it was more like Peggy Olson from madmen. But I worked, and worked, first in last to leave until a small dip in share price gave room for the ""last in first out"" schtick. 

I was 17, making the shittest amount of fucking money ever, barely had any friends, and was getting nowhere with girls. Nowhere. You know that Louie CK bit where he says ""I couldn't talk to women I'd just walk up and go cOuLd yOu FUCK mE?"" that's me. 

Fast forward to my 20th birthday (2015). I went on to YouTube and one of the suggestions was ""Bill Burr - Let it Go"". I've always been a massive comedy fan, and religiously watch specials so I thought, I'll give this no-name guy a try... wow, what an experience. This was peak Burr doing what he's good at, and being a fiery red head myself, thought I want to see more of this guy! So I looked him up, a couple of MMPC episodes later, and he's talking about this ""Patrice"" guy and how he had such game with women.. I'm like yeah right but if Burr finds him funny, maybe I'll like him too.

\*QUEUE EVERY OPIE AND ANTHONY CLIP EVER MADE WITH PATRICE, BLACK PHILLIP SHOW, ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM, ALL LIVE SHOWS LATER\* 

I seriously consumed this guys content like it was heroin. Not only was he saying EVERYTHING I had to hear but he made it so authentically funny that it all resonated instantly. My anxiety about women seemed to melt and I felt like I had entered a new world. Patrice O'neal gave me my first ever red pill. 

I then had the confidence to phone up and demand an entry level position within a local 'sales' firm, I interviewed that same day, and had the offer by the next days lunch. 

I worked tirelessly. My hours were 8am - 5:30pm, but I'd usually stay until 8 most nights to get a jump on the next day. Thats where I met Nicole. I had some game now... I thought... and enough confidence to back up a swagger + I was good at the job and well respected by directors, so I had some situational clout. 

We went to the head office for training, and we fucked. Then when we got back, it carried on for some months till I left to go to a better firm for more money and better commission. By the time I was 22, I was making £5k a month, easily spending £3k on cocaine, hotel rooms, and nights out to impress more girls, finally I was getting the attention I always craved. 

One night out, I met this girl who would later become an LTR. This is already long so I'll spare you the whole story but she cheated and got pregnant to some chad, and like Patrice said, just walk away, so I did. She hit me for 3 months, I never went back. 

So feeling at an all time low, I started watching Patrice again. He used to have this guy on called Dante Niro, and I realised I had never really payed him any attention, so I searched him on Youtube and watched an interview with Sam Roberts, where he talks about a culture on reddit called the Red Pill and MGTOW communities. It peaked my interest, so I looked this up.

\*QUEUE READING EVERY FUCKING BOOK THOSE CUNTS HAVE EVER WRITTEN, MULTIPLE ROOSH HOURS, RED MAN GROUPS, ETC\*

Like it says in the book, lift, dress well, eat right, etc. So I did. The plan was never look like Dorian Yates or be as strong as Eddie Hall, but just to have a t-shirt fit right. Not too tight round the sleeve etc. After about 1 year of that, banging sluts, becoming totally teetotal, I was starting to have doubts over it. Im mean is all life is about to bang girls? Because that's getting pretty repetitive and for fuck sake is every girl this fucking boring?! REALLY?! YOU LIKE DOGGOS AND HATE TRUMP?! WOW!

So this was already on my mind, and then one night last week I watched the Red Man Group with Turd Flinging Monkey (I assume most of you know who he is). For context, the Red Man Group is supposed to be a group of the hard hitting red pillars within the community, and Donovan Sharpe. Rollo is there, Richard Cooper is there, Shawn Smith is there. TFM made them look like little boys. He totally schooled them all. His frame was bulletproof, and he was very calculated in everything he said. 

Donovan Sharpe that cuck fuck kept trying to bait him into saying ""oh I'm just a beta I can't get girls"" but TFM calmly explained that it's not too much effort - it just isn't worth it... and I agree. I have achieved nothing from banging sluts. I had a sense of emptiness and for what?! 10 minutes of sex and then a ""eh so we can maybe get drinks during the week or something"" or ""I got to go I have work"", why the fuck are they so destined to deny that ""the juice is worth the squeeze""? WHY?! it isn't! One of the 'godfathers' of the manosphere and probably the most prolific out of everyone, Roosh, has tapped out and found God and seems much happier!

TFM - you opened my eyes. Thank you.

I don’t really watch any of them at all, but I’ve heard of them as they are pretty big “stars” on the platform. Apparently this Kate girl that Carson was dating was essentially a nobody before she starting talking to him, and he started having her on his streams and such.

I believe roughly about a month ago Carson stopped uploading because he was extremely depressed. Then, just 1 or 2 days ago, the news came out that Kate had cheated on him with Fitz.

I don’t know about how anyone else sees this, but this is how I see it. Kate was a nobody who used Carson to get famous, then when Carson stopped uploading she realized her views and subscribers were going to drop as well. So she decided that she’s going to get with another big prominent Youtuber, Fitz! This will be an easy way to ensure that her views stay up and she stays relevant. She got a taste of the good life, and now she’ll do anything to stay there. I honestly feel bad for Carson because he seemed like a pretty nice guy who didn’t deserve this, and hey, maybe it’ll lead him here, you never know.

I knew their daughter(lets call her jennifer) but havent talked a lot. After couple hours, when we were leaving, her mother asked me to stay couple days with them and I accepted. A day later I realized Jennifer started acting kinda wierd, I saw where this was going. That night she was really flirty and playful, she was touching me all over and lying with me on the bed. This wasnt the first time a girl was doing this to me, I think it was 4th. Every time I simple stood up and just made up a lie, got out of the place without making it weird. I did the same thing. Next day I was home and she was still a friend of mine. Chose to not lose my virginity again. Whenever I told this story to my friends all of them called me dumb, told me to take the chance I get(which is not something you get a lot in this country). I didnt really agree with them. I think of it like a trade, it is not something girl is giving you and you are taking it. Both genders are participating and even though she found me good enough I didnt feel the same way with her. A month later when I was talking to a friend(female) of mine, she told me that she fought with Jennifer. And another month later when I was talking with my friend again she told me that Jennifer had 8 boyfriends at the same time. “ Those 8 guys didnt really believe it to be true, they all said she wouldnt do it. Then they decided to meet and talk about it. They meet up and checked each others messages. She has been sending them the same nudes and the same messages at the same time.

Short story:

I had a female guest stay at my place (I do Airbnb sometimes). After a couple of drinks, we started to discuss certain topics.

One of them was male/female sexuality.

I told her that women could not, and would not, think outside of ""What does he HAVE that makes him attractive"".

I also stated that, if women were really passionate creatures, then they would be far more open and straight forward about physical contact. Be it a hug, kiss or more.

She told me, with a nonchalant gesture and an arrogant voice:

""If we get horny, we can satisfy ourselves. We dont need a man for that"".

I was totally dumb founded by her answer.

Women like her (she was low level gold digger, chasing looser kids just to stay with them and give em some pussy whilst enjoying material gains) are SO COLD, they would prefer to have a rubber dildo in their twat, than to have the warm body of a man kiss, touch, caress and embrace them.

I am still struck by her words, but more than words, her attitude.

I have witnessed women who came home from a brainwashed agenda filled with hate and guilt, incapable of making life better with positive outlets. Women were misled into a losing ideology, falling into a path of jealousy, pity and misery for many years.

And I can tell you this: these people you idolize spent their lives living in shame and right now, they have died with empty ideas and bitter lives.

1101,3ok28h,"Hello MGTOW (and any ladies lurking here).



I am new to reddit and to MGTOW. If you look at my profile you'll note that I have been a redditor only for about a month. In that month, I have seen 4 women post to /r/MGTOW. These 4 women are :

* (1) /u/BugRover
* (2) /u/bchsweetheart
* (3) /u/DeafLady
* (4) /u/Bekazzled



Now each of these women actually admitted to being a woman and I came across the admission. This means that there may be other women who have posted to /r/MGTOW without admitting their sex **OR** they did admit their sex and I have not come across the admission. In other words there is every possibility that the number of women who have posted to /r/MGTOW is greater than 4 this last month.



If I look at the /u/BugRover profile, I notice that the account was used to post only to /r/MGTOW. Further, the lady behind this account made a submission [What is You Definition of a Unicorn?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/3m8lpc/what_is_you_definition_of_a_unicorn/) In a reply to this submission /u/bchsweetheart posted certain comments. Had /u/BugRover posted to other sub-reddits, I suppose that /u/bchsweetheart came across her, took a look at her profile and decided to post replies to her submission. However, as I pointed out /u/BugRover did **not** post on any other sub-reddits. So how did /u/bchsweetheart come across the post by /u/BugRover?



At this point I can think of only 2 possible explanations :

* (1) There is a conspiracy between /u/BugRover and /u/bchsweetheart. These two ladies decided to wade in here for some reason and achieve some objective. Problem is this doesn't explain the other two ladies posting here unless we extend it to a world wide conspiracy of all women headquartered in Mount PussyDoom - Mount PussyDoom being as real as the *patriarchy* and led by [Dr. Jessica Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Valenti) who prefers male tears shaken and **NOT** stirred.

* (2) A lot of women lurk around here. So although the probability of a single woman posting here is pretty low, given the large number of women lurking here it is only a matter of time before some woman posts here and occasionally replies to a submission by another woman. I think this is more believable than Mount PussyDoom.



So the fact is gentlemen (and ladies who are lurking here) that a lot of ladies are lurking here. Question is why and what do we do? Some of us gentlemen are of the opinion that this should be a male only sub-reddit. Others are not against ladies posting here as long as it concerns MGTOW and does not contain feminist bullshit like women **never** falsely accuse men of rape and all men rape but we don't hear about it because women are too scared to speak out.



Not only this, I think that the women who post here are completely ignorant of MGTOW. For example, /u/Bekazzled thinks that because she doesn't buy into marriage and kids means she is MGTOW. Lady you are a Woman Going Your Own Way and the sub-reddit for you is /r/WGTOW. Besides if you choose not to have marriage and kids it is your choice - for many of us it is not a choice but a compulsion since the costs of marriage for men is astronomical (no fault divorce and associated stuff).



Further, it is possible that these women think that they can **get** a man from here. Problem is, that even if these women are anti-feminist and traditional - the laws aren't. So if a man gets married to her, she could later change and take him to the cleaners - after separating him from his kids no doubt. But if the men here don't budge and give in to these women then the women will have wasted their time and effort.


This leads to questions :

* (1) Why are women lurking here?  What do they want?

* (2) Should women be allowed to post here?

* (3) Should MGTOW shun even anti-feminist women?

* (4) Is the aim of MGTOW to reverse feminism as per the [manifesto](https://exposingfeminism.wordpress.com/mgtow-manifesto/) or do we reject the manifesto and stay away from women even after feminism goes bust?

* (5) Do we consider these women to be our allies or enemies?

* (6) [45% of single mothers in the US live below the poverty line](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2013/11/25/about-half-of-kids-with-single-moms-live-in-poverty/). Given that [70% of men aged 20 - 34 are not married](http://cnsnews.com/news/article/barbara-hollingsworth/bachelor-nation-70-men-aged-20-34-are-not-married), it follows that sooner or later 31.5% (45% of 70%) of young women in the US will have to choose between remaining childless or living in poverty. Compare with a failed state called Pakistan where because of **patriarchy** and marriage poverty rates are evenly distributed between men and women at [22.3%](http://data.worldbank.org/country/pakistan). Clearly, feminism has hit women just as hard as men - if not harder. Sooner or later women will realize this. Then what? Do we take them back (i.e. white knight) or do we turn our backs on them because they turned their backs on us?



Please think and answer. Personally, I don't know what the answers are. Further feel free to add any other views/ideas.

To live in a Police State with no rights to my children, no reproductive rights, and as a father, I have less rights than a murderer in a court of law?

1110,7kba5v,"I just experienced the greatest confirmation for blazing my own trail. One paragraph of background, then I will begin the anecdote proper.

I'm near enough to thirty, and generally make any purchases for utility, as opposed to status. While I am careful to hide my wealth, my need for new motorized wheelchairs worth $30,000 every 5 years, and my comfortable lifestyle hint at my true holdings.

Anyway, back to the story; My Highschool crush, let's call her *Kate*. Yes, that name will suffice here.

Kate had a teenage pregnancy at 14. After having her daughter, she got back into shape, and had her amazing athleticframe, with only a little extra fat in her breasts and ass. And she was so smart, for a female at least, edging out a close second, to my dominance in classes grades 

I had asked her out 3 times, the first time I was told ""Not today, my daughter needs a check-up."" The second time was ""I have standards."" The third time she said ""no thanks"" then proceeded to utterly destroy me on MySpace, and tore my heart asunder. She posted my name, photo and a meme of me being an ""unlovable waste of atmosphere that ought to be purged with fire"" If the Floppy disk wasn't corrupted, I'd post the image as a sign of my 'turning point'. I commented back and I quote: ""Mark my words, I'll be renting your daughter out by the hour."" 

Anyway, she tried to contact me all these years later, to hook up with me after the recent Crypto-Currency boom. I looked up her Facebook profile and was dismayed to see how the ravages of 16 years have torn away everything I ever liked in her. I told her to call me, because I loathe paper-trails.

Kate, despite being so smart, or trying to lure me into a false sense of security, did so... No, I did not give her my personal number, my Business phone number being able to be found easily in my local area would work, Hooray for advertising! Also, I live in a 'All Party Consent' Call recording state in Australia.

The Conversation went down as following.

>Kate: Hey Chad, It's been a while hasn't it?
>
>Me: Speak Quickly; You have no need for my services. What do you want from me?
>
>Kate: Is the Drinks offer still open?
>
>Me: That train is long past. I'm not unreasonable however..
>
>Kate: Still a fucking asshole...
>
>Me:  Your exact term was ""Unlovable waste of atmosphere that ought to be purged with fire"" if I recall correctly... (Hearty Laugh.) In hindsight, it was probably the greatest gift I could have ever recieved.
>
>Me: Your Daughter looks like you in her prime. She's legal...
>
>Kate: Allie?
>
>Me: She looks as gorgeous as her mother at her age. I'll be at (Bar name) at (Time) and if she wants to meet me there, great.
>
>Kate: ... 
>
>Me: It's been a pleasure.

I hang up at that point.

The Daughter, Allie actually shows up... and she let slip while drunk that she was paying her way through Uni by being an Escort.

MGTOW - is over women and interested in self improvement. essentially Androcentrism.

Women have always treated me like shit.

Yeah, I got some occasional lays but I had to go to the ends of the earth to get them. No girl ever approached me and said lets fuck unless she ugly, obese or very old. I had to go out and approach thousands of woman to get lays. 

I've gotten tricked by countless women who hinted they would give up pussy yet never did. Even when I did get laid, the women would always act like they were doing me a huge favor and I should worship them. In the end it was always a shitty experience. Even if they orgasmed they never gave a shit if I did.

Tinder and online dating? At one point I had thousands of matches (from auto-liking) and I could easily go out on a date with a new girl each day. Yet the majority of girls I met would never want to fuck and all wanted a relationship before giving up the pussy. Even the hottest looking girls on tinder looked horrible in person. It was a massive scam and a huge waste of time at best.

I don't know where this Chad bullshit originated from but I say with full confidence that women treat everyone like shit. And why should they? Even the ugliest woman has an endless amount of dick to choose from. It's doubtful any woman is going to treat any one guy special.

Would you treat any woman as special if you had and endless amount of woman who wanted to buy you free dinners and fuck you?




Edit: Parting thoughts. Men seem to have this fantasy in their minds that if they make enough money, get enough muscles, enough status, spit enough game women will treat them like a king and look up to them, giving them affection daily and treating them like a mom (sometimes) would her newborn son.  - I'VE NEVER SEEN THIS HAPPEN, EVER -

1128,6m4y0e,"TLDR
MGTOW forces men and women further apart. Western society cannot survive if men and women reject each other. But we don't want the West to die, we want to rebuild the West. Therefore, MGTOW is bad. 

(I want to hear your thoughts on this. Shoot me a reply.) 

MGTOW, if it succeeds, will destroy society. A civilisation where men and women are separated cannot stand - or ""every kingdom divided against itself shall be brought to desolation"" as Jesus would say. 

What are you guys trying to accomplish exactly? Where is MGTOW taking society? I can't help but feel like MGTOW only exists to spite women, to move away from them so they finally understand that they need men. To me, MGTOW is a bitchy ""have it your way then"" to feminists. MGTOW is a boy's response. It's a tantrum. Sort of like, 'Oh, you don't need us do you? Well goodbye then!' 

The family unit of a Mother, Father, and children is the bedrock of Western Civilisation. Feminism is bad because it seeks to destroy the family unit. But so does MGTOW. MGTOW despises the family as much as the radical feminists. If the West has any hope of surviving the next century or two, we MUST return to the family unit. 

Don't tell me there aren't any good women left. That's bullshit. I grew up in a church and I'm convinced that all the best women are in churches. I'm not saying all Christian women are perfect. But from my experience, a lot of young single Christian women have their eyes firmly focused on marriage. One man for life. They don't go to clubs. They don't do drugs. They don't fuck around. They save themselves for marriage and dedicate themselves to Motherhood. Most Christian women will also submit to their husbands in the biblical sense. They acknowledge that the man is the head of the house and they respect his authority over them. 

MGTOW is the equal and opposite of feminism. Both will lead to the ruin of society. Civilisation cannot survive if men and women reject each other. Men, don't 'go your own way'. Try and find a woman who will raise a strong family with you. Women like this still exist. (However, I have never found one outside a church.)

I'm a long time lurker on this sub, and agree with pretty much everything you guys talk about. There is one major thing that I don't understand though... Many of you emphasize how women these days are only good for their looks, and thus bring no real value to relationship. Many of you agree that women ""infiltrating"" the workforce is a BAD THING. You wish for a time before ""modern"" feminism, where women are stay at home moms. This is a huge part of MGTOW that I've seen constantly come up.

With that in mind, isn't a huge part of MGTOW flawed? If women aren't in the workforce, they provide LESS value to a relationship. If they don't have equal opportunity (workplace involvement) to men, then they just have the rely on their looks EVEN MORE. Once again, many of you complain that women just have to be pretty in this day-n-age, and they can can get a way higher (perceived) value partner. See how this is sort of a paradox?

If it were the 1950s, would you guys complain about how women are worthless and only good for their looks? What exactly is the ""ideal"" woman to you guys? A stay at home mom? Well if that's the case, she is pretty much a gold digger and is therefor worthless in your guys eyes. What about a hard working female who competes in the workforce? Well it seems like you guys wouldn't want that either (for a magnitude of reasons based on MGTOW believes)...

Can you guys understand the confusion I have here? I am extremely red pilled and am definitely MGTOW. I see so much truth in the posts I see everyday on this reddit. However, this ""paradox"" is really bothering me. I'm questioning if mine (and your guys') standards are too high for women. What do we really want?

Most men don't have a long string of requirements. I'll speak here for myself, but primarily and I mean way up front there in terms of requirements is I want a reasonably attractive female who actually enjoys sex. 

There's so much that rests on just that statement alone because it's the plight of most men on this planet. The sheer amount of effort and live long sacrifice and torture you have to go through to get this almost doesn't make it worth it. 

Indeed if it was just down to plain maths and logic, most men would NEVER get involved with a modern female. They're lazy, have no empathy and cannot fathom what you even want in the first place. The ones that do are AWALT, acting and have some agenda anyways. Yes, they want something from you. 

This leads me to my first point. Don't believe too much you hear from women about how ""The bastard left her for a younger woman"". I'm 41 now with a partner of 42. I can tell you, I'm just as horny as I was when I was 20, my partner, however, seems to almost have given up on sex. A lot of guys in this situation were driven to seek sex outside the partnership. Let me ask you, how much fun is it coming home to a roommate? That's not what we signed up for. 

Then the cherry on the cake is they make sure you have a kid with them and that's the final crushing blow before they withdraw sex almost completely, because after that now you're too invested to leave. Or so they think. 

Don't believe their victim shit. Women by far and large are the ones who primarily break the unwritten contract by losing sexual interest in their partner. Yeah, I forgot to mention, most of these women would still very much drop their panties for a Chad given the chance. It's not that they're bored with sex, it's that they simply get bored of you. 

An interim point here is that while guys also can get bored of sex, they mostly would rather have regular predictable sex than no sex at all. Women can withhold sex for months, and in extreme cases YEARS. 

This leads me to my final point. There are consequences. A woman who doesn't put in even the most basic of effort by trying to keep slim, and at least have some basic fucking interest in sex, is actually arrogant and cocky. These are the same arrogant and cocky women who play the victim later. 

In my own situation, I can tell you, it's at this stage just about the biological urge, I doubt I will ever have an actual connection with a woman again. I also don't have the patience for an affair. I simply am done chasing women. If something had to passively come around, I would not say no, but I'm not putting in the enormous amounts of work required to actually pull off an affair. 

Do you know how you hear those stories about how some guy met a new girl at work? That's not either. I know girls 10 years younger than I am who are actually interested in me, and some other blue pill might have made a move a long time ago. All I see are red flags and uncertainty. 

My solution is a bit more simple - yeah hookers. Bite me. I still have biological urges, and GFE is at least for now the way for me to solve it. 

That's how useless women are. They are so shit at taking care of a man's basic instincts and desires that even though he's in a relationship he has to go looking for ""That thing"" elsewhere.

Why did that Boeing crash? Yet again we don't get an 'ex plane' ation. Turns out Flying Fortresses have a HUGE SECRET to them. Ready??

\#Imagine you're on a Jumbo Jet airplane and suddenly all the engines stop working, what happens next? Well .... the next thing that happens is that all these bags drop out of the ceiling and you HAVE TO PUT THEM ON, and they make you stoned within seconds so you pass out. Ever wondered why these masks exist? Why is it necessary to sedate airline passengers?

\#ConsiderThis: In all heavier-than-air jet planes (like Jumbo Jets), if one or multiple jet engines fail, only one jet engine is required stay in the air! There is no explanation yet from Boeing or NASA as to how Jumbo Jets can stay in the air with only a SINGLE ENGINE operating on ONE (not both) wings. Remember the movie Memphis Belle (1990)? Remember at the end of the movie, the B-17 Bomber was flying with only a SINGLE ENGINE operating ONLY ONE WING? Why didn’t the plane immediately drop to one side? What about the real life examples where \*ALL\* engines  failed and the massive plane was able to turn 180 degrees and return safely to the ground? (Read: Miracle on the Hudson cited at the end of the OP for an example). Have to agree after the last few crashes that something mysterious is failing within these planes, right? I mean, it's not an led light that's the problem here.

\#BigSecret: Electromagnetic technology secretly keeps the planes afloat once the (noisy) jet engines are running, while propellers are only used to move the plane forward. EM is 10\\\^39 more powerful than Gravity, thus anti-gravity technology is trivial and simple to design, and was invented a very long time ago. Starting in WW2, this technology was built into the planes in such a way that their own pilots and engineers did not realize it. This was the only way they could get these TEENAGE PILOTS into the planes and send them hundreds of miles on bombing raids. Allied bombing raids using child pilots is the inspiration behind the book Ender's Game. Older vets would have objected to the global air-force bombings, and they still do today, thus all pilot decision making has been replaced by AUTOMATED DRONE AI. Smaller stunt planes do not need such technology to fly (many still use it, as do all drone bombers), but all Boeing Bombers (i.e. B17, B52) absolutely did since they needed to carry a major payload (unlimited weight) in bombs. These automated over-sized cargo bombers were responsible for over 15 million deaths during the 20th century as they dropped Napalm and other incendiary bombs over 3 thousand human cities towns and villages. Had the allies used normal anti gravity technology to win the war, they would have sent the Memphis Belle boys in flying saucers. The pilots would be well aware of the technology by the end of the war, and we'd all be in our own saucers today.

\#TheOnlyReason to build an airplane that could never fly by aerodynamic technology alone \*IS\* to hid the technology from the very pilots who are winning the Allies war. Can you agree that saturated air bombing won WW2? All those houses in that movie The Pianist? 67 Cities in Japan, etc etc. This is how we won WW2. This is how NAZI Germany, North Korea, Japan & Vietnam were completely destroyed. This is why you CANNOT get an aviators license without DIRECT APPROVAL by the FAA, which requires a written and oral test proving that you 'understand' (believe in) aerodynamics heavier-than-air flight. This is why the NASA/Boeing boys club has always been so corrupted. This is why NASA is fake, created entirely in-house by Lockheed Martin and Boeing. This is why Jumbo Jets have not improved in design in over 70 \*YEARS\*. This is why all Jumbo Jets look identical. This is why they NEVER CRASH (with the exception of a major uptick in unexplained crashes since 2014). This is why 9/11 involved (cgi) Jumbo Jets and turned airports into PRISONS. This explains ALL UFO SIGHTINGS. This explains CHEMTRAILS (No human pilots required). Consider that this is the secret NSA (and recently TSA) were created to protect. This is why basically everything you know about the ruinous 20th century, our darkest century. How does one keep such an obvious secret this whole time? Any country that doesn't go along with 'the plan' gets bombs instead of airports.

Q: No seriously, WHY are you doing this?

A: If you can't tell, there is a serious epidemic of censorship destroying the internet we used to know.

1154,8377c0,"I feel like large parts of society is telling us that men have to carry the burden of supporting women. Essentially men must provide to even if it is to their detriment.

Honestly some of the extreme views on MGTOW reddit offend me. They can be very sexist and discriminatory. So I'm somewhat hesitant to associate myself with MGTOW. Having said there I think there are a lot of good, well-intention people on here and I respect that.

I feel like there are maybe three or more stages men go through:

1. **Ignorance** - unaware of current status quo and the imbalances.

2. **Anger** at women and society which we see on MGTOW reddit.

3. **Self-love and strong boundaries** - Understand that we are all fallible. Women are like us men.... just trying to get through life. That doesn't mean we need to demonize them. We can reject the status quo and lead good, healthy lives in harmony with others while respecting women. That doesn't mean we have to bend to their will.

to feel better, i tried to just dont care anymore. at first i pretented, but after some years, it went real.

monks are allowed to speak only 7 words to women. they cannot touch them and they cannot stare at them. also, they cannot be in a room/house alone with a woman.


at first, these rules seem kind of silly/impractical, but iam practicing them as good as i can and achieving good results overall.
the brain and body are adopting to the idea, that there never will be sensual/emotional interactions with someone. it takes a lot of time to truly understand this fact. both rational and subconscious.

it can be a peaceful mindstate. without the sexual urge and craving for emotional (fake) support, you can truly start to discover yourself in whatever way you want.

personally, iam in no way perfect. i just want to propose the general idea of acceptance. with acceptance comes peacefullness and happiness. i mean, what are alternatives? no women means now humanity. they are an equal part of the human race, so i think acceptance is the only true way to go.

tl;dr follow buddhism monk rules and let women be women. they can do whatever they want and you do whatever you want. they wont care and you wont care, no interaction/emotions involved from either side.

1158,14haxi,"Dear feminists, and by feminists, I mean most of you sorry cretins who inhabit r/mensrights.


Good afternoon, my name is John, some of you may be familiar with my work. This letter is hopefully clear up a few misperceptions and put to rest the concerns of many members pf this community.


Several days ago, my colleague and friend Paul was shadow banned, not by the moderators of /r/mr, but by the administration of reddit. Similarly, Dean Esmay, with whom I work at AVFM was also shadow banned. Apparently, this was due to their endorsement or public statement of support for discovering the identities and publishing the names of feminist participants and organizers of the U of T Warren Farrell protest.


I have also been told by some members of this community that stooping to the tactics of the enemy is unacceptable. Addressing this claim literally, I agree. I completely agree that censorship, intimidation, threats of death, advocating violence, initiating violence, and cultivating hate against a group based on identity or sex, s totally unacceptable. However, the criticism directed towards me used that rhetoric, but referred to my advocation of publication of identity the woman harassing a man at Warren Farrell's protest. The “you are fucking scum” woman. 


And apparently, my genuine intention to attach her public behavior to her name is seen as “stooping to the tactics of feminists”


Are you fucking kidding me?


Why do any of you dolts imagine Paul, Dean, myself and other actual MRAs advocate public exposure of the evangelists of hatred and the initiators of proxy violence? Do you think, in your pea brains we intend harm to come to the cretins we document?  A summary pass through any of our collected writing  will quickly disabuse you of that stupid assumption.


In fact the concern over the practice of outing the agents of hatred and the initiators of proxy violence is not a moral concern at all. It's fear of offending the powerful. On Reddit, that would be the feminist hegemony who seem able to indulge in any cruelty and hate with impunity – on the misguided notion that if only we in the r/mr reddit were a bit nicer, they'd come right around and embrace the undeniable reality of our concerns.


Stupid and cowardly. Thats what this concern is. 


And just in case any of you slow-witted dolts haven't got it yet, while I wont do it on reddit – respecting the rules of the house here, outside of this forum, I will publish the name of anyone – male or female, MRA or Feminist who advocates violence or initiates violence, including by proxy, and I'll do it with satisfied smile on my face, and not even a slight twinge of guilt. 


Or do you snivelers think accountability is only for men, and that women, or feminists (including feminist men) have a free licence to commit and cultivate violence and hate?




Do you think women are so fucking helpless and infantile they cannot possibly own any accountability – even in the commission of direct violence? If you /do/ think this, then you are indistinguishable from a gender ideologue, and you will have earned my unlimited contempt. How can you possibly oppose violence without supporting accountability for it's direct and proxy initiation? 


Oh, and if anybody, after reading this cares to claim that publicly identifying the initiators of violence is /actually/ a backhanded technique for putting them in harms way, then you're too stupid to be allowed to participate in an adult conversation. Yes, you too David.


Anti-feminism is the revolutionary notion that women are (like men) moral agents.


I expect I'll be getting banned on reddit directly after posting this, which will simply be the wider reddit community making itself even less relevant on the topic of the Men's Rights Movement. 


And to the Reddit Admins: Go on, ban me, and tell yourselves the violence cultivated and committed by the feminist community is harmless because it principally targets men.

Just that, rights for men. Our topics are generally about divorce laws, custody laws, equal treatment under the law, false-rape accusations, domestic violence, gender double-standards, feminist hypocrisy.

You're cool. We have no problem with you.


**""Why is everyone so hateful to me?""**

You have an expectation of being coddled and pandered to.  When that is removed you think it is people being hateful towards you. You were just spoiled before and are having to adapt. You don't get to bully men here just because you are saying feminist things.

Yes, we call you ""white knights"" and we were you once. You are just our past selves. 


**""I've been married for over two years and...""**

Awww... *pats you on the head like a cute little scamp*


**""... but feminism is about equality!""**

No. You bought into the hype:

1. Fighting sexism against women and ignoring sexism against men is not fighting for equality,

2. ""Women need more rights so there is equality"" is just playing victim, not seeking equality.


**""I have a right to post here!""**

Yes, but ask yourself why you are really in a subreddit that tries to discuss the issues of men's rights when it is not really allowed in feminist subreddits. Question your own motives. Are you really here for discussion or just to scream at us that we are wrong?


**""The patriarchy hurts everyone""**

The patriarchy is not a catch-all for all your gripes about the world. It is not the dark side of the force. It is not satan. It is a convenient excuse for feminists to avoid responsibility.

** ""No, but I really believe in equality!""**

Good. Seriously - good. However don't just say that then go back to fighting only for women. We believe in equality too.


**""You're all just a bunch of....""**

Please keep your shaming and insults to yourself. You are just stereotyping and over-generalizing based on what you already want to believe. It isn't going to stop us from talking to each other and it is just you acting on reflex. 


**""You can't seriously be saying that women aren't worse off over all""**

Yes. We are saying that. [Here is the proof](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/1033)

**""You can't seriously be saying that feminists conspire against men""**

Yes. We are saying that.  If you can't accept that, then just leave. You've been indoctrinated and are resisting breaking free of that conditioning. Think critically, question us, think for yourself - but don't just react with your pre-programmed conditioned assumptions. 


**""Well this all seems very negative and you should value our comments about...**

No. We have no shortage of feminists coming here thinking their opinions are precious. We aren't interested in fostering more feminists posting here. If, however, you insist on posting here - then please lurk and listen for a while before jumping into discussions, disagreeing angrily, and/or openly trolling.

In case you guys haven't noticed, we are a tiny group of people fighting an incredibly powerful and well-funded hate movement. This hate movement has connections in all levels of government, and has purposefully turned society against men.

I have been talking about MRA-related stuff for 17 years now. And no matter how ""nice"" i used to be, no matter how logical i tried to make my arguments, and no matter how far i went out of my way to prove my egalitarian mindset, I was always painted as the evil woman abuser simply because I wasn't a dedicated kool-aide drinker.

Eventually I realized that as a MAN, I will be called into question NO MATTER WHAT I SAY OR DO. And as an MRA, I will be hated no matter what I say or do. Therefore, I simply think there is no reason for us to be nice and accommodating to people who want us dead.

If we look at history we find that virtually every group that has been singled out for hate and persecution has being subjected to this technique.

In Europe before world war two, the claim that jews abducted and murdered children was circulated, called blood libel.

In america, claims that black, men had a preference for raping white women were popularized.

The aim of these claims is simple: it's an attempt to make the public believe that the target group are not like them, that they are *bad by nature*. If they are bad by nature then the public can then be told to ignore everything they say without consideration. And that's what this is about: the hate group tries to stop the public considering the target groups words because they fear that the public will find merit in them, so they attempt to deny them that consideration.

I'm sure this thread will attract responses which pretend to be shocked that I've dared to compare what's happening with the plight of Jewish or black people.

I encourage you to stay positive through this.

A JUDGE has refused to immediately jail a young man for having sex with a 13-year-old girl saying today’s youth do not realise underage sex is a serious crime.

District Court Judge Rosemary Davey says Sasha Pierre Huerta, 21, was not a predator and his teenage victim “was looking for” a sexual encounter.

In transcripts viewed by The Advertiser, Judge Davey says teens living in our “overtly sexualised” world are ignorant of the maximum seven-year jail term for underage sex.

“Regrettably — and I don’t live in an ivory tower — that kind of criminal conduct is happening day in, day out,” she says.

“In fact, if you ask most 17-year-olds or 16-year-olds whether they know (underage sex) was an offence carrying seven years’ imprisonment, they would die with their leg in the air.

“It’s just crazy, in my view, that we maintain this law and we do not pass the message on out into the community.”

Huerta, 21, of Walkerville, pleaded guilty to one count of having sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 14 years.

He admitted that, in February this year, he had sex with the girl, 13, following an all-ages party in the city.

Huerta had met the girl earlier that month at Marble Bar, sparking sexually-explicit Facebook interactions during which she claimed she was 14 years old.

Do you think our children fully understand that underage sex is a serious crime?

In the transcript viewed by The Advertiser, the court was told the girl dressed “like a 23-year-old” and “presented herself as a woman”, attending bars and events she could not lawfully enter.

“This is a girl who was not a girl who was sitting at home just putting Barbie dolls away,” Judge Davey said.

“This is a girl who was out there wanting to party and mix with older people, who put herself out there.”

The transcript records the fact a school class was sitting in the court’s public gallery as sentencing submissions were heard.

Lawyers for Huerta said their client and the girl agreed to have sex — even though she could not lawfully consent, and he was aware of her youth — in his bed at his home.

Judge Davey said she doubted the school class in the gallery understood their burgeoning sexuality could lead to criminal charges.

“I’m not suggesting that it’s not a serious matter for a man, although he is a young man too, to have sexual intercourse with a person underage,” she said.

“I would like to do a straw poll of the young people sitting in court at the moment — I’m not going to — to find out how many of them realise it’s a serious crime to even have touching of the genital area under the age of 17.

“It’s just that I find it extraordinary that there’s never public discussion about (the fact) we have a whole generation of young people having sex ... which is a crime.”

In sentencing, Judge Davey told Huerta it was “a crazy mixed up world we live in”.

“The reason why the law is as it is, is to protect young people from themselves,” she said.

“Whilst the media and the world we live in might encourage young people to think they are in control of their bodies and their sexuality from a very young age, you know ... that with sexual development one does not necessarily have the maturity to make decisions about sexual intercourse at an early age.”

Judge Davey said Huerta’s offending was not predatory and that he was “deeply shocked, upset and contrite” about his actions.

She imposed a two-year jail term, suspended on condition of a two-year good behaviour bond.

“One of the reasons why I suspended the period of imprisonment is because I think it is most unlikely we’ll see you back here again,” she said.

“You have your whole life ahead of you. Be good.”

1172,pjrbu,"Let me start by giving you a little bit of history to the relationship I was in at the time. I started dating this girl in my senior year of University. Things hit off quickly. We spent almost every night together, and fell in love. After graduating, we both landed great jobs in the same town, and moved in together. I honestly can't describe how great things were. We had no debt, good savings, great jobs, and the relationship couldn't have been better. I knew she was the girl I wanted to marry less than a year after we started dating. My parents, who were divorced, were very outspoken about not rushing into marriage, which is why I hadn't yet proposed 3 years in.

This girl was my perfect match. We knew each other inside out, and would never get sick of one another. I would have done anything for this girl. We had tons of fun, lots of friends, and lots of money. Life was good.

If there is one area I wouldn't have described as perfect, it was our sex life. Don't get me wrong, we had great sex, but finishing was often disappointing for at least one of us. This was the problem (gets a little descriptive):

Whenever I would ""finish"" first, she would become upset and slightly frustrated. Most of us probably know the feeling of getting really close and not being able to get there, so I never really blamed her for that. Usually when this happened, she would become very self-pittying for about an hour, and we'd go to sleep on opposite sides of the bed. It's like she was deliberately trying to make me feel bad for not making sure she was taken care of. It's probably worth mentioning I'd usually offer to go down and finish her off, but that rarely had any effect. Anyways, this wouls usually last about an hour, she would calm down, and everything was always fine. 

Now, here's the flip side of the coin. Most nights I was actually able to make her come. After this happened, I'd continue, and I would say about 30% of the time, she would be in pain. i don't know how normal this is or why it happened, but I accepted it. In these instances, I'd have to stop. The difference is that, although I was usually extremely frustrated (and horny), I'd let her know that it was OK. She was usually frustrated with herself when this happened more than anything else, so I tried as best as I could to constrain my frustration and show her that she meant more to me than anything else. We'd cuddle and go to bed. 

This may not sound like a healthy sex life, I don't know, but to me it was a very minor detail in an otherwise amazing relationship. We still had lots of excellent sex, and we were both very happy with the way things were going.

So now to the night it happened. We had just gotten back from a 5 day trip to her parents' place, which meant no sex for those 5 days. When we got back, I was ready to fuck anything that moved (I was 24, and probably at my sexual peak). I had been letting her know since the night before just exactly what I was going to do to her when we got home.

So we got home, things started, and then something happened. She came first, and then started to have that very recognizable painful look on her face. Now in the past I was able to restrain my frustration in these circumstances, but this time I couldn't. I rolled off and over to my side of the bed. She could tell I was frustrated and wanted to talk about it. I obliged, and began to pour out how exactly I felt. The conversation was actually fairly well-spirited, but I was still frustrated. After a little bit, she asked me if I wanted to try and go at it again. Once more, I obliged. A few minutes in and the same thing happened, except this time, she put on clothes, stormed out of the room, and left.

I was completely shocked. I tried calling but got no answer. It was no more than 30 minutes later of constantly trying to reach her that the cops showed up. She'd told them I'd raped her.

I immediately went in to shock. It was the first time in 3 years I felt the girl of my dreams start to slip away. It seemed surreal. I felt helpless. I tried to reason with the cops (it seemed like my only option at the time), but that obviously had no effect. They took me in for questioning. I was later released on bail and moved in with my parents, but of course, with a trial pending.

For the next few months, everything just seemed like it was in a constant downhill spin. A local feminist group got hold of my girlfriend's story and came to her ""support"", although it seemed their main goal was to make my life a living hell. They found out where I worked, and it didn't take them long to make sure I was fired. At every court appearance, sure enough they were there to ridicule and taunt me for what I'd done, even though I maintained my innocence.

I considered suicide a few times. Ever since graduating, I had the perfect life planned. Get married, have kids, live the life.  I couldn't even imagine my life without her in it, or finding someone to replace her. I had no job, and even started to believe some of the things these people were telling me. I was a wreck. I was very fortunate to have a supportive family. They believed me and helped me through it, and that kept me alive.

As for the trial, I told my side of things, and her story was constantly changing, always getting closer and closer to my account, which never changed. Eventually, her story had changed so much that the judge no longer considered the event to be rape. I was acquitted, and life moved on. The feminist group was not pleased. They were convinced I was guilty and that my ex had somehow been ""emotionally manipulated into changing her story"", because apparantly she still had feelings for me. This is beside the fact that she hadn't talked to me since that fateful night. They continued to pester me and be a generally nuissance, but slowly faded away.

So now, 4 years later, I am again in a happy and trusting relationship. The best thing for me has been to realize how silly those feelings of ""I will never find someone to replace her"" were. I actually managed to find a new decent job during the trial, so yes I'm employed. I look back though, and still have no idea how I could have been so wrong or what the hell happened. She still won't talk to me (although admittedly I stopped trying long ago), and I haven't the slightest idea how things went from best to worst. To think I was going to marry this girl...

So there you have it. If you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.",1172,4.0,0.28369998931884766,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

RAPE in AMERICA: Decade by Decade

In the 50’s and 60’s, rape was rare, and what little there was was kept hushed up, swept under the rug, and never spoken about in polite company.

In the 70’s, there was a marked increase in both the frequency and the brutality of rape, coinciding with the start of the women’s movement. Although it may not have been a coincidence, but rather the natural reaction of men unhappy with women demanding more and more rights, and wanting to “put them back in their place”. In this pre-DNA era, a rapist’s best chance of getting away with his horrible crime was to do away with the only witness/evidence in such a way that her body would not be located for an extended period of time. Countless attractive young women lost their lives to serial rapist/killers during this decade.

In the 80’s, the feminist movement doubled-down, working hard to stretch the definition of rape to include acquaintance rape, date rape, and even spousal rape. They not only insisted that these assaults be prosecuted just as vigorously and punished just as harshly as the most violent stranger-rapes, but they began demanding a lower standard of proof: A woman’s word alone, with no collaborating evidence at all, should be enough to send any man to prison forever, while new “rape shield laws” prevented him from confronting his accuser by delving into her past or questioning any contributing factors on her part that may have led the man to believe that “she wanted it.”

By the 1990’s, the new science of DNA had burst on to the scene, promising an end to the widespread scourge of unpunished rapes. But a funny thing happened on the way to ending injustice: The double-edged sword of DNA began proving—conclusively—something that most people had never even suspected: Women had been lying about rape. Frequently. And for the most trivial of reasons. Or for no reason what-so-ever. Or for reasons that were shockingly cruel and evil. And thousands of innocent me, who had been paying the price rotting in prison for crimes they didn’t commit, were now on the road to being exonerated.

By the turn of the century, actual rapists had a brand new, and rock solid defense. DNA had taken the “who-dun-it” out of rape cases, so now, every defendant’s plea became “it was consensual.” And every prosecutor’s trump cards, “women never lie about rape” or “why on Earth would she lie”? has been so thoroughly destroyed by the revelations of DNA that they dare not even utter those words in court, lest the defense bring up 1,000 counter-examples. A jury, playing by the rules, must acquit. Every time.

Now, nearly half-way through the 2010 decade, rape is more popular than ever. It’s becoming the great American pastime. Potential rapists are springing up like mushrooms, contemplating rape and prosecution, and saying “I like my odds!” while feminists are pulling their hair out (and with equal fervor, NOT pulling their hair out), making increasingly insane demands to weaken the Constitutional Rights of defendants, which even if enacted, would just result in more innocent men being punished and then exonerated, which in turn would create an even greater backlash from the jury pool.

The moral of all of this is, of course, that DNA science could have—and would have—solved the rape problem, had women been living up to their pre-supposed virtue of truthfulness. DNA + women not lying about rape = a death blow to rapists (and even the eventual elimination of the rape gene from the gene pool). Instead, feminists sought UNequal justice for women while trying to keep the power of the nuclear option of being able to falsely accuse men of rape when necessary.

So now, and in decades to come, we will surely see the day when the feminist-created, made-up statistics of “1 in 4” and “every 6 minutes” will become a reality. A reality that could have been different, had feminism truly embraced the concept of EQUAL rights, and justice for ALL.

>Feminism is becoming a bad word, but it's just a word. It's not really important to reclaim that word.

You're right, but it is important to differentiate [what I call feminism] from what [people here tend to call feminism]. The words, as you say, aren't really important. I was wrong to stress that they were. The reason it's important to make this distinction is that people here read all of the negative things about ""feminism"" and get a seriously misguided world-view. This world-view is

1. Harmful to our cause of men's rights activism

2. Potentially harmful to some of our relationships with women

and should therefore be refined to reflect the truth: that what we call ""feminism"" here is often just a group of anti-man, female-supriority activism. It is not the whole picture, even though it's easy to assume that it is.

This is the essence of my argument as it stands, refined by the criticisms I have received here.

----------
Another edit: if you are a newcomer to this thread and think what I'm saying is total garbage, please read the comments.

EDIT: I'm being downvoted because I'm being misunderstood. Many have made the entirely legitimate argument that **what everybody calls feminism is feminism**, and what authority do I have to say what it ""really is?"" 
First of all, this is like saying a bunch of kids who learn 4 chords on the guitar to impress their friends ""guitarists."" They can call themselves guitarists all they want, **and they would be wrong**. Perhaps ""philosopher"" is a better example: you can come up with bullshit all day about the meaning of life or whatever, but that doesn't make you a philosopher.

If you want to use ""feminism"" to describe the hateful and anti-man efforts of one group of women, then that's fine. But the links below are the real deal. The professionals. If you're still hung up on the word though, just call what I'm talking about something else!! What I'm trying to highlight is a conceptual distinction.

-----------------------------

Many of us, indignant about the disgusting assaults on the freedoms and equality of men, see ""feminism"" as the perpetrator. The reason for this is that the women (and men) who promote anti-man attitudes use this word to describe themselves--they call themselves ""feminists."" In many cases, they're wrong. 

It takes more than being anti-man to be feminist. It takes more than being *pro-woman* to be feminist. So many women who think they're feminists are just playing the vicious and self-defeating game of identity politics. Feminism is not just civil rights--it requires an appreciation of the social construction of gender, the institutional structure of oppression, and the psychological nature of the relationship between men and women. Furthermore, you're not a feminist if all you do is whine--just like you're not civil rights activist if you think black people are nice--true feminists will *act* to promote equality, and often this means going against the grain of what is standard and normative for their gender. That's why there are comparatively few actual feminists, compared to what you might first assume. 
 
Finally, people misunderstand ""equality,"" the goal of feminism. Equality does not mean equal circumstances and treatment all the time. Men and women are *biologically different*, and will always have different personalities, different desires/needs, and different roles in society. **Gender equality means that both genders are able to live their own lives to the fullest extent, freely and authentically.**

Here are some links for reference. 

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-approaches/

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism

Finally, in the name of good intellectual habits, if you think this is all wrong, *please say why*. I'll admit I'm wrong if it is demonstrated that I am. No issue is black and white, and I've glossed over a great deal of intricacy here.

I went to the gym this morning and saw this:

http://i.imgur.com/nVcRP.jpg

The gym in my building has been overly biased towards women for a while now. [1]

There tons of aerobic nautilus equipment.  There are three treadmills and four stair climbers.  All the machines are the mechanical (non-free weight).  And the only alternative if they remove the bench press is a smith machine (which have been shown to cause injuries and be less effective than the bench press).

    http://thewaronbullshit.com/2009/09/21/dangerous_exercise_machines/

The dumbells max out at 30 lbs.  There is no squat rack and originally there was NO bench press but another male in the building offered to donate one.

Further, there have been issues with the bench press before.  The incline press causes the bench to shift dangerously.  I've brought this up to the HOA only to be ignored.

I've been trying to work with our HOA for a while now and offered to by a squat rack but was ignored by the HOA for 4 months before giving up.

NOW they want to remove the LAST piece of gym equipment usable for men.  

I think part of this is that the HOA is getting bad advice but they don't seem to want to listen to any external advice other than those on the HOA board and their exercise machine vendors.

There was a gentleman at the gym who I brought this up with and he 100% agreed with me on all these issues.

I'm 90% certain they are just going to ignore me when I bring this to the attention of the HOA.  Men are 50% of the building and should receive 50% of the resources.  

1. I have NO PROBLEM sharing the gym with women.  If the situation were reversed I would fight for it to be fair for them too.

1181,zweel,"I got into an argument recently here on reddit with a user named felltir (perhaps this person was a troll...judging by the name, it's not an outlandish theory) but it got me to thinking about something...Feminists often claim sexual harassment is such a problem for women, and when I say harassment I am not talking about assault or rape (so those statistics which supposedly prove that assault and rape are not correlated with what women wear are a response to a straw man argument which I am not making)...In any case, feminists indeed make this claim and many women do as well.  So we have that.

Now, if you look at any woman in the subway or passing you in the street you will find that women **relative to men** wear clothing which is far more revealing than men do.  Most men wear collared shirts, a pair of gray pants or loose fitting blue jeans and shoes or boots, perhaps a jacket or an overcoat...something simple and anonymous...Women in contrast wear clothing that men would feel utterly ashamed to wear, like booty shorts and skin tight t-shirts with high sleeves (designed to show off even more skin) and women spend far more time concerned with their appearance.  Aside from rock & roll musicians, women seem to be the only ones who wear things like skin tight leather pants and short skirts...Men simply do not do this.

Now, if we put this together we have a situation where something doesn't add up.  If women were truly sexually harassed to a point where this were a major problem for them (relative to men), the market would dictate that we would find the situation to be completely the opposite...Women would be dressing in far more conservative clothing (relative to men), to ward off this truly problematic harassment.

But here we have the complete reverse taking place...We have women claiming sexual harassment is such a major problem and yet we also have women choosing of their own accord to wear far more revealing clothing.

The same is true of feminists who claim women are overly ""objectified"" and that this is problematic for women.  If it truly were problematic for women, why do they select clothing which objectifies their own bodies?

Now...before anyone straw mans me and says I'm saying women should cover up, I challenge you to point to a section of my text where I said that.  I did not say that.  My statement is simply that if sexual harassment were such a problem, relative to men, we would see women more covered up, relative to men.

The only explanation for this is that the benefits of women objectifying themselves and of women revealing skin and wearing skin tight clothing (narcissism, control over men, personal exaltation) outweighs the potential costs (harassment, such as whistling or comments)...

And anyone who thinks harassment has no correlation with how women dress is a completely deluded moron who I will not have any discussion with.  If you are so far out there that you think how a woman dresses doesn't effect her odds of being harassed you are an idiot.  

Now, I truly do believe sexual harassment is a problem for women, but perhaps it's because they are dressing in such a way as to provoke the response.

Enter sex positive feminist and their ""slut walks"", the complaint that it's not a woman's fault that she wears revealing clothing and is harassed, it's the harasser.  See, here we have an instance of feminists throwing gasoline on the flames they themselves are claiming to want to put out.

But isn't this a cryptic straw man?  It's not like preventing women from wearing overly sexual clothing and asking them to take responsibility for their actions is something which society doesn't expect of men.  If I wore booty shorts and went on the subway and I was harassed, it would be obviously because I am wearing such revealing clothing.  If you think about it, these types of slut walks are not an issue of equality...Are they fighting to be able to do something men can do and they can't?  No.  Men don't walk around in booty shorts, free of harassment.

But this is, for the most part, a free market, and it's a reflection of our values. So, if it is true that more women are being harassed than men and it is true that more women specifically choose to appear this way, it follows that whatever cost the sexual harassment has, the benefits outweigh the costs, at least relative to men.

1183,14333i,"Girl here. Drunk and waiting for a hot pocket to cook. Still I have a few questions. Not trying to be a jerk, sincerely curious about your guys' perspectives. 

Clearly men have more rights than women, maybe you guys don't think so, I don't know... (Although I think there are obviously double standards, different ones for both men and women. Women are called sluts when they sleep around and people always act like all men are potential rapists, etc.) Anywho, I get the feeling mens rights advocates (talking about in general here, not specifically this subreddit, as I haven't extensively read it) blame their problems on women. I see this as silly. Women aren't actively working against men's rights, they're fucking oppressed as it is! **I think when men's rights are impeded upon, it is due to the same system that gets in the way of women's rights.** For example, courts overwhelmingly favor mothers when determining who kids will live with during custody/divorce cases without regard to how good a father the husband is. I don't think this is fair, but I also don't think it's  the fault of women. The same social system that says women are caring, feminine, and good nuturers also paints men as uncaring, lacking emotionally, and not responsible for they're children's development. Who do you think the judge is going to assign custody of the children to with this model of thinking?! **I think men and women are both oppressed by the same system, what do you guys think? Agree or no?**

Edit: Okay, nobody seemed to respond to my most pertinent question, so I bolded it. Like I said, I think men and women are screwed over by the same system, but in different ways. Men are supposed to be masculine as possible and dominant in order to gain access to power in society. Part of this script involves creating a story about how males are 'invincible', when in reality they are not. That's when you start to see men being ignored as a group in healthcare because they don't ""need"" it. On the other hand, as a society we have this preoccupation with taking care of women because we see them as 'weak' and in need of healthcare. I also tried to make a point earlier about the child custody. Women are viewed as caretakers, men aren't. It's only logical for someone who holds such a belief system to give custody to women (not saying it's fair). Also, someone mentioned higher arrests and whatnot for men. Again, women are viewed as weak and non-threatening. Men are viewed as the violent and powerful ones, as persons who actually are threatening and need to be put in jail. Basically, what I'm trying to point out with the above examples is that I think the disparity in treatment we see between men and women all stems from our current beliefs about the ""natural"" behaviors of men and women. I also think all of that so-called difference is pretty much utter bullshit. Men need healthcare just as much as women, men can be just as good of parents, women should be punished just as equally as their male-counterparts for committing the same crime, and so on. The thing that you guys seem to be missing the point of is that *women aren't doing this to men, men are doing it to themselves*. The president is a male. Congress is mostly male. Police officers are mostly male. Court Judges are mostly male. Most positions of power in our society are overwhelmingly held by men. Why then, are men still being denied their rights? It's because these same men are 'trying' to maintain male dominated power structures that rely on men being treated in such ways. (I don't mean consciously trying, it is just the way things are, and women are also guilty of enforcing the same systems when able to do so.) 

To the person who questions that women actually have less rights then men--you've got to be kidding me. Would you also maintain that racism is a thing of the past? While women are quite equal to men in a legal sense, that is about as equal as it gets. I think I phrased it poorly using the word ""rights,"" but women do not have near as much access to power as men. Men dominate positions of power in our society, and it is **not** because they actually deserve to be there more than women. Women get paid less than men for the doing the same jobs with the exact same qualifications. Somehow, women's work is inherently worth less then men's work. I could provide other examples, but there is no point, I am not trying to prove which sex has it worse in society. Men and women need to work together to fix a social system that has oppressed both in different ways. But really, can't anyone here see the fucking contradiction in men's lack of rights and males occupying positions of power that also cause these lack of rights?! 

Sorry. I am tired and want to go to bed, but I appreciate the replies. I hope I didn't come off as too judgey, but it really worries me when I hear people blaming feminism or women for men's lack of rights. That's bullshit.

1185,15gxxd,"Disclaimer: I'm an anti-feminist, not MRA.  So I know some of you hate anything ""aggressive"" sourced from an MRA.  Well this isn't, but it's true anyway.

Seems we have posts all the time asking why feminists and MRAs can't get along.  These people don't understand that feminism is directly opposed to equality and men's rights.  But what if that were not true?  What if one day a miracle happened and every single feminist out there suddenly had a Road to Damascus experience and realised they needed to quit hating men, and spreading lies about men, and creating discrimination against men?

It wouldn't change a thing about the movement, and here's why.

As MRAs begin to get their message out, ordinary men are beginning to realise the situation of oppression that they are in.  They might not use that word but they are realising more and more that all this stuff about women being oppressed and men being assholes is all bullshit.  They are realising that it's usually men who get the shaft, not women.  Women get lifted up.  And they realise that society is lying about all this.   

What is their reaction?  They are angry.  They are going to be pissed off.  Probably they will be angry with women in general, which is bad, and misdirected, and something MRAs need to try to carefully reduce.  But certainly they will be angry at feminism, and that anger is actually accurate and the truth and will make them stronger for it.

But it does mean that feminism has to die.  Because if these men realise their situation and then see MRAs making kissy with feminists they will simply disregard the MRAs too.  Feminism's reputation is already too embedded and mixed up with women only and anti-male.  The MRAs are not well known.  If our society even tries to let feminism off the hook for all the evil it has done, men will _CORRECTLY_ see this as society being complacent still about anti-male behaviour.

They will _CORRECTLY_ see it as just one more example of how ""women"" can attack men and never get called to account.

There must be an accounting.  So EVEN IF every feminist suddenly stopped hating men their movement must be destroyed (publicly repudiated and called a hate movement) so that men and young men especially can see this and be satisfied that finally there has been an accounting.  Only then can they accept that society is maybe changing.

And frankly?  If any feminist ever really did change then **they would be the first to say this** and understand that they cannot change their ways and stay within the feminist movement.  **Any time you see a feminist who claims to ""get it"" about men but is still a feminist -- they don't get it**.  They don't get it and they think their crimes and the crimes of their movement are very minor at worst and can be swept under the rug and get back to business as usual.  They are more interested in saving their own skin than in addressing the inequalities they created.

Basically, in a conversation regarding drunk people fucking, and men being de facto ""rapists"", a feminist questioned why any man would be willing to have sex with any woman who said anything other than ""YES YES PLEASE!"", and insinuated that she was shocked that so many men would admit that they're basically rapists.

You like chocolate, right?  Of course you do, everyone does.  If someone offered you some chocolate, you would eat it, right?  Would you only eat it if that person were manic and virtually shoving the chocolate in your face as they screamed ""EAT EAT PLEASE!!!""?  What if they opened up the box of chocolate, and only reluctantly offered it to you?  Would you turn it down?  What if you asked for the chocolate, and they just opened the box, and motioned for you to take some, but didn't seem to give a fuck?  Would you refuse that chocolate because they weren't ridiculously enthusiastic about you eating some?  What if you met them at a bar, and the two of you were drinking, but they were REALLY enthusiastic about it all?

Now, imagine your desire for that chocolate is MUCH stronger.  In fact, it's foundational to nearly everything about you...and your gender.  Imagine simply hearing or seeing things somehow *related* to chocolate, can stir up a hunger within you equivalent to the hunger of a starving person who hasn't eaten a real meal in years.  Of course, as you mature, your desire for chocolate gets more subdued and nuanced, but when you're younger, especially when you just start eating chocolate, the desire for chocolate can be pretty extreme, and can undermine your judgment.

Add to that a society which has all sorts of rules, regulations, and social conventions surrounding how chocolate should be eaten and procured.  Most of them make sense to you...don't accept chocolate from a kid, don't steal it from people, don't coerce people into ""giving"" you chocolate against their will.  But some of them are asinine: you shouldn't eat chocolate with socks on, you shouldn't directly ask for chocolate, men shouldn't share chocolate, etc.  More than that, now you have some people called chocolatists who want even stricter rules.  They tell you that you're basically a criminal who should be locked up because you would accept chocolate from someone who offered it to you when you were both drunk.  They insinuate that you're responsible for the other person's actions AND your own, but that they're not responsible for any actions whatsoever.  They claim it has to do with someone being drunk and being incapable of giving consent to chocolate-sharing.  But in the hypothetical situation, you're both drunk...and they're only blaming you.  When you point out that you disagree, they start insisting that, because you say you *would* accept chocolate even if the person wasn't jumping around like an idiot trying to shove it in your face, you're a horrible person, on par with those who steal someone's chocolate when they're passed out...or those who beat people up to take their chocolate, etc.

A long time ago, some religious people passed laws making it illegal for people to buy chocolate.  Most reasonable people now seem to agree that two consenting adults should be able to sell and buy chocolate from one another...but many of the chocolatists do not.  In fact, they equate buying chocolate with kidnapping people, abusing them, and forcing them to sell chocolate for you under threat of death.  They ignore all the people who currently sell chocolate (illegally) without being coerced, etc.  Aside from that, some chocolatists actually try to outlaw DEPICTIONS of chocolate.  They claim it's also on par with forcing people to sell chocolate against their will, etc.  More than that, many chocolatists also fight for crazy laws...laws which throw out the presumption of innocence (the bedrock of our entire legal system) when chocolate-theft is alleged.  

The thing is, in this world, only gender-A has a natural source of chocolate...gender-B must procure it from gender-A.  So when they fight for some of these crazy laws, they actually fight for legislative gender-inequality.   You look into a lot of their literature...and see much of it holds up gender-A as being inherently superior, but also perpetually victimized, and it holds up gender-B as being inherently inferior, but also perpetually victimizing.  It looks sexist to you...so you call it sexism.  But they have an answer to that.  Instead of denying the idea that they're bigoted against gender-B, they point you to a special definition of ""[sexism](https://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/category/gender/sexism/)"" they're written, which claims it's impossible for gender-A to be sexist against gender-B, but not the other way around...that's right, their definition of sexism is, itself, sexist.

So you facepalm and walk away...unsure of how people could be THIS far off base.  The most fucked up thing of all?  Chocolatism has been embraced, at least superficially, by the mainstream.  These people are actually respected by your society...at least superficially (i.e. people pay them lip-service out of fear).",1186,4.0,0.2849000096321106,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first"

1190,iytoo,"Wrote this essay previously, in a fit of frustration with what I see in the West, so I've copied and pasted. Hope that's ok.

For all the talk about “girl power” and “women kicking ass” which you see on movies these days, if the men of your “tribe” are too weak or demoralised to protect you, you will be enslaved and crushed by the men from other “tribes” before you can say “Vagina Monologues”. Which means that if you break down men’s masculinity, their willingness and ability to defend themselves and their families, you destroy the country. That’s exactly what Western women have done for the last forty years. ….

The male protective instinct doesn’t take action because Scandinavian women have worked tirelessly to eradicate it, together with everything else that smacks of traditional masculinity. Because of this feminism has greatly weakened  Western civilisation as whole. …

Didn’t feminists always claim that the world would be a better place with women in the driver’s seat, because they wouldn’t sacrifice their own children? Well, isn’t that exactly what they are doing now? 

Misandry, the hatred of men, isn’t necessarily less prevalent than misogyny, the hatred of women. The difference is that the former is much more socially acceptable.

If all oppression comes from Western men, it becomes logical to try weakening them as much as possible. If you do, a paradise of peace and equality awaits us at the other side of the rainbow. Well congratulations to Western women. You’ve succeeded in harassing and ridiculing your own sons into suppressing many of their masculine instincts. To your surprise, you didn’t enter a feminist Nirvana, but paved the way for an unfolding hell. ….

Feminists claim that the reason why women haven’t been as numerous in politics and science as men is due to male oppression of women. Some of this is true. But it is not the whole story. Being male means having to prove something, to achieve something, in a greater way than it does for women. In addition to this, the responsibility for child rearing will always fall more heavily on women than on men. ….

it was in fact the women who started this whole “single is best” culture that now permeates much of the West. Since women initiate most divorces and a divorce can potentially mean financial ruin for a man, it shouldn’t really be too surprising that many men hesitate to get involved at all. … At the same time, women during the past few decades have made it a lot easier to have a girlfriend without getting married. So women make it riskier to get married and easier to stay unmarried, and then they wonder why men “won’t commit?” Maybe too many women didn’t think all this feminism stuff quite through before jumping on the bandwagon? …..

The elaborate welfare state model in the West is frequently labelled as “the nanny state,” but perhaps it could also be named “the husband state.” Why? Well, in a traditional society, the role of men and husbands is to physically protect and financially provide for their women. In our modern society, part of this task has simply been “outsourced” to the state, which helps explain why women in general give a disproportionate support to high taxation and pro-welfare state parties. The state has simply become a substitute husband, upheld by taxation of their ex-husbands. ….

Radical feminism has bred suspicion and hostility, not cooperation. And what’s more, it has no in any way eradicated the basic sexual attraction between feminine women and masculine men. If people do not find this in their own country, they travel to another country or culture to find it, which in our age of globalisation is easier than ever. A striking number of Western men find their wives in East Asia, Latin America or other nations with a more traditional view of femininity, and a number of women find partners from more conservative countries. …

radical feminism has been one of the most important causes of the current weakness of Western civilisation, both culturally and demographically. Feminists, often with a Marxist world view, have been a crucial component in establishing the suffocating public censorship of Political Correctness in Western nations. They have also severely weakened the Western family structure, and contributed to making the West too soft and self-loathing …

Well, after two generations of Second Wave Feminism, Ms. Willis and Ms. Beauvoir have had their way: The West has skyrocketing divorce rates and plummeting birth rates, leading to a cultural and demographic vacuum. And feminists still aren’t satisfied. ….

Feminists claim that women have been victims of men, that men have oppressed women for centuries and that the sexes are equal. Denying this will result in the smears “misogynist” and “male chauvinist pig”. But equalising the sexes has led to a crippling feminisation of Western society … portraying women as oppressed victims and the equals of males is one example of how the pursuit of equality is being used to destroy our society and undermine – and therefore be in conflict with – Mother nature. ….

1193,1tl6m1,"I'm getting *really* tired of hearing people talking about ""true feminists"" who ""really only fight for equal rights and don't hate men.""  

Firstly, let's talk about NAFALT.  It's rhetoric.  Of course not all feminists are fire-breathing monsters like Big Red.  But they are all still deluded into thinking feminism is still necessary and has anything to do with humanism.  

There are laws protecting women from unfair treatment in the workplace and proper treatment of women is now ubiquitous corporate policy.  The wage gap now favors women as does the education gap.  Women are snatching up expensive STEM education hand-over-fist (and pissing it down their legs, incidentally.)  And the courts both criminal and family think they are all innocent angels incapable of doing any wrong.  So they won.  They got what they wanted.  They are obsolete. 

 So at this point the only purpose of feminism is about getting more agency and privilege.  And I tell ya, if you think giving one group undeserved privileges doesn't compromise the rights of another group then you deserve what's coming to by way of your precious ""true feminism.""

So think about what you're supporting when you support a ""true"" feminist.

The thought of jail was too terrifying for me and I decided I was going to meet up with my girlfriend and string her along just long enough to avoid having her press charges.

Yesterday morning though, the police showed up at my apartment and arrested me. My gf told me she would wait until yesterday to give me enough time to decide before she called the cops, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised she screwed me over.

On my way out, I could see the police were talking to my neighbor. I have very thin walls and I'm terrified about what my neighbor might have heard.

I spent the night in jail, the worst nightmare I could ever imagine and the one thing I wanted to avoid more than anything else. I have a (male, thank god) public defender and my parents posted bail.

My mom isn't speaking with me. My dad says he is very disappointed in me. I could barely hold back my rage at them. I tried explaining how my girlfriend tried to IMPREGNATE herself against my will. How I had taken extreme (though justifiable) measures to stop this injustice, but they're so blinded by fucked up gender equality beliefs that they are turning against me, their own son.

Oh, also when I got home today I found an email from a summer job I really wanted saying I didn't get it. Is it related to this? Did my gf tell them I was arrested? I can't prove it, but I'm suspicious as hell.

I feel fucking destroyed reddit. My entire life is ruined by this lunatic and every single fucking person is against me. I'm hopeless for the first time in my life.

I'll never trust another person I date. I'm flushing every condom, I'm only using spermicidal lube. I'm even considering getting a vasectomy. 

I don't care if you believe me or not, I'm ready to accept I'm worthless garbage to society. To everyone who supported me, thank you, it means a lot. To everyone else, keep laughing and destroying me. Everything is so bleak, I just don't care how much you hate me.
