            "When I used to see my brother right after work on our way to dinner or a game, I had always noticed his tone was way different to how I always knew him. He would always come from work in his, as you described, and what I perceived as a Rapport Breaking attitude. That report breaking attitude used to really catch me off guard when I was not really primed and ready to handle it. Subconsciously it used to make me feel stupid, and very low, and when that stuff used to happen, I would get ANGRY. I would just have to bottle it up for the rest of the night, or on the lucky nights we were at a game, screamed as loud as I could at the ref or something, and that helped cope with it. This wasn’t only happening to me, my parents were also mentioning it as well. It reminded me of the way my father used to always speak to me, and his tones are EXTREME, and as an emotional child raised more by his mother, I didn’t get to understand the difference in them, he was just “nasty” to me. Plus having your mom force on you that your father is horrible and everything he says is evil and that adds another layer to it. That I have overcome, and doesn’t bother me at all. But that tone from my brother was jarring to me. \n",

            "I decided to speak to my brother about it, but made sure the setting was a Sunday night at dinner, where both our tones initially were on a neutral standpoint and he hadn’t come from work. When I was ready to talk to him about his tone, I went into a rapport breaking tone for sure. It caught him off guard and he wasn’t understanding it, and so he got very defensive. I’ve always been fantastic at diffusing tense situations because I tried to become the peacemaker growing up, so I quickly changed my tone and brought him back down with me. He actually had a moment of realization and felt really bad and wasn’t aware of the effect of the tone that he left work with had on anyone. I knew it really hit him because he went into a quite moment of reflection.\n",

Rapport neutral has elements of both 'seeking' and 'breaking.' It happens naturally, and your voice can raise up a little and drop a little as appropriate, otherwise you'll just come off as monotone.

Rapport neutral has elements of both 'seeking' and 'breaking.' It happens naturally, and your voice can raise up a little and drop a little as appropriate, otherwise you'll just come off as monotone.

A CEO of a company might speak that way to his employees as well. It commands respect. Think Leonidas in 300. When he addresses his army, he is Rapport Breaking.

No more bullshit excuses existed for them if they wanted to heal.   These women are masters of their lives, because they know deep deep down that the only way for them to get to where they want is to work for it.

If AWALT was a pile of shit, the vast majority of women would still be AWALT because of the instinctive behaviors of men. Also, the tendency for men to be more personally responsible than their female counterparts probably extends from the instinctive empathy gap. Nobody cares about men, so you either man up and do it yourself, or get your ass kicked the whole way.\n",

No more bullshit excuses existed for them if they wanted to heal.   These women are masters of their lives, because they know deep deep down that the only way for them to get to where they want is to work for it.

Also, the tendency for men to be more personally responsible than their female counterparts probably extends from the instinctive empathy gap.

            "\n",
            "There are two principles you can use to navigate these situations: \n",
            "\n",
            "1) Is what she is doing \"wrong\" according to YOUR rules? Different people can have different views as to what is moral and immoral, but what matters is what YOU have decided is right and wrong, not her. A lot of times when men are enamored with a woman, they let her dictate right and wrong to them, so they will say crazy shit like \"it's ok for her to go on vacation with her ex-boyfriend without me.\" \n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, it is your job to come up with an appealing set of rules and you need to do some deep thinking here. If your \"morality\" sucks and makes her miserable, she will leave. But women generally understand right and wrong, and they often shit test you by presenting you an immoral situation and seeing if you bite. For example, if a woman acts like she is entitled to do something that you are not allowed to do, it is perfectly in your rights to declare that as \"wrong.\" You can't let women warp your sense of morality. \n",
            "\n",
            "2) The second rule is \"don't do anything for her, including providing her attention, that she hasn't done for you.\" For example, let's go to the \"I was raped\" example in the article. Now, whether or not she was telling the truth, the fact is that you are not her therapist and if she has done nothing for you, you have no responsibility to comfort her or provide her free therapy for her rape. It is perfectly within your rights to change the subject, just like it would be in her rights to change the subject if you start complaining about the problems in your life. \n",
            "\n",
            "If, however, she has done a bunch of stuff for you, then it may be appropriate for you to comfort her on her problems and stuff. But even then you must use your judgment and not do anything for her she doesn't deserve. You will quickly  notice that women who have been doing stuff for you are less likely to do stupid shit like lie about getting raped. They have invested in you and they don't want to risk that.\n",

            "A step in practicing stoicism, one could say.\n",
            "REPLY: Yeah I agree.  Forgiveness is absolutely one of the most misunderstood concepts of today's world.  People are unable to give forgiveness to others or themselves because apologies themselves have become devalued.  Too many people have given token apologies because they want the benefits of being forgiven without legitimately meaning the apology.  Look no further than the fact that public relations is an actual industry; its sole purpose is building images of apologizing without apologizing and virtue signalling to look like they actually care about morality.  Apologies are so often artificially manufactured that granting forgiveness is now seen as an act of weakness and letting someone off without righteous punishment.  It's to the point today where one would be stupid to apologize for anything, because regardless if it is earnest or not, the other party will reject the apology, deny forgiveness, and hate on the apologizer twice as hard now that they have admitted they did wrong.\n",
            "\n",
            "The unwillingness to apologize or to forgive is extremely damaging to social well-being enough as it is, but it becomes nuclear when inwardly directed.  A lot of people will do something wrong that has damaged their own lives, they regret it, they inwardly apologize to themselves, but they cannot forgive themselves.  The social dysfunction turned inward, the wrongdoer will thrash themselves constantly for their fault, never letting up and never relenting, a kind of personal hell.  For, after all, are not words cheap?  It is easy to beg yourself for forgiveness, but what you really need is punishment.  How much punishment?  Well, as you are the unforgiving judge, there is no punishment enough, even for something that, in the grand scheme of things, is not that bad.  Even worse, the people who do something that damages their own lives and refuse to even apologize to themselves to save themselves from their internal punishment, never admitting fault and dooming themselves to forever repeating the same mistake, damaging their lives further and further while drowning in denial.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is the genius of such a huge part of Christianity.  Everyone is born into sin, so you go into the world expecting to see yourself and others fail when they ought not.  God is the ultimate judge, so you need not try to punish yourself or others above god, as it would be prideful to think you are capable of that.  As long as you follow the steps of confession, confession (informing someone else of your sin), contrition (earnestly wishing it had not occurred), then you will receive absolution because god is endlessly forgiving, even to murderers and rapists (theoretically).  Once absolved of sin by God himself, you are cleansed as if it had never happened, for he is the ultimate authority.\n",
            "\n",
            "Though I am an atheist, I've always considered this aspect of Christianity to be pure genius.  It creates a very rapid scaffold to acknowledge, judge, and absolve ourselves of faults in others and ourselves.  The fact that it is such a monolithic feature in Christianity should indicate just how important legitimate apologies and forgiveness are, and by corollary, how destructive it is to withhold apologies and forgiveness.\n",

            "Yeah I agree.  Forgiveness is absolutely one of the most misunderstood concepts of today's world.  People are unable to give forgiveness to others or themselves because apologies themselves have become devalued.  Too many people have given token apologies because they want the benefits of being forgiven without legitimately meaning the apology.  Look no further than the fact that public relations is an actual industry; its sole purpose is building images of apologizing without apologizing and virtue signalling to look like they actually care about morality.  Apologies are so often artificially manufactured that granting forgiveness is now seen as an act of weakness and letting someone off without righteous punishment.  It's to the point today where one would be stupid to apologize for anything, because regardless if it is earnest or not, the other party will reject the apology, deny forgiveness, and hate on the apologizer twice as hard now that they have admitted they did wrong.\n",
            "\n",
            "The unwillingness to apologize or to forgive is extremely damaging to social well-being enough as it is, but it becomes nuclear when inwardly directed.  A lot of people will do something wrong that has damaged their own lives, they regret it, they inwardly apologize to themselves, but they cannot forgive themselves.  The social dysfunction turned inward, the wrongdoer will thrash themselves constantly for their fault, never letting up and never relenting, a kind of personal hell.  For, after all, are not words cheap?  It is easy to beg yourself for forgiveness, but what you really need is punishment.  How much punishment?  Well, as you are the unforgiving judge, there is no punishment enough, even for something that, in the grand scheme of things, is not that bad.  Even worse, the people who do something that damages their own lives and refuse to even apologize to themselves to save themselves from their internal punishment, never admitting fault and dooming themselves to forever repeating the same mistake, damaging their lives further and further while drowning in denial.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is the genius of such a huge part of Christianity.  Everyone is born into sin, so you go into the world expecting to see yourself and others fail when they ought not.  God is the ultimate judge, so you need not try to punish yourself or others above god, as it would be prideful to think you are capable of that.  As long as you follow the steps of confession, confession (informing someone else of your sin), contrition (earnestly wishing it had not occurred), then you will receive absolution because god is endlessly forgiving, even to murderers and rapists (theoretically).  Once absolved of sin by God himself, you are cleansed as if it had never happened, for he is the ultimate authority.\n",
            "\n",
            "Though I am an atheist, I've always considered this aspect of Christianity to be pure genius.  It creates a very rapid scaffold to acknowledge, judge, and absolve ourselves of faults in others and ourselves.  The fact that it is such a monolithic feature in Christianity should indicate just how important legitimate apologies and forgiveness are, and by corollary, how destructive it is to withhold apologies and forgiveness.\n",
