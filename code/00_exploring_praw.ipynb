Bruce Lee was 5\"8 and 128 lbs. Nobody in their right mind would ever question his masculinity, because it's a widely accepted fact that Bruce Lee could knock the teeth out of your face with little to no effort. Masculinity is expressed as authority. Authority can be expressed with violence but that winds up being a slippery slope toward abuse due to lack of discipline. Power without discipline is the most direct path toward self ruin. Women often have a poor understanding of the concept of self discipline and rely on the man to guide her to make correct choices and decisions. Therefore Masculinity is more appropriately expressed as stoicism where men use self discipline to free themselves from the bonds of anger, envy, jealousy, and lust. All of these bonds serve to chain us to the system of control, and the status of Alpha by apparent definition transcends the system's control mechanisms. The Alpha does not chase women, they chase him. \n",
