## About this app

This dashboard allows you to explore a preliminary analysis of content from three Men's Rights Activist Reddit feeds: `r/TheRedPill`, `r/MGTOW` and `r/MensRights`. As the first two subreddits are quarantined, this app offers an avenue for anyone interested to learn more about the content of these feeds without directly interacting wiht the content itself.
