he said he was leaving her. I worked with a woman who impaled her husband in his sleep through the cheek with a pair of scissors because he said he was leaving her the next day.

I've left many a female I lived with and the best way to go about it is to go stealth. Plan 

everything out and don't say a word. 'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.' It's the truth, 

and for practical purposes women are basically above the law- white women especially. She can 

murder you and just claim 'abuse' like Mary Winkler did. They'll be arrested, but the punishment 

will be next to nothing, and women know this, which is why telling a woman you're leaving her is 

about the most dangerous thing you could ever do.

Last female I left was in 2006- she became psychotic and controlling after about a year- the usual- so I just started looking for another place to live, got the place, put down a deposit, took a day off while she was a work, got a Uhaul and moved everything out while she was gone. Of course she went nuts afterwards and started calling my work harassing me, and started the fake crying. I told her that she shouldn't have been such a monster of a human being, but of course she didn't learn anything as usual. She's still just a stupid bitch & the only companion suitable for her is a cat. If I had told her I was leaving there's a good chance I wouldn't be alive today.

Seems we have posts all the time asking why feminists and MRAs can't get along.  These people don't understand that feminism is directly opposed to equality and men's rights.  But what if that were not true?  What if one day a miracle happened and every single feminist out there suddenly had a Road to Damascus experience and realised they needed to quit hating men, and spreading lies about men, and creating discrimination against men?

It wouldn't change a thing about the movement, and here's why.

As MRAs begin to get their message out, ordinary men are beginning to realise the situation of oppression that they are in.  They might not use that word but they are realising more and more that all this stuff about women being oppressed and men being assholes is all bullshit.  They are realising that it's usually men who get the shaft, not women.  Women get lifted up.  And they realise that society is lying about all this.   

What is their reaction?  They are angry.  They are going to be pissed off.  Probably they will be angry with women in general, which is bad, and misdirected, and something MRAs need to try to carefully reduce.  But certainly they will be angry at feminism, and that anger is actually accurate and the truth and will make them stronger for it.

But it does mean that feminism has to die.  Because if these men realise their situation and then see MRAs making kissy with feminists they will simply disregard the MRAs too.  Feminism's reputation is already too embedded and mixed up with women only and anti-male.  The MRAs are not well known.  If our society even tries to let feminism off the hook for all the evil it has done, men will _CORRECTLY_ see this as society being complacent still about anti-male behaviour.

They will _CORRECTLY_ see it as just one more example of how ""women"" can attack men and never get called to account.

There must be an accounting.  So EVEN IF every feminist suddenly stopped hating men their movement must be destroyed (publicly repudiated and called a hate movement) so that men and young men especially can see this and be satisfied that finally there has been an accounting.  Only then can they accept that society is maybe changing.

And frankly?  If any feminist ever really did change then **they would be the first to say this** and understand that they cannot change their ways and stay within the feminist movement.  **Any time you see a feminist who claims to ""get it"" about men but is still a feminist -- they don't get it**.  They don't get it and they think their crimes and the crimes of their movement are very minor at worst and can be swept under the rug and get back to business as usual.  They are more interested in saving their own skin than in addressing the inequalities they created.

What's interesting is, in recent years the age at which the average person gets married has been ever increasing.

People get used to married right out of teenager hood at the young age of 20. Now people are waiting until they are 25. 

* Marriage Age Chart: http://i.imgur.com/xoYrpcZ.png

You would think people getting married older would lead to less divorce. However, I don't think age is necessarily linked to divorce, nor does it prevent divorce. At least, not in a way that is significant.

Rather the statistics show a few different connections:

* Women's Suffrage and cultural ""empowerment"" is tied to divorce.
* The divorce rate is directly tied to the marriage rate. 

Let's look at the statistics and history:

-------
United Kingdom
--------

* 1918 - In the UK Women's Suffrage was put in place. Women over the age of 30 were allowed to vote.
* 1928 - In the UK full Women's Suffrage was granted and any legal adult woman could vote. 

Now look at this chart and notice when divorce started spiking: ~1918

------
United States
------

* 1890 - The National Women Suffrage Association and the American Women Suffrage Association merge to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). As the movement's mainstream organization, NAWSA wages state-by-state campaigns to obtain voting rights for women.
* 1893 - Colorado is the first state to adopt an amendment granting women the right to vote. Utah and Idaho follow suit in 1896, Washington State in 1910, California in 1911, Oregon, Kansas, and Arizona in 1912, Alaska and Illinois in 1913, Montana and Nevada in 1914, New York in 1917; Michigan, South Dakota, and Oklahoma in 1918.
* 1913 - Alice Paul and Lucy Burns form the Congressional Union to work toward the passage of a federal amendment to give women the vote. The group is later renamed the National Women's Party. Members picket the White House and practice other forms of civil disobedience.
* 1919 - The federal woman suffrage amendment, originally written by Susan B. Anthony and introduced in Congress in 1878, is passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is then sent to the states for ratification.

Now look at this chart and see the first spike in divorce immediately following actions by Women's Suffrage, in particular 1920 right after national voting was allowed for women.

Both Marriage & Divorce now on the decline
----
Did the role reversal introduced by feminism lead to better and more successful marriages? And as shown here: http://i.imgur.com/NsDpdBE.png you'll see that roles haven't really reversed much at all. More couples have both partners working than ever before, but the number of couples where the woman becomes the breadwinner so the husband can stay home - hasn't increased. Role reversals and the ""stay-at-home-dad"" are fiction or fringe cases.

Co-habitation and No Union (niether living together or married) are on the rise. Marriage is now at an all time low per capita, and divorce is in decline, but I believe that is only because marriage is also.

This failure and lack of marriages however, is leading an entire generation of children being raised by a single parent - which results in lower quality children who turn out to be lower quality adults. [TheAtlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/03/the-decline-of-marriage-and-the-rise-of-unwed-mothers-an-economic-mystery/274111/) ran a piece on this not long ago. 

The other problem is that women don't want to marry men that are lower status than they are. [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/trevorbutterworth/2013/06/25/whats-behind-the-us-decline-in-marriage-pragmatism/) ran a piece on this without actually saying it too directly:
>All the talk of recession and culture and cohabitation and education is a way of avoiding talking about the economic collapse of an entire class of American male.

As a bonus, here's some information confirming ""The Wall."" Many more young women are not getting married, but older women are getting married about just as much even with the declining marriage rate.

>In recent years, there has been a growing difference in marriage rates by age and by ethnic group.6 Fewer and fewer women are marrying in their twenties. Among women 20 to 24 years of age in 1975, 63% had married, while in 1990, only 39% of women in the same age group had married. For women 25 to 29 years of age, these percentages dropped from 87% in 1975 to 69% in 1990; rates dropped from 93% to 82% for women 30 to 34, 96% to 89% for women 35 to 39, and from 96% to 92% for women 40 to 44.

[The Wall for divorcees](http://futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=63&articleid=408&sectionid=2781): 

>Younger women are more likely than older women to remarry, but age is not associated with remarriage among men.

---------------

So how is this last part all related to women voting? Well it isn't directly. But it is related to something similar. Women's cultural influence and social power.

* Under the presidency of Bill Clinton, women won many wars on the home front. The Violence Against Women Act and the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (FACE) were both passed; and women began earning 71 cents for every dollar paid to men, a substantive increase from the decade before. Carol Moseley Braun became the first African American woman elected to the U.S. Senate; Janet Reno became U.S. Attorney General; and Madeleine Albright was appointed the first female U.S. Secretary of State, making her the highest-ranking woman in the United States government.
* While internationally, women were rising to Heads of State at lightning speed with France, Bangladesh, Canada, Turkey, and New Zealand all electing their first female prime ministers.
* 2000-2005 - Several countries granted voting rights to women for the first time, including Kuwait and Bahrain, and elected women to the highest ranks of state—among the most notable was the election of Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf to president of Liberia, making her Africa's first elected female leader. In Germany, Angela Merkel became the country's first female chancellor; Michelle Bachelet was sworn in as Chile's first female president; and in the U.S., Condoleezza Rice became the first woman to serve as U.S. National Security Advisor.
* 2006 - Nancy Pelosi was the first woman elected Speaker of the House in the U.S. House of Representatives, which places her just two seats from the presidency.

So far, since women have started entering official government positions, the only thing that the government has accomplished is marriage for gays and the outlaw of polygamy:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_civil_marriage_in_the_United_States  
While same-sex marriage was an admirable ideal, it only helps out a minority. Nothing has been done in the last decade to support the majority of the population in fixing the decline of straight marriage. The polygamy issue was at worst a red herring, and I can't see why anyone would focus on legislation for that when there are actual problems to solve.

Further [*this*](http://dontmarry.wordpress.com/) is the legal and cultural climate that men who engage in marriage have to deal with today. All thanks to ""empowered"" women. 

In conclusion, Women's Suffrage was the beginning of the end of marriage. In the mid and late 1800s before women could vote, the divorce rate was nearly non-existent. As female influence increased, the divorce rate increased. It reached a peak in 1979 and hasn't come down any quicker than the marriage rate has since.

Firstly, let's talk about NAFALT.  It's rhetoric.  Of course not all feminists are fire-breathing monsters like Big Red.  But they are all still deluded into thinking feminism is still necessary and has anything to do with humanism.  

There are laws protecting women from unfair treatment in the workplace and proper treatment of women is now ubiquitous corporate policy.  The wage gap now favors women as does the education gap.  Women are snatching up expensive STEM education hand-over-fist (and pissing it down their legs, incidentally.)  And the courts both criminal and family think they are all innocent angels incapable of doing any wrong.  So they won.  They got what they wanted.  They are obsolete. 

 So at this point the only purpose of feminism is about getting more agency and privilege.  And I tell ya, if you think giving one group undeserved privileges doesn't compromise the rights of another group then you deserve what's coming to by way of your precious ""true feminism.""

So think about what you're supporting when you support a ""true"" feminist.

""My step-daughter wants her ""Real Dad"" to give her away""

My step-daughter will be getting married on August 3rd. The wedding planning has consumed most of her and her mother's life (I say her mother because we aren't married, though we've lived together for 10 years) for the past six months.

My step-daughter graduated last December from University. I paid for her to go to college, though it was a state school, it still ran $40K. She does not have a job and has been living with us for the duration of her college career and since her graduation. I also bought her a car to get back and forth from school when she finished high school.

From time to time her deadbeat father would pop into her life and she would fawn all over him. Although he has not contributed a cent to her education or paid any child support, though that is my girlfriend's fault as c.s. was not part of the settlement, she still loves him and wants him in her life. He stays long enough to break her heart by skipping town and breaking some promise that he made her.

The wedding venue holds 250 people max. I gave them a list of 20 people that I wanted invited, you know, since I was paying for everything. They told me that was no problem and they'd take care of it. So I let these people know they'd be getting an invite and they should save the date. Saturday, I saw one of my friends on this list at the golf course and asked if he was coming. He told me that he wasn't invited. He told me that he got an announcement, but not an invitation. He had it in his back seat (along with probably six months of mail) and showed it to me. Sure enough, it was just an announcement, and my name was nowhere on it. It had her dad's name and her mom's name and not mine.

This led to a pretty big fight with my GF, as I found out that NONE of my list of twenty ""made the cut"" for the final guest list because ""250 people is very tight."" I was pissed, but not a hell of a lot I could do because the important people in my life had already been offended. My GF said ""if some people didn't rsvp yes, I might be able to get a couple people in."" But that is an ultimate slap in the face in my opinion. So, I was boiling on Saturday.

Yesterday, we had a Sunday dinner with the future in-law's family and us and a surprise guest, the ""Real Dad."" At this little dinner my step-daughter announced that her ""Real Dad"" was going to be able to make it to her wedding and that now he'd be able to give her away. This was greeted with a chorus of ""Oh how great"" and ""How wonderful""s.

I don't think I have ever felt so angry and so disrespected. I was shaking. I took a few seconds to gather my composure, because I honestly wasn't sure if I would cry or start throwing punches or both. Once I was sure I'd be able to speak I got up from my chair and said I'd like to make a toast. I can't remember exactly what I said but the gist of it was this:

""I'd like to make a toast."" The sound of spoons against glasses ring in my years. ""It has been my great pleasure to be a part of this family for the past ten years."" Awe, how sweet. ""At this point in my life I feel I owe a debt of gratitude to bride and groom, because they have opened my eyes to something very important."" Confident smiles exchanged. ""They have showed me that my position in this family is not what I once thought it was."" And now a glimmer of confusion and shock begins to spread on the faces in the room. ""Though I once thought of myself as the patriarch or godfather of the family, commanding great respect and sought out for help in times of need, it seems instead that I hold the position of an ATM, good for a stream of money, but not much else. As I have been replaced as host, both on the invitations and in the ceremony, I am resigning my financial duties as host to my successor, Real Dad. So cheers to the happy couple and the path they have chosen."" I finished my drink. ""You all can let yourselves out.""

Is this selfish? I'm supposed to shell out 40 - 50 grand for a wedding that I can't invite anyone to? That I am not a part of? I'm so done with this crap. I'm done with my step-daughter, I'm done with my GF. I transferred the money out of our joint account last night. (she has not had a job since she moved in with me) This morning I called all the vendors I had written checks to for deposits to refund my money. At present it looks like I'll lose around 1500, for the venue, but the other vendors have been great about refunding.

TLDR: You want your ""REAL DAD"" to be on the invitation, to give you away and to sit at the head table, fine, your ""REAL DAD"" can pay for everything too.

EDIT: The immediate aftermath was tantrum and people sitting there mumbling while not actually saying anything to me, but to each other. After much yelling with the GF about me being selfish, I spent the night in my home office and no one knocked on my door, not once. Today's aftermath is kind of depressing for me. GF brought me Bride's wedding planner to show me how much work I was ruining. I thumbed through it, found a page in the music section for Father / Daughter dances. All of the songs were catered to Real Dad's taste. So I thought they were just being disrespectful, but now I'm feeling like they never really gave a crap at all, especially since the menu included two ingredients I'm allergic to, that actually made me laugh. Either way, I'm glad to be done, returned the planner and asked her when she and bride could move out. Also, I never promised to pay for the wedding. I offered them the use of my home when they were sure it was going to be small, but other than that, all I've heard is how it's the Bride's family that should pay, so, let it be the bride's family then, aka, not me.

EDIT: June 9th 1:15 am. Girlfriend and Bride are now moved out. They are moving in with the groom. It was very hard not to be petty with some of the ""belongings"" they took with them, but it's done and I switched out the locks and now it's time for a brew. I can't believe how popular this story got, but I feel good to be given support by so many. If I find out what happens with the wedding, I will let you know, but I can't guarantee that I will put in the effort to find out. From what I've heard they are trying to ""scale things back"" and get his parents to help out. GF burned bridges when I found out she tried to write herself a check on our joint account the day after the unpleasantness. By then I had already moved money, so I guess I'm a bigger ass than her, but I could feel it coming. That's all.

What truth? The red pill truth! 

**SPOILERS AHEAD**

I've read every book, and they've provided useful insight into relationships. In the first scene, Bella (the main character), moves to a rainy town in Washington state. Right off the bat, she gets a beta orbiter, Tyler. She's immediately not attracted to him, and friendzones him. But next, she spies Edward, who she notices has a dark triad complex. Seriously, he's attractive, muscular, and most importantly, is rich as fuck.

He drives a Volkswagen to school. Lots of social status here! She starts becoming infatuated with him when Tyler almost hits her with his van, and Edward saves her using his incredible muscles. He leaves, (dread game time), pretty much ignoring her for huge amounts of time. Edward actually starts stalking her around at this point, watching her sleep. Yet she doesn't view him as a creep, (because of all of his alphaness) and proceeds to date him.

She clings to Edward for emotionally support throughout the series, attracted to the danger of him being a vampire. James, however, comes in, wanting to hunt Bella. He's the beta orbiter stereotype right there, no status, nowhere near as attractive and muscular. Constantly stalking her around, no life of his own. James is what not do be, he pretty much pedastalizes her as the ""perfect game"". 

James steals Bella, and then gets killed by Edward, who saves her. This part isn't very important, but the next book is a study of AFBB.

Bella gets a paper cut in New Moon at her birthday party (the book after Twilight), causing a vampire to try to attack her. Edward and the rest of his family move away now, because it's really dangerous if a vampire almost kills you because of a paper cut. 

Bella wants Edward back so much now, she jumps off cliffs randomly! She now meets Jacob, a really, *really*, nice guy, who comforts her throughout her ""agony"", and is overall a beta. He loves him, as a friend. Gotta love what happens next, because Jacob is now turning into a werewolf and leaves Bella to become a muscular, alpha (he is supposed to be an actual alpha in a wolf pack), high status (of course), werewolf! Bella suddenly becomes interested in him, I wonder why?

Edward somehow learns that Bella killed herself by jumping off a cliff, which is actually a funny series of miscommunications that culminates in Edward going to Italy to do a ""suicide by cop"" type thing. Edward comes back, Bella fawns all over him, all is happy again, with Bella using Jacob for lots of emotionally support and what not, and trying to get Edward to have sex with her in her spare time.

Edward starts to lose his alpha touch in book 3, when Bella constantly bugs him to go visit her ""friend"", Jacob. Tables are turned, Edward is the beta, and Jacob is the alpha. On one of her visits to Jacob, Jacob decides to tell her that he loves her. That is the shittiest piece of game I've ever seen in a book, and Bella cannot friend him fast enough.

Jacob now goes dark triad (he can't make up his mind), and decides to run around to get himself killed and is a complete psychopath. Bella falls in love with him, even though she just friend zoned him chapters before (holy shit hamster is going to break his wheel).

Unfortunately, Bella decides to choose Edward for her provider relationship, because at this point Edward is a complete beta (Bella did it), and Bella wants the beta bux.

Now, at this point, I'm at Breaking Dawn, the final book in the series. Just when you thought Edward couldn't spend more lavish amounts of money on things, he goes out onto a private island with Bella, (they got married because Edward is a fucking idiot). Lots of unprotected sex ensues, (seriously Edward, use a condom), and Bella doesn't get an STD, but gets pregnant with a vampire hybrid baby.

Unlike all of her vampire friends, Bella's hamster breaks the fucking sound barrier and she decides to keep the vampire hybrid baby. Keep in mind, her father-in-law (who was described as the greatest doctor in the world, non-sarcastically) has told her that the baby will pose a great risk to her and will probably kill her. Never trust a woman to get an abortion.

Through a banal series of events (three phone calls), Jacob is now going on a Rambo-esque quest to save Bella from becoming a vampire. He learns it was all a misunderstanding, because he actually sees her pregnant with a vampire hybrid baby who is now actively trying to kill her by breaking her bones from the inside. Jacob literally begs her to get an abortion. Hamster runs at hypersonic speeds, vaporizing the wheel as Bella tells him that she will ""probably live long enough"" to deliver the baby and then she will become a vampire.

Due to the fact that human-vampire hybrid babies are generally considered as dangerous freaks of nature who will probably kill random things, Jacob's wolf pack sets up an attack to kill the baby. At this point, Jacob starts his own wolf pack because he is sad about killing demonic vampire babies. At this point, Bella starts drinking blood (she is not a vampire yet) to feed the baby. But while she is drinking blood, she falls over, breaks her pelvis, almost every bone in her body, and her spine with help from the baby.

Edward makes her a vampire, and Jacob conveniently walks in to see (kill) the new baby. But when he sees her, the most bullshit, anti-male plot device I have ever seen in my life comes into play. It's called ""imprinting"", and I'm not kidding about this, as soon as Jacob saw the vampire baby, he is doomed to a life of beta orbiting around her.

Hamster goes into lightspeed in Bella's mind, as she tries to rationalize Jacob, her alpha person, raising a child from birth, just so he can fuck her when she's 18. Holy shit, that is disturbing. It actually turns out at this point that there's a secret hamster in every vampire mind, because years back, a bunch of vampires turned babies into vampires, and it was disturbing shit that is pretty much the holocaust for vampires. The only difference between those babies and this one is that this one is half human, half vampire. 

The vampire government comes over, scared out of their minds because Bella just hamstered away a creature outlawed for causing ""mental scars in every vampire"". At this point, the vampire hybrid baby thing turns out not to be a vampire baby, sorry if this is confusing, but Bella's baby wasn't dangerous at all, even though it pretty much killed her by breaking her spine. 

Everything ends incredibly happily, with Edward morphed into a sexless beta who Bella relies on for emotional support, Jacob is a pedophile who Bella obviously still wants, Bella doesn't do jack shit whatsoever, Edward does everything for her, and Bella's baby overwhelms any sense of happiness for anything or anybody else. 

This is truly a case study of what women want, and how they get their man, and to quote somebody on here, ""turn lions into pussycats"".

27dzrm,97,27dzrm,2014-06-05T23:28:24Z,comms_num,426,top,1,TheRedPill,993,"About once every month or two, there’s a post somewhere on Reddit, by a woman, saying something like, “My boyfriend suddenly started doing Red Pill stuff and now I want out,” followed by 4-6 paragraphs explaining how her boyfriend is now a controlling, abusive asshole who works out and wants sex (because these traits are, of course, very, very unique to The Red Pill, and any guy who exhibits them obviously went online, found us, and we ruined him). These threads get seized upon by our detractors, who eagerly point out: “See? See!? The Red Pill doesn’t ‘work’ ! It just ends relationships and turns guys into assholes!”

Independent of what is and is not actually “Red Pill behavior,” situations like these are based a bad assumption. Simply put, in examples like this, the lamenting woman has presupposed that prior to her man’s “changes”, their relationship was actually good, and he was actually happy. Then he ruined everything by reading some bullshit online that told him how his relationship ought to be, then trying to implement it.

This begs the question: If the relationship was fine before the boyfriend went all Red Pill on his woman, why is he trying to change things? Why did he go on the internet and seek out the manosphere? If he’s happy with his relationship the way it is, why is he trying to find ways to improve his sex life and become more assertive?  (All of this, of course, assumes that a) the stories presented on Reddit are true; and b) the man actually sought out The Red Pill and didn’t just stop kissing his girlfriend’s ass for any number of other reasons.)

The Red Pill is here because men aren’t happy. They don’t want to be sweet and sensitive and do things for women all day long and be the “perfect boyfriend,” while having subpar sex once every six weeks, paying out the ass for expensive dates and gifts, sacrificing personal time, and getting bitched at and threatened with a break-up if any of this perfect behavior ever dips slightly. They don’t want to give backrubs and footrubs, stay at home one weekend a month while their women have a night out with the girls, get disrespected and talked about behind their backs, get cheated on (but just harmless, meaningless mistakes that don’t really count!), and get berated when they push back against any of this. They don’t want to let women move in, rent-free, and get pressured to buy a ring for a four-digit number of dollars and tie their finances to someone who makes less than half as much money, just because they’ve been “dating awhile” and “it’s time” and they’re “supposed to.”

Sure, everything’s hunky-dory for these girlfriends, but for the men, everything is NOT happy. Everything is NOT going well. And men are sick of it.

When a 28-year-old man with an entitled bitch of a girlfriend of 5 years stumbles across the Red Pill, he reads stories about men not so much older than he is who don’t have or want girlfriends. They don’t need a girlfriend because they have four or five women fucking their brains out on a regular basis outside of a relationship. They barely spend a cent on dates or activities. They barely lift a finger to impress women. But girls can’t seem to get enough of them.

And what these men do seems so simple. Work out, focus on your career, practice your social skills and get confident, develop useful skills and interesting hobbies – essentially, quit wasting time. Read non-fiction instead of fiction, watch less TV, play less video games, quit jerking off to porn, spend that time doing something that makes you physically, mentally, or socially better. The Red Pill tells men that their time is valuable, and to use it well. Hand in hand with that, The Red Pill tells men that since their time is their most valuable resource, quit wasting it on women when you’re not getting something of equal value in return. If your girlfriend is ugly, sexually ungenerous, lazy, or just an entitled bitch that expects you to do all kinds of crap for her just to maintain the pleasure of having a girlfriend, is it really worth all of the time and energy you expend? When you could be doing something that actually improves your life?

The Red Pill exists because many men aren’t happy. Because these relationships that are allegedly “just fine” are very much NOT just fine. Because men are giving so much to their women and getting so little, with the assumption that merely existing – merely being a presence in the man’s life – is all a woman needs to do to become his highest priority. That men should be falling over themselves getting in line for the right to say “I have a girlfriend,” and nothing more. Men are sick of this.

Guys in the “my man went Red Pill and ruined our relationship” Reddit posts probably aren’t actually going to internet sites to get an instruction manual for how to piss off their girlfriends. They’re just normal guys who know in the pit of their stomach that something is wrong – that they’re wasting their lives, and that they’re not happy. It’s not their girlfriends’ fault, it’s theirs. And they decide one day, for whatever reason, to try to take control of their lives, of their relationships, and build something they’re actually proud of. And steps 1 and 2 of that process involve asserting yourself and living the way you want, and expecting the people with whom you associate (e.g., your woman) to add value to your life equal to the value you’re expending. The rest of the world shorthands that behavior as “being an asshole,” and “ruining relationships.” How sad is that? Honestly and confidently pursuing the life you want, and expecting others to hold up their end of a relationship is the new Hitler.",993,4,0.3465999960899353,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first",1

A week later, I took her out again. It was the day after her birthday, to which she spent it alone. She has hardly any friends, and went on a monologue about how she doesnt spend time with her family.

She then over drinks tells me how she had a friend who was an escort and tried to get her involved in that. She was also jokingly asking questions about girls I'd been with previously. Was very funny but strange, why did she care.

I go back to drop her home, she admits she has feelings for me, we kiss and fondle in my car and she goes on about how she is going to survive this weekend with no money. She asked me for some change to buy a sandwich tomorrow. The girl is in a Classy dress and has zero money to buy food.

The next day (I didnt sleep with her) she left her charger in my car, which I drove to her place to drop it back. A very different girl greeted me. No makeup, nothing. Gives me a little kiss outside her bedsit which apparently is paid for by her Grandma. Insists I cannot go up and says she has cash for weekend, even though I didnt even ask.

We kiss I say goodbye, to the next day on social media tweeting how shes after a ""prince charming"" and she will ""Meet him one day"" and how she has a ""chastity belt"" etc etc. 

She unfollowed me then re followed me despite me messaging her. It hit me. Ashamed of her home. Ashamed to be seen kissing infront of her house. Classy dress sense. No family ties at all. No friends.

On an unrelated note, I've been spending more and more time with my lover, so yesterday my wife *confronted* me as asked me if I was having an affair. I didn't admit or deny to it right away but I started a conversation about the state of our relationship, this time was a different type of conversation, I was focused on:

* maintaining *Frame*

* being *Alpha*

* *DGAF*

* *outcome independent*

It was interesting how I remained calm and emotionless throughout and I was able to:

* call my wife's bullshit, when it was bullshit

* control her emotional outbursts, just by calling them

* call out her *rationalization hamster*, just by calling it

* keep the conversation on topic by not allowing her to deviate from where the conversation was going if it was no longer convenient to her

At one point I told her that I am having an affair, that I *care* about my lover but don't *love* her; and that I *love* her (my wife).  I told her that I don't intend to end my affair and that she (my wife) is free to leave any time she wants.

I didn't give in into any details about my affair, she doesn't know who my lover is, how long it has been, my line was always *It will only make you feel bad*.

Then last night wife and I fucked like we've never fucked before, and this morning too she wanted to do it again, a rare occurrence in our sex life, then she texted me that she loves me and she's looking forward to fuck again tonight.

For those of you wondering: 

* no, wife won't be having an affair. 

* Will she leave me? Maybe. I don't care, I've told her that I want a divorce but she won't agree (long story). 

* If she gives me the ultimatum *""me or her""* I will just remind her that I've asked her for a divorce long time and multiple times, she just need to agree to it and we both walk away.  

* In case of divorce my lover would just be *a plate*, as of now I think of my wife and my lover as 2 plates.

My asking my wife to consent to the divorce is a favor to her, to protect her financially and to ease her into a post marriage life; she won't do it because she loves me and adores me, and she's hoping to work things out, but after 15+ years or trying to work things out I have given up, I have swallowed the Red Pill and I have realized that having affairs is not a way to cope with a bad marriage, even one where I ~~love~~ *loved* my wife.",923,4,0.38109999895095825,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first",1

If anything could ever be classified as a Feminist's Nightmare, it's the irreconcilable notion that women are extremely aroused at the thought of being able to make a high value man so lustful that he loses control and has to have her.  Many women have struggled with this concept.  Some have cleverly come up with positive terminology to deflect from the dissonance; they'll use terms like ""ravishment"" to doll it up, as if simply assigning a new word takes away from the reality of what's going on.

Here in TRP we do not shy from these realities.  What goes through a woman's head when she contemplates being ravished is that she is of such high SMV that men lose their control just to have her.  This is a level of validation few women get to truly experience.  The male equivalent would be a pair of beautiful women demanding that you have a threesome with them.  

I've no doubt this type of post causes SJW's to froth at the mouth, but their impotent rage doesn't invalidate reality.  Consider the success of 50 Shades of Grey.  The basic synopsis is that a powerful, rich, alpha man completely lusts and forcefully dominates a perfectly boring average woman.  You'd think this banal concept would only sell to a fringe that gets off on this kink, but the book sold **70 million copies** in 8 months.  That's more than any Harry Potter novel.  And now that the movie is out I guarantee it will be a box-office hit.  Let women scream and ""Wow, just wow"" at you all they want -- their words mean nothing in relation to their actions.  Women want to be taken by force by a high value man.

So when is it rape instead of ravishment?  Aside from obvious cases of drugging someone or having sex with the unconscious (for the feminazi retards: **No one here condones these instances of legitimate rape**)  the difference is strictly in the disparity of your SMV's.  The stranger-in-the-bush is often characterized as some seedy low-life thug.  This evokes intense fear.  Being forcefully held down in bed by the muscular CEO of a Fortune 500 company does not evoke this fear.  No woman alive is comfortable by the idea that she enjoys rape, so she needs to reframe it.  Be aware of that.

So how does the average TRP'er benefit from this?  If you're already sexually active with a woman, discuss the concept of a safeword.  Even though women love the idea of being taken, there's always the chance that she may be in one of those emotional frames where she genuinely isn't up for sex, this is a failsafe.  Once you've established that, next time you're looking to sexually escalate simply ignore her token attempts to refuse.  She turns her lips away from a kiss, you force her against a wall and take it.  She tries to push you off, you squeeze her.  You grab her and throw her onto the bed, then lay into her with your weight so she can't get away.  And so on.

Paradoxically this creates intense arousal and pair-bonding in women.  I encourage you to try this.  Of all the women I've had sex with only ~5% genuinely hated rough, aggressive sex.  The other 95% beg for more afterwards.

This isn't what The Red Pill that I once knew is truly about. 

What disappoints me is that the idea of ""going your own way"" isn't exactly going your own way, regardless of how you try to rationalize it. It's a form of submission. Someone who has decided to ""go their own way"" has likely experienced some severe difficulties with women to get to that point. We've all been there at different stages in life. 

But here's the thing: By choosing to ""go your own way,"" **you aren't actually going your own way.** You're letting your difficulties and hardships with women overcome your true desires. 

You're essentially saying ""Women are stupid and I'm done with them. I don't need them to live a happy and successful life. I can just masturbate and work hard forever and I'll be fine."" 

Bullshit. 

What if I told you that TRULY going your own way is going after *everything* that you want out of life? That's the TRP that I once knew. Building your mind, body and skills to where you can go after everything that you want. You can become wildly successful. You can maintain your health and well-being. And you can get some goddamn pussy on the side, too. 

Taking the redpill IS going your own way in life, because it's about achieving everything that you want. This lifestyle is for the rare men who want it all. And which heterosexual men don't want to have sex with beautiful women? 

If you classify yourself as a ""MGTOW"" then you've probably already given up - either temporarily or for the long-term. But, my advice is to come back to the dark side. Nothing in life can replace achieving all of your goals **and** having sex with attractive women.

Work is slow every day? I wonder what this woman does for a living? Probably HR or some other liberal arts degree related job.

Oh, the joys of social media. Apparently because all her friends are doing it, she decided she had to do it too! Apparently her boyfriend should be judged against her friends' boyfriends / husbands! Could you imagine how that would go over if it was the other way around. I can imagine some Jizzabel cat lady now:

She says that to make him sound cheap, but if the dude can cook, has money, and knows how to save it instead of throwing it away and living in a perpetual cycle of credit card debt like so many Americans.

In yet another post lamenting the nature of (western) women, this was the main point that was upvoted:

How is this sexual strategy again? How is this relevant to getting laid and cultivating plates?

In short, why does ""Bro Code"" have to be the fallback plan in every post where a guy is having trouble with women? Why is withdrawing from women even considered? What happened to actually *learning* how to deal with them?

Examples of actual sexual strategy:

- Flakes: double and triple book my dates for redundancy. 

- Drunk girls: Don't target girls at bars who are plastered. Or, work out logistics so dates are near your place and within walking distance so you don't have to negotiate them into a cab.

- Western women: Target selection. Take control of where you live (I live in Asia (personal choice I made) that has certainly solved this problem). Or choose better what targets you talk to. Or move to a bigger city like LA or Vancouver. Or [make your frame solid that women's shit tests don't matter](https://archive.today/P3bLx).

- Lack of loyalty (cheating) in women vs men: This is the nature of women and can be understood and exploited. Women are not men and loyalty to *one* man has never benefited them. What they *are* 100% loyal to is high SMV (could be one man or many). Once you understand that, you can achieve high SMV so you don't have to deal with this.

Not sexual strategy:

- ""Ugh I got burned by a bitch again. So fucking done. Going into monk mode, fellas!""

- ""Always value your bros because they won't betray you!""

So...are you going to turn gay? Are you going to fuck your guy friends when you're horny? 

Yeah I didn't think so...so, why is that even offered as a solution? What happened to solutions that actually accomplish the original goal? (aka effective ways of getting laid and dealing with the *true* nature of women, the understanding of which has been largely lost in today's generation of men).

Again, this sub is about **Sexual Strategy**, which requires you are actually in the game. 

It's NOT a male support group where we recover from the big, bad, meanie women and act all horrified how they don't share male views of sex/relationships/commitment/honesty and the favorite ""bro code"" word of the day: Honor.

Newsflash: If you are dumb enough to put trust into a woman and then get surprised/butthurt when she doesn't reciprocate, then you don't know women. If put in 10/10 effort and are entitled enough to think women should/will put in 10/10 effort back, you don't know women.

Women respond according to what will garner them the man with highest resources, and the ""morality"" of that response is irrelevant. Women will rationalize/justify/hamster their behavior after the fact; In her mind, cheating on you or dumping your ass for a buffer guy was 100% justified and not wrong. Complain about it all you want, but she made the right choice FOR HER, for her survival, for her instincts. 

---

On the other hand, if you actually GET sex regularly, you will understand that lumps/drunk girls/random flakes/etc go with the territory. Yet, these difficulties now precipitate ""monk mode with my bros"" instead of actually solving the issue.

Seriously, you know how many drunk girls have thrown up in my bathroom/kitchen? How many times a girl has ghosted on me? How many times I've fucked a girl I thought was totally into only me and then her phone rings while she's sleeping and it shows up as ""❤❤❤ My Bobby ❤❤❤""? 

These ""speed bumps"" shouldn't be surprises, nor should they justify opting out of the game. It will not solve your issue.

Further, the implication that monk moders have a monopoly on male friendship, working out, or saving money is ridiculous. There is no connection. Getting laid gets me lots of male friends who give me props and want to party with me; it gives me the motivation to work out harder; it saves me $ because I spin plates who come directly to my home instead of buying them dinner/drinks.

TLDR: Get better at getting laid; Don't give up on it altogether. If the goal is to get laid and you fail at that, suddenly redefining the goal as not getting laid anymore is a total cop-out.",888,4,0.3709999918937683,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first",1

If we look at the statistics, single mothers are worse parents than single fathers. Women practice more favoritism with their children, spank more often and at younger ages, make poorer economic decisions and a whole host of other issues. I've heard that women are supposed to be the more caring of the two sexes, but the single most important factor for predicting the development of empathy in a child is a FATHER in the home, not a mother. 


Women are more likely to divorce for money, sleep around more often, feel less remorse, and prop up a bunch of the dumb feminist movements. After women were given the right to vote, the government tilted heavily to social programs and left leaning doctrines, almost single handedly creating the dependency/handout system and putting the country in debt.

For the definition of God, if you don't believe in any particular God, then use the definition of ""existence itself"" which is something you obviously can't deny--that existence exists, and that it precedes and is the necessary condition for all other things.  It is the essence of being, and makes a good philosophical placeholder for anyone who doesn't believe in any other understanding of God.

How much do we rely on God?  Or, again for atheists, how much do we rely on existence existing?   Completely and 100%.  We have nothing, we are nothing without God/existence.

This is reflected in the way a child thinks about its parents.  And especially its mother in its earliest years.  If they are out of the room, it is an existential crisis.  We can understand that.

And yet, we often have difficulty with the notion that woman's being is fundamentally as dependent on man, as a child's is on its mother, and a man's is on God/existence. (Naturally, woman and children need God/existence, too… it's a flow-chart.)

But I find this analogy can help explain the way women shit-test and say  things irrational and horrible to men.

Have you ever cursed God?  Cursed the day you were born?  Cursed the evil in the world, for which you place the blame on God, when the real culprit was Man?  Blamed God for all your shortcomings, like a whiny feminist blaming men for all of hers?

Said, or thought to God, if you do x, I'll believe in you.  If you don't, I won't.  You are more powerful, but it's only by the standards of MY tests that you should prove yourself.

Have you ever thought that existence is inherently evil or absurd?  And railed against the absurd universe, spouted off to your friends with existential angst… yet another day, you beamed in some euphoria, understanding that all existence is pure and good and you are part of it?

Are you not like a woman who hates men, and loves men.  Says she doesn't need them, and cries for days when they ignore her?

And isn't she coming to you like a child crying for Mommy?

(And did not God perhaps, for love of woman and man, come into existence as a child, through woman, to become a man, sacrificing all to  be glorified as God, making a full cycle?!)

Anyway, this is just a thought that helps me understand women better.  I wanted it to be accessible to believers and non-believers alike, because I think it's true and makes sense in the order of existence.

How many children want to be taken for big boys and big girls?  To be treated as adults?  Yet it is ridiculous when they try.  They can never do so until they grow into that.

And how many men want to be seen as Gods?  Yet their efforts are ridiculous!  A big apartment and a swimming pool.  An expensive car.  Leading a company.  Can that compare to the creation of the universe?!  We know these men are fools.

And yet how many women want to be taken for men?  Strong, rational, reading a Sheryl Sandberg book, aspiring to be a CEO, because that's what a man does.  They have no idea what a man does and they are just as ridiculous for trying as a child putting Mommy's sports bra on their head so they can dress up as Mommy.

And when a woman wails and cries against YOU… not against children, nor against God, but YOU… it is because she feels as you do when you rail against the cruel indifference of the universe, or the unanswered prayer.

While you do whatever it takes to conquer the world, no holds barred, take no prisoners because the competition is tough… that is just how she will take it to YOU, to find her meaning by conquering you.

But to be conquered by her is like her being conquered by a child.  It would show she was weak and backwards.

Thinking of this ordering, putting man and woman in the context with children and God(/bare existence) helps me see myself and my flaws in what women do, without seeing our flaws as equal.

I have a shelf dedicated to third wave feminism. I especially like third-wave feminism and intersectionalism. Butler, Sedgwick, and Foucault are prominent.

Oh, and of course I work to make sure our office has annual guest speakers on racial inequality, LGBT rights in the workplace, and how to address the paygap between men and women practically in the workplace. 


Why? 


Think as you like but behave like others.  


Some of you are holding onto romantic notions that you can effect change. That the wheels haven't fully come off the cart. That we're not in some state of decline. No, no, and no. When you watch documentaries on climate change and the ppm of CO2 in the atmosphere you'll hear some of the smartest minds in science say that we're already past a tipping point, that when the warming affects are manifest decades from now, even if we stopped all CO2 emissions today, that Earth is going to become warm enough that enough species will perish that the few extant species won't be sustainable. That either we'll be living in some ecological hell with quality of life that wanes to today's standard, or that we'll succumb to the extinction event ourselves. You may believe that, or you may not. I don't know that I care. The analogy can be made to feminism; we're past the tipping point. Even if all the virulent tumblr-esque rhetoric were to cease, all the gender studies programs to suddenly be exposed for the farces they are, it'd be too late. We're already formative years into this next generation deeply indoctrinated by our feminized culture afraid of and persecuting boys for existing as some necessary evil. These children will become adults, and their formative years have already been spent in public schools with single mothers. A decade from now it'll still be more toxic than it is now, no matter what you do in the interim. 


And even if you don't believe that, it doesn't matter. TRP is about accepting what is. Men's Rights, or any other advocacy organization, is about creating change. We're not changing anything but ourselves. We're accepting the world for what it is and acting accordingly. Your job isn't reversing the denigration of society, it's carving out your own little Eden insulated from the social justice equivalent of ecological demise. 


So make yourself immune from criticism from social justice or complaint from the left more generally. Purporting to believe as others do, and espousing their views even more aggressively than they do, is the key to my workplace success. If anyone hears something they don't like, I attack them from the left. Don't like that my division is making inroads on your clients? It's probably because we have a culture of diversity, I can't believe how many members of your management team are white women; why aren't you hiring more diverse candidates? Think that I'm being overly aggressive? It's probably because I'm so passionate about demolishing existing power structures and creating an office-wide meritocracy where we credit our success to inclusion and pay it back by organizing division-wide volunteering events at women's organizations. 


Oh, and talk like them, and use their words. 


Three women six months ago were upset with me. They called one of my programs idiotic. I emailed them a link on problematic ableist language and gave a heads up to HR. HR loves me.

I am seen as some sort of ""enemy"" for telling kids - KIDS - to hit the books and not put so much emphasis on getting pussy. These are not men in their 20's and 30's - these are socially awkward younger guys in high school or younger that find their way in here looking for advice. Call me a fucking loser, but that advice isn't the same as advice I'd give a legally responsible adult - but I'm an asshole for it. Well, so be it. I stand by my advice and you guys can suck a dick, because If you had sons, I'd HOPE your advice to them when they're in school isn't ""Screw your education! Get as much pussy as possible!"".** /end rant.

I've been seeing a lot of posts here from younger guys asking how to ""get the girl"" or ""be more alpha"", because they don't have success with girls, and see other ""more successful"" guys getting steady GFs or having sex at parties. 

In order to help you, you need to understand some things, so I'm going to lay them out for you. 

 * You're a teenager. Your body is flooded with hormones. You get uncomfortable random boners. You can't study because the girl next to you has her thong riding up on her hip. You feel forever alone and you know that having a girlfriend (or even just getting laid) will make your life 100% better. Why? Because your biology is overriding your brain and putting pussy on the pedestal for you. Being a man means reigning in those urges and taking control of your feelings and not becoming a slave to them. All men go through being sex-craving teenagers - it's a normal state of growth, but don't let it define you or set your priorities.

 * Girls are NOT a big mystery. They have even **more** insecurities than you do. They bleed out their vaginas for up to a week per month. They get shit for being too fat, not following the herd and they have low self-esteem and body issues. However bad you think **your** situation is, be lucky you're a guy. Girls your age are fickle, bitchy, shallow and superficial. Unless you're one of those guys who already gets female attention, don't waste your time chasing them - girls your age are a bad / risky investment. Instead, focus that energy on your studies. Women will always be there - what's the rush? The last thing you want is some chick's drama twisting you up or becoming a babydaddy at your age. 


 * You live in an artificial bubble. Your life **now** is not representative of what life is like after school - not even close - it's like life with training wheels on. Right now you if you fail a class people will offer you guidance, assistance and resources that you can use to dig yourself out of a hole. You're protected. Out in the world, you're thrown to the wolves and have to get by on your own wits and merits - nobody cares if you succeed or fail. The things you **think** are important now (going to prom, getting invited to parties, making out with chicks) are going to be trivial and in a few years you're going to look back and laugh on the huge importance you placed on those things. Your situation is temporary. You will change. Life will change you. 

 * You feel powerless because you are subjected to the rules others impose on you (parents, teachers etc.). This doesn't change much when you're an adult. You're still subject to the law and your boss. You will still need to follow some rules. But you will also be able to make some rules for yourself, and you can start now. You might be a fat kid who isn't in control of your family's diet, but you can control how much you eat and you can ask for a weight set or lift weights at school or join a sport. You might be a shy kid with no friends, but you can join a speech or debate club and hone those skills. You might be awkward around girls, but you can join the drama club, where you get to interact with them directly. There are things you can do to improve yourself right now - take advantage of the resources available to you. Playing video games for five hours a night will do absolutely nothing for your future. 

 * Things will get better. Girls start at the top of the hill and coast down until they run out of steam. Men stand at the bottom of the mountain and see how far they can climb. Your value will appreciate as you gain wealth, status and self-improve. Your appearance will change. Your acne will go away. A woman's prime attractiveness is her looks, her youth and her fertility. Your prime attractiveness are your looks, resources and status, and if you lack in one you can still have success if you excel in the others. This is why you need to study your ass off, get good grades and invest in your future - because in fifteen years the good looking jock who peaked in high school will be stuck selling used cars while the bookworm who had career goals is pulling six figures. Women are a by-product of success - if you're successful **they** will be drawn to **you**, and you haven't even come **CLOSE** to hitting your prime. Work on securing your financial future. Do that by hitting the books and making good grades. 

Re-prioritize your shit - try not to think with your dick. Girls your age are attracted to hotter, older guys or guys who other girls think are hawt (herd mentality). High school is nothing like real life, so what happens to you now socially is inconsequential. You have a lot of control over how you end up, and forming good habits now will help you tremendously later. You are so far from being at peak value, both time-wise and who you are as a person, that it's not even worth worrying about. Work on your grades and set your goals now.

Here is the full story as a reminder: http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/04/n-y-prenup-battle-winner-destroyed-family-with-affair-cousin-says/

This woman meets a successful millionaire who's built his own fortune through his life's own hard work and investments in real estate.

She wants to marry, being a smart guy he naturally is wary that she could be after his money.  She doesn't want to sign a prenup, but he says there is no way they are getting married with out one, so she reluctantly agrees.

Well, come several kids later, she hits the wall and wants a divorce.  She claims the prenup is the reason for their marriage falling apart, even though she never was forced into it. She could have always refused the marriage and refused the prenup.  But those were his conditions and she accepted it.

Well it turns out she was full of shit.  She was cheating on her husband with her cousin's husband.  When her cousin comes out against her with this, she has no option but to admit to it.  But she still insists her affair wasn't the reason for the marriage falling apart, oh no, she still insists it was the pre-nup.

Here's the real kicker:

She tells the judge that her husband had promised her he would get rid of the prenup after they had children.  That's what she says, that he made an oral agreement with her.  She has no proof of this promise or this oral agreement, its just his word against hers.

Well the judge believes her, and throws out the prenup, and now she is entitled to half his money, even after she cheated on him, even after he thought he was safe by signing a prenup.

Remember guys, not even a prenuptial agreement can protect you.  Marriage can and will destroy you, there is absolutely no point.

Be careful in even entering a de facto marriage before you live.  In some countries, being in a LTR with someone where you move in together and live together for some time as de factos can still grant the ex-partner your assets should you break up.

I think it's partly this guy's fault for being a doormat. A list of all the things he did for her:

>He would always offer a helping hand, or would listen. We'd have conversations on skype, and he'd always be supportive and offer friendly advice. At work, he was really flexible with his shifts and would always rearrange to cover mine. For example, if I couldn't make a shift on a certain day, and would prefer another day, he would always gladly swap with me. He was always friendly about it. When I was moving apartments a couple months ago, he helped me move my stuff. When I didn't have my car for about two weeks, he drove me to work and home every day. He was an incredibly good friend and I was really thankful to have someone like him around.

>And he was also incredibly emotionally supportive, whenever I'd talk about my issues with friends or family, he'd listen. I've had depression and anxiety in the past, I take meds for it, and it comes back every now and again. I have a lot of personal worries, fears and issues, and he's always ready to listen and be supportive.

He asks her out and of course she says no. Surprisingly he doesn't just become an orbiter and keep doing nice things for her, instead he moves on which annoys her:

>Then over the next few days I noticed things were a bit different. He would still talk to me, chit chat occasionally, smile, say Hi. But he wasn't as receptive to conversations with me any more. On skype when we'd talk, he'd take longer to respond, and seems always uninterested and giving one word responses.
With work, he's no longer swapping any shifts with me. He says he can't manage the time, and he's also on a busy work and life schedule that he can't always move things around. 

>I'm moving apartments again in a months time, and I asked if he'd be ready to help me move again like last time, he said probably not and that he's too busy.

He's not giving her undivided attention and doing her favors all the time so what's her reaction?

>Now suddenly, its almost like he's an asshole.

>Did I make friends with a ""nice guy""? Was he really just an asshole all along only pretending to be nice to get in my pants?

Lesson: So if a guy doesn't give you undivided attention and time, he's an asshole.

>Yeah, you knew him for 8 months OP. He was never really your ""friend"" as he viewed you as a potential love interest. You shut him now, now he's protecting himself by creating distance and finding other girls to prioritize for dating.

>You are not entitled to preferential treatment. You are not dating him. You are not sleeping with him. He's just a dude and now he has other priorities. You don't get the benefit of boyfriend-like behavior from someone you will only accept platonic friendship with.

Things have been great, she does stuff for me without asking, sex all the time, everything you can ask for in a girl despite me being a bit of a pussy. 

However there were two problems. She was sometimes very bitchy with me, and one out of three times we had sex she didn't seem very into it. Not that she was repulsed, but she would talk about other shit while I was inside of her. This pissed me off more than the bitchiness.

Fast forward to a few months after discovering the RP, and all that has changed. I lift and box 5x a week. I try and lead whenever I can. I hold frame whenever I can. I apologize less. I called her out on her bitchiness and after a 2 day fight where I held frame (with the mindset of, if we break up she wasn't right for me anyway) the bitchiness has stopped. 

I put myself first while still being fair to her, and especially after the fight it is clear that if I am unhappy with her or the relationship I will leave her, even if it hurts. 

The sex nowadays? Off the fucking charts. From all the other shit ive been doing shes already more into it, but the last time she tried to talk about other shit (not being focused on the moment) I put my hand over her mouth and plowed her. I've never heard her moan like that in my life. When I took my hand off she told me to ""do that again.""

For two years I've been trying out some variation of the ""girls are dumb"" neg. I've recently had some success with a modified version of this.

Last year I tried this out on a plate, massage therapist plate, when I just up and told her she was dumb. This was not the most successful use of the ""girls are dumb"" neg but it lead me to yesterday's successful deployment.  So here's this story.

Last year my massage therapist plate and I were hanging out and drinking and she was trying to use me as her fucking beta cry pillow boy over some other alpha who pumped and dumped her. She's all sad, so I ask her what's up?  She tells me some vague story about some ""guy"", who was not one of her regular stable of beta orbiters, who she waited for outside of his work for three hours.  And he stood her up.

She dropped a tell by telling me that he's ""troubled"" and his ex is a ""real bitch"", to let me know that she wants his dick. And that she was all dressed up uncomfortable and waited in the hot sun, in her car, for three hours for this guy.  He went out with a different girl and he didn't even text her.  She's all mad and sad, telling me how upset she is because she texted him five times.

At this point this fucking plate was seriously testing my frame. Massive shit test telling me about her other alpha fucks.  I did not agree to spend time with this plate so that she could sob about getting pumped and dumped to me. That's her betas job.  And this bitch came over in pajamas wanting to fucking watch Pretty Little Liars with me. And she brought snacks.

So I just went nuclear on her. I told her that girls are often much dumber then they think. Because guys will always tell them how smart they are to get into their panties. And I reminded her that she failed the state massage therapist exam four times and I've got a degree from a fancy liberal brainwashing center.  And I straight told her that she's dumb and she needs to listen to me do what I tell her to do.  I told her she was going to end up being one of those sluts that gets an abortion.

I was using amused mastery and established high levels of pre selection and abusing the ""you're like my little sister"" game to go nuclear and straight tell her that she's stupid and needs to be led by a man like me.

Then I derailed that into her talking about how she's on birth control and I made sure she knew I had condoms.  When I fucked her she was quite submissive. But that was the night she told me ""I love you"" after sex.  And guys one thing I've learned is that once they drop the L-bomb on you their spinning orbit is going to expand until they spin into another man's pull.  Spin away plate.

Yesterday I went out with a potential mini-LTR.  Maybe even more.  I'm sick of soft harems so I'm looking for a girl I can spend maybe five years with. Maybe even more. Girl is 19 and prime and (likely) has not gone carouselling yet.  She still lives with her dad and hasn't started her college ride.  Been nineteen for two months.  We were texting.

I've been dropping pre selection into our conversations by occasionally mentioning my ""ex girlfriends"".  Any plate can become an ""ex"" in any conversation where it's useful to you. Especially if there are old pictures of you two together out on Facebook or something.

And I've already let this potential know that my last ex had bigger tits and a better ass then Starbuck's did.

She gets this;

""Well the last girl I was dating, *massage therapist*, was kind of stupid. I mean that's not some kind of moral judgement on my part. It's just that it was true. She had lots of other good things about her. She was very nice. And fun to hang out with. And she was a massage therapist and gave me free massages. Which are awesome by the way.  Plus her hair was long and she was cute.""

'Why did you think she was dumb?  Oy my dad always told me that guys will tell me anything to get into my pants.  (My pet parrot) just scared my dad. He's such a chicken!  :) :)'

""I mean she was just kind of dumb. One day I told her that she needed to stop making decisions without talking to me.  I forget how I worded it but I don't think I was mean. Maybe I was. I just let her know that she's not really very smart, but that's ok, and I liked her anyway.  And that there are lots of other good things about her.""

And I sent a second text before she could respond.

""I figured it would be good for her to know that she's not very smart because she always thought she was just so smart. And because of this she kept making bad decisions. Especially with money.

But her mom was always bailing her out.  And she was always going to her mom and having her mom buy us stuff. Even concert tickets once.""

And again I texted her before she could respond.

""She got so mad. I thought it was kind of funny but she was actually mad!  And she told me about all these other people, guys clearly, who had told her all about how smart (and funny) she was and is. I had to tell her that guys will lie to you if you are a girl and tell you all kinds of lies. To get into your panties.""

I don't typically send multiple messages so this broke our normal pattern of texts. She responded like so;

""Hey sometimes being dumb but really pretty gets you places lol. I personally hate that way. I am quite the opposite. I mean not because I'm not thin just I have bad genetics. With my large nose, big green eyes, and medium length black hair, with freckles.  Did you know I'm naturally a red head?  REAL red.  I'm a ginger. That's horrible! Some girls are real sluts, and some guys want nothing but a girls pants, which gets me really really angry.""

Conversation went fine with Starbucks.  And today I get this.  Have not texted her since last night and I now leave it to her to engage the chase, much to her delight.  She sends this;

""My favorite book is Fahrenheit 451.  I got an A on my AP English exam that I wrote on that very book.  My old English teacher Mrs. Snow even asked what I thought about that book.  So I really analyzed it. What's your favorite book *kill_your_ego*?""

So now she knows that she's got smaller tits then my pre-selection can pull, that I'll call a girl dumb to her face even with them tits.  Pics of us together on Facebook with massage therapist's tits out is +50 pre-selection bonus. And I'm sure this girl has looked.  And now she wants to qualify herself to me as not a dumb slut.

This girl is hard Christian so at some point in the future I'm going to bring up this old thread I've found (saved) on a Christian forum about what constitutes sex.  The consensus is that her sucking my dick isn't sex.  And it's iffy for her to let me go up her butt. But we can argue about it and hey why not try it out?

Gonna introduce that with more pre-selection.  I've established my n-number as 5 with Starbucks. By using hamster math and only counting my LTRs.  I think my 20+ number would make her think I'm a player or one of those evil PUAs or something.

But I can feed her hamster with *is this guy a player?*, and, *can my pussy lock him down?*, by so sincerely and honestly trying to figure out if my actual n-number is 5.  Cause it doesn't count when a girl sucks my dick right Starbucks?

What do you think girl?  Is it sex if she swallows my cum?

I see a lot of criticism recently on men who put women in their place. The typical criticism is that you are wasting your time and your breath and that it is not ""alpha"" to do so. And that it is no way to get laid. Bingo, thats the problem with that mentality right there, trying to get laid...

An Alpha male doesn't really try to get laid. I know, CRAZY huh. You're reading this and going oh bullshit so not true. Well it is I know from personal experience. Let them come to you. The fact that you compromise your beliefs and ideals just to get laid is repulsive. You are not RP. There is a quote my father told me since I was very young and have never forgotten, ""All it takes for evil to prevail in this world, is for good men to do nothing.""
And those with the mentality that it is a waste of time are guilty of just that. Natural selection is not going to weed these types of women out of the pickings. There is far too much media and men to support and reinforce their behavior. And it has gotten out of control, obviously. Thats why we are discussing it on this sub today. 

Shaming a slut or whore or feminist is exactly what you should be doing, Through intelligence. Not simply returning verbal blows, but actually de-assembling her ego and persona. Women might seem stupid but they are not. What you say to them if done correctly will ring in their psyche for the rest of their life. And that is where the change begins. When a man is being a pussy and letting his GF walk all over him, if all of his friends let him know he is being this way, chances are he will change and heed their advice. Similarly if men let women know the same when they are in the wrong. If enough take this approach, then we will start to see change.

You are not ""alpha"" because you are willing to dodge one or two shit tests and fuck some girl in a bar after a few cocktails. Sorry... If that is what you base your dominance and manlyhood on you are a pussy. Plain and simple. You are a boy. A boy with no control over his sexuality that simply needs to just get it in so bad! Ohhh god I can't wait to just fuck her and then I am so ""alpha"" now and so ""dominant"" because I fucked an inebriated bar slut even though she annoys the shit out of me. And in the morning I will solidify my ""alpha dominance"" by starting to play my video games and tell her to leave! Yeah... mmk. 

Being a man is having control over your sexuality and its needs. Channeling it. Because that testosteronal sex drive is some of the best fuel you can ever use to fund your life. Following your passions, obtaining success in the field of those passions, being content, fit, healthy, and strong. Helping the sick and being a leader amongst so many losers and failures. Being kind and courteous, until trampled on. Always being ready to destroy the enemy yet never wanting to have to do so. Complete control. That is dominance. That is Alpha. Handle your shit. 

Setting aside your beliefs and ideals just to get laid, your no better than the muck slut bar flys you hit on and succumb to. Re-think your shit. Stop masturbating to images on a computer screen and jazzing into a kleenex 3 times a day since you were 13, and go make something of your life. Build some fucking character. Move out... save money while moved out... If you are living at home past the age of 20 you're a fucking child. And don't tell me you're saving money, shut the fuck up. Seriously.

Many of us have pointed out that feminists will avoid and even censor any discussion of rape when it is not committed by white men. The famous example is in Rotherham UK where 1400 children were raped by Muslim gangs, and groomed in prostitution as young as 8 years of age. The right wing were not able to stop it for over a decade as they were labelled racist and islamophobic by the left and feminists. The police and a liberal local government actively covered it up and allowed it; in many cases they said the children were asking for it, essentially. An example of a feminist trying to cover up what had happened, even after the story had become official: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7JmVwMNq4c

On New Years eve 1000 refugees were releasing fireworks and brawling. Gangs of refugees cornered women in subways. Only 10 police were assigned by police to manage the situation. There was one rape and 80 or so sexual assaults. http://www.breitbart.com/london/2016/01/04/revealed-1000-migrants-brawl-rape-sexually-assault-steal-one-german-train-station-new-years-eve/ . Also: 
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-35231046 . The story is everywhere now, including Reuters and NYT so check your favourite source.

However the default subreddits are not letting this hate speech be told. worldnews has banned it as local news, although it is front page news all across Europe many right wing papers, the number 2 story on BBC, and reported widely in America now. A moderator did however give somebody the real reason: https://i.imgur.com/21U1AIU.png .

Worst of all is that the 2XChromosomes subreddit has deleted all threads talking about the mass sexual assaults and rape in Cologne on that evening. The default sub for females is actively covering up mass sexual assault! 

The silence is deafening. Leftist/Feminists enable rape by attempting to cover up assaults. They choose to virtue signal or fight for agendas that make themselves feel good, even when it results in more rapes for other women. It is the ultimate act of selfishness and hypocrisy.

**Body:** I have to get this off my chest, since I am freshly unplugged and have used RP theories in my sexual strategy to my advantage. I cherish and value the input and advice of the community on this matter, however, many posts about the immigration crisis lead to wrong conclusions. Just a disclaimer before beginning: I am a German citizen and therefore not an English native speaker. I excuse for any misplaced figures of speech and/or wrong orthography/grammar.

Over the last few months, a number of posts concerning the European Immigration Crisis have acquired a high number of upvotes.
 
The major points are about censorship and suppressing ""hateful comments"" in the media and reddit. No discussion about that. Even worse is the climate this creates, people **afraid of voicing their opinion** and thus self-censoring themselves. However, let's take a look at some opinions voiced in the comments about immigration.

> It's interesting to note it was Feminist organizations and primarily-female protesters leading the push for the female chancellor Angela Merkel to let in what is essentially an aggressive barbarian horde. 
*ThereAndBlackAgain*

> The really ironic thing is if those Muslim ""refugee"" types that they rush to defend end up acquiring too much power, they will have no problem putting the femicunts in their place. You think you are oh so oppressed now, how about some Sharia Law and a REAL patriarchy? 
*Polaris382*


> In the past, they let immigrants trickle in, so even the more hostile ones would have time to settle down and feel like a significant cultural minority. This created a lot of pressures for them to integrate into German culture.
Now, fast forward to today, and that's all changed. The mass influx of these immigrants allowed them to create ingroups where they don't need to deviate nor change from their current cultural hang ups. They aren't integrating, nor are they inviting. Today, I actually feel worried at times walking down the street. I have friends tell me about being robbed, I've seen people get punched, and stores actually broken into and robbed. It's crazy -- I'm sure it occasionally has happened in the past, but now it's actually at a frequency where I notice it. It's crazy.
*trpsenator*

> Even if it did get out to mass media and it was focused on, people still wouldn't believe it. The evidence is everywhere that the migration crisis will destroy our culture, but to say so is still 'racist' and people don't want to speak up.
*deleted*


The essence of the arguments is:

* Feminists want migrants since they're naturally alpha a.k.a. *they want to be dominated by real men unlike the pussified beta western males*.

* Europe is being invaded by hordes of Muslims.

* Public security is declining because of them.

* Public opinion is afraid of talking about this issue because they could be labeled ""racist"".

Being German, having worked in a refugee camp, having read as much as every opinion piece on this topic in local/national/european media, this is an issue which I have to deal with *on a daily basis*. There are two refugee camps directly in the vicinity of my college, even one *directly on the campus*. **Keep in mind that I cherish free speech as much as the majority of RP subscribers do**.


_______
I'll start from the very beginning, even with the possibility of going off-topic for a moment: the signing of the declaration of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/). Article 14 states: Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.

Built upon that, the [Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees](http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49da0e466.html). 

Pillars of human rights and a bright and shining example of empathy between human beings, wouldn't it seem?

Now, let's go on, away from the post-WWII-era to the topic at hand, the migration crisis. 

2015 was the year with the most forcibly displaced people since founding the UNHCR, totalling at 59.5 million, expected to be more till the end of the year. Main causes were the were the Syrian civil war, the Islamic State, the ongoing war in Afghanistan, etc. They are well-known. Main hosting countries (with over a million each) are Turkey, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Iran.
[Look up the data here.](http://www.unhcr.org/56701b969.html)

The conditions of living in the refugee camps in those hosting countries are bad. While Turkey, main piece of interest, still has the best accomodation, [take a look at this report.](http://leftfootforward.org/2015/09/what-life-is-like-in-a-turkish-refugee-camp/) They live in tents, have basic access to healthcare and education, but are not allowed to work or set up residence elsewhere in Turkey, plus with the influx of more and more Iraqi and Afghan refugees, the living conditions are deteriorating. Why not flee on, towards Europe? I can understand why. Many people will disagree, but **I think that Europe and the US have a humanitarian duty towards war refugees**. And come to think about it, we aren't even taking that many. Estimations are between 1.3-1.5 million refugees for the whole of Europe. **Now talking about the total population of the European Union, that totals to 0,29%.
Germany is taking roughly a million of them, which brings it to 1,2% of the population.** Plans to redistribute the load between member states are on the way.

Seeing these quotas, I don't think we can speak of an invasion. Just putting things in perspective. *Calling this crisis a barbaric invasion essentially contradicts the basic human rights we have fought long and hard for*.

______

The outer-european refugees mainly come from [Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Map_of_the_European_Migrant_Crisis_2015.png). 

[The perpetrators of the Cologne NYE attacks were mainly of North African Origin.](http://www1.wdr.de/themen/aktuell/vorfaelle-hauptbahnhof-koeln-fakten-100.html)

Yes, both ethnic groups are Muslim, but they are not the same.

[Refugees speak about the Cologne NYE events and give their opinion, which is to find and harshly punish those responsible.](http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/inland/fluechtlinge-sprechen-ueber-koeln-es-war-wie-auf-dem-viehmarkt-14012173.html)


[There is no evidence of rising crime by refugees.](https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/fluechtlinge-kriminalitaet-101.html)

[Germany toughening up laws to punish and deport criminal migrants.](http://www.dw.com/en/how-easy-is-it-to-deport-refugees-out-of-germany/a-18966170)

[Germany's most prominent feminist, Alice Schwarzer, criticizing the patriarchal attitude of Arab and North African migrants.](http://www.aliceschwarzer.de/artikel/das-sind-die-folgen-der-falschen-toleranz-331143)

**To make it short, the German public is speaking very openly and controversially about the role women play in the Muslim culture and what happens to migrants not respecting the laws of the country.**

To be able to talk about feminism and it wanting the ""alpha refugees"", I really want to see your advanced degree in public psychology, sociology and if not, solid scientific studies which clearly make the connection you are making. I just see wild, far-fetched theories based on personal experiences on the dating market.

____

**My opinion:**

* Assholes will be assholes, regardless of where they come from

* Crime committed by a few members of a ethnic or religious group does not qualify to discredit the whole group.

* Arab men have a different socialisation than Europeans have had. We have to explain these differences to those wishing to stay here and punish and deport those who do not comply.  

* Effective control of the inner and outer borders of the European Union to exactly know who is coming and for which reasons.

* Differentiation between economic migration and refugees.

* Spreading hate spawns more hate on the receiving side.

* ***Empathy, motherfuckers, do you speak it?***

_____

**Lessons learned:**

* Censorship and ""political correctness"" are fucked up. Discussion needs freedom of speech and the ability to think about controversial opinions without condemning them. 
* Think about your own prejedices before posting (Have you met and talked with refugees/muslims? On what are you basing your opinion? Self-reflection is the key word here.)
*  Do not base a discussion about the migrant crisis upon kitchen-sink psychology.

Looking forward to an open discussion - and keep in mind - I consider myself a supporter of RP mentality.

A short story over business to business relations. If you are an entrepreneur or working towards being self employed, you need to read this post.

_______________________________________________

#Body

Let's say I had two friends, Tim and Kevin that both started separate businesses. Kevin goes and finds a single customer that will generate $1,000,000 in sales for the year. Tim goes out and find 20 customers, but each customer only generates about $50,000 dollars a year in sales.

Well let’s say I was Kevin's one customer.

 I call Kevin up and say, *”Sup bro, I got an order for you, i’ll send in the Purchase order for $100,000.”* Kevin’s ecstatic, holy shit he’s never seen so much money before in his life. He just started this business and is so excited that he landed such a lucrative contract. He spent the last 4 years going through college to get his business degree, he got married to a lovely girl, they had a kid so she decides to be a stay at home mom at least till he’s old enough for school. He’s been slaving away in corporate America for the past 8 years to pay for college and save up enough to finally start his own business. He’s got this shit on lock. He’s got the work ethic to make this deal happen and he’s going to crush it.

He takes out a mortgage on his home to front the startup loan from the bank. He heads out and buys all the materials needed to complete the job. It end up costing him $60,000 grand to complete the job, 40k isn’t a bad profile margin. From the moment he buys his material from his vendors, he has 30 days to pay them back. That’s the default pay period when business to business transaction happen, usually called Net 30.

Kevin thinks he might be able to get a bit more money out of the work though. He contacts me and tells me he underestimated the quote and it’s going to be an extra 30k to complete. Kevin assumes I’ll understand as this is his first time and I’ve been mentoring him through his whole upstart.  I let him know that’s fine and we renew the purchase order for $130,000.

Now he’s going to make 70k profit! He doesn’t waste any time. From day 1 of him picking up materials he is off putting in the time, labor, sweat and tears to get this done. He’s going to make a killing. 

Kevin and I meet at a trade show last year through mutual interest and I saw the passion in his eyes to get shit done. I knew he had the hustle, he just need a push in the right direction and some incentive to get started. In this case, $1 million in sales a year is what I offered him.

Let's talk about me a little. I’m in my 50’s, been the president of a division of a billion dollar a year corporation for about 10 years now. Our division alone put out $230 million a year in sales. Our parent company that owns us reaches 1.6 billion a year. Kevin’s 1 million dollar account doesn’t even merit a second glance in the accounting office.

Back to Kevin. He finishes up his work. Spent all his material and the job is done. At 25 days since his first material purchase, he still has just under a week to pay back his vendor at the Net 30. Not to worry, vendors know the game, sometimes it takes a bit to get the money before the last tier supplier get’s his check. He learned all this in business school.

He calls up the main office and gives my secratary the news. *”Great Mr Redwood is on vacation in the rockies for the week! When he gets back I’ll have him check out the work and you’ll be seeing the check in the mail within a few business days.”* Kevin’s ecstatic, his first big deal. He’s about to bank 70k profit in a month.

Week goes by and nothing. He calls but doesn’t reach me. The secretary tells him that I’ll be back by tomorrow to inspect the work first hand. Great, he’s had to dig into his savings a bit to pacify the vendor till the check comes in. No worries though, Kevin and I became good friends during this last year and he still has money back in the bank.

Two weeks go by and nothing, He can’t reach me as i never gave him my private cell. He calls the main office, secretary tells him that I checked it out, work was awesome and the check is in the mail. Great, he had to spend some more savings on some emergency medical issue with his kid but now he’s about to bank 70k. He’s dreaming about what this job will be like at the end of the year. The vacation he’s going to be able to treat his family too. Hell, imagine what this will be like in 2 or 3 years. Kevin is literally on cloud 9. The past 8 years has brought him to this moment.

3 weeks, nothing. He’s starting to worry. He’s out almost 60 days and his vendor is starting to send notices. He calls but nothing.

4 weeks past Net 30. same run around.

5 weeks out. still no check.

6 weeks, same.

7 weeks, same.

8, same.

9 weeks. Kevin files for bankruptcy. His vendors take him to court for the money he owes. All his assets, house, everything, seized by the banks. His wife can’t stand him. How could she marry such a loser. How could this have happened? Hell, this is illegal right?

It is absolutely, one hundred percent, positively illegal to do what i just did to Kevin. But good luck trying to take my $230 million dollar a year company to court while you are in the middle of filing for bankruptcy and have no other income source, Kevin. 

__________________________________________________________________

If you think this story is bullshit or this would never happen in modern day America, I can be assured that you’ve never ran a business longer than a few years. Or, you at least have the privilege of not working in my line of work. I’m 25, I’ve been doing what i do for 10 years, I’ve seen it happen twice. My father has seen it happen more time than he can count and so have many others that I have been mentored by. 

My father sat me down one day after he got a call from a company and he said, *""Clint, one day you are going to get a call from a customer or new company. They are going to offer you more money than you've ever seen before in your life. It will be like holding a winning lottery ticket in your hand. All the shit you can do with that amount of money will flash before you. It might be equal to or even dwarf our entire sales for the year. Everything in you will tell you to take that deal.*

*Don't ever take that deal.""*

A large corporation with tons of power goes out and finds some chump that’s eager and driven, they offer him a deal he can’t refuse, only to burn him, not pay, and there is shit he can do about it. They hold such an immense amount of power and influence over you that you can not possibly take them to court. They will drown you in legal bullshit and it will cost you more than you can imagine. 

Now, that 100k, that’s nothing. That’s like a week of sales for most small business. As in 5-50 employee sized businesses. I use 100k because to most ordinary people, that’s a lot of money. Oh, and that extra 30k Kevin thought he was getting out of me. Ha, whatever Kevin wants to hear is what Kevin will hear. I’m Kevin’s #1 sycophant, I’m the *”Yes”* man. 

In business, the more charming and the more enthusiastic a person is, the more you should be skeptical of them. It’s sometimes hard to identify a con man vs just some guy that’s really passionate/charismatic, that takes time and experience. But a good businessman weighs his options and never makes split decisions. A con man will tell you everything you want to hear without a second thought. If you want to know if you are getting conned, present them a serious issue that needs to be discussed, in this case a 30k quoting mistake. if it’s answered in a minute or less, you’ve got problems. 

Conmen talk from an emotionally drive narrative not logic. They will play off your vibes and how you react, not through logic or planned out thoughts. They will have a basic plan for the con, as in me offering a million for enticing Kevin. But their delivery is always rooted in emotional manipulation and getting you to shut down your logical thought process. If you feel emotion, happiness, sadness, anything when making a business deal. Stop, don't make a decision, calm yourself, leave if need be, hell take a week off if you have to. You must be grounded and level when you make giant decisions. Meditate if need be.

The company I saw get burned, they bought 1 million dollars in equipment and material to get a job from a very, VERY reputable corporation. You are probably imagining some slimball president of some shady corporation that could be morally and ethically relatable to Skynet if it was ran by Saul Goodman from Breaking Bad. 

You’d be dead wrong. 

This company that burnt them was a company every single one of you knows of. Hell, half of you probably own an appliance by them. I’ll just repeat that again though if it didn’t set in though. They spent $1,000,000 and didn’t get a dime, filed for bankruptcy a few months later. By a company that pretty much all of you know and trust to make good products.

Oh, and that company that got burnt for 1 million? Ya, that wasn’t some dude like Kevin. That was a company that was in business since the 80’s.


*“So what went wrong? Fuck, this is hella illegal!”* Doesn’t matter what is legal or illegal, it’s what you can get away with. You think laws stop people from doing things? Fuck no, we break laws all the time, the only thing that stops people fucking one another over is if they can get away with it or not.

Bullpill advice would be, take them to court, try to get your money out of them. It will be alright. We believe in you and we are here for you.*(random people on the internet that he probably tried to consolidate with or advice some friend gave him)*.

I’ll tell you right now that advice is worth less than the air and calories it took to say it. here’s the redpill advice. Kevin, you fucked up. You let your emotions and the alluring of dollar signs sway your decision making skills. You saw $1,000,000 written out and said, *”Holy shit, One million dollars, sign me up.”* You let emotion, lust and greed trump logic and planning. You saw a big shinny number, from a company you know and love, that everyone knows and loves, that’s been around forever and you took that as merit for them to be a trustworthy client. Instead of sitting down and looking ahead of what they could do to you if you accept their deal. You thought you were playing blackjack when they were playing chess. You made one move and thought you won the game and didn’t think anything past that. You broke the #1 golden rule of business.

#Never have all your eggs in one basket

Let's take a look back at Tim. I bet you forgot about Tim. In the amount of time Kevin went from 25k in the bank and owning a home to being homeless, Tim cleared 5 orders of 20k each, cost him 15k in materials each, resulting in 25k profit and 100K sales for the month. Good job Tim.

Why? because none of Tim’s customers have power over him. If I tried to pull the shit that I pulled on Kevin, Tim can fall back onto his other accounts to support his business and life style, and have the money to take me to court in the process. 

Tim, can’t be fucked with, because Tim has abundance.

________________________________________________________

#Lessons learned

This is just one rule of business that I’ve learned through the years being mentored by some truly alpha men. I never correlated it with abundance mentality till TRP though. But it is the #1 rule of business and it’s one they constantly drill into my head. The shit these men have shared with me and taught me is invaluable and stuff you can’t find in textbooks. It’s only learned through experience. Textbooks will teach you what to do if everyone plays by the rules. It won’t teach you a damn thing when it comes to playing the game with people that break the rules.

There is a lot of benefits to the golden rule than foreseeing getting fucked over. For instance it’s not always some dickbag trying to fuck you. Maybe one of your customers goes out of business just due to the economy. Trust me, they won’t tell you they are going under, a lot of times you won’t even know, their purchase orders will just stop coming in or they just go radio silent. If they were 25% of your business, you’ve got problems. You may not go under but you will be laying employees off or taking a pay cut yourself.

At our company we tried to make sure none of our customers gets above 10% of our sales for the year. 5-7% is the sweet zone. If you can manage that, no customer can fuck with you. you should track these number religiously, because trust me, your customers know how much money they pay you a year. And they will use that number to throw their weight around. If you don’t know your % then you don’t know what kind of negotiating power you have. Basic Sun Tzu teachings, *”Know yourself and know your enemy.”*

If rule # 1 is never have all your eggs in one basket, then #2 is never let your customer know how many baskets you have or how big their basket is*(also a Sun Tzu teaching)*. Customers will straight up ask you sometimes, *”How much of our work is your business.”* If they are above 10%, your answer to that question is always, *”I have no idea off the top of my head, I’d have to speak with my accountant on that.”*. They can’t use what they don’t know against you. If it’s below 10%, you tell them exactly what their % is so they know they can’t fuck with you. 

Basic misdirection and power play.

If a customer is over 25% of your business, you should be sweating bullets every day, you should be losing sleep and pulling your fucking hair out. You should not be eating till you secure another account and drop that 25% to 10%. At my company we have dynamic employees, we don’t have dedicated sales reps as sometimes sales are not what we need. When customers hit 15-20%, sales reps head out the door looking for new work or we contact current customers for more work to level the playing field. Growing horizontally is always better than vertically. This is also why consumer goods are great to get into, then you literally have thousands of customers that don’t even equate to 0.1% of your sales. No one owns you and no one can bully you.

If a customer knows they are 35%+ of your work, I don't give a shit who's name is on the sign out front. I don't care who or how many people own shares of your company. If a company is 35%+ of your total work, they now own your business. They just may or may not know it yet. This the most important thing I can ever teach you about business. You become a slave to your customer the moment you are not in a position of Fuck You.

**This post is the first of two. The second is called, *""The Dark Rule: How To Fuck Someone Over In Business""*. I strongly suggest you read it as it contrasts the opposite side of the moral spectrum. You can find it in my post history or search in the sidebar.**

*I’ve been wanting to make post on business for a while now but find it hard to separate and distance myself without revealing too much personal information.

I usually write based off of a comment or question i come across so if you have any questions or topics you’d be interested in me covering, feel free to ask away.

**Edit:** 

It's came to light in the comment section that there are many other pitfalls that could have been avoided by Kevin if he took more preventative measures. While I am aware of them, I felt adding them would detract from the main point of the topic. I solely wanted to revolve the article around diversification and horizontal growth.

I'm not making too long a post about this, it's just a rant to get the word out asap. There's also a [good post](https://archive.is/pKEjR) from a couple years back when the law was only being proposed.

Naturally the law is bullshit, that'll never be used against women, despite manipulation being their everything.""Honey you don't make enough money."" this kind of comment won't be considered and yet ""Honey, you're getting too fat."" Will be considered abuse, even though both comments could be said by either sex. You might thinking I'm crazy, but really, I was just watching women's TV, because I slept in late because of a cold, went and had my breakfast and lo and behold a DV ""victim"", complained about her husband of 8 years, literally it was him insulting her appearance and his general disapproval of her ""Getting dressed up and going out with the girls"", regardless of what he said, because honestly it sounds like something the feminist narrative write. Even then she just left, but now in hindsight it was DV.

Ultimately all this is down to feminism, money, globalism et cetera

I'm just gonna quit while I'm ahead and am not too angry. 

On a positive note, here is [Erin Pizzey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnUwxxijr3g), she created the first domestic violence shelter in the modern world, because she was concerned with DV itself, as opposed to man-hating feminism, it's a good video to watch and she's a genuinely lovely person.


**Lessons learned:** Brits need to think about expat, need to leave the west behind, if you're white go to a country that white worships, which is pretty much most of Asia.

**EDIT:** Here is the link to the video I watched this morning, [1:40](http://www.itv.com/thismorning/hot-topics/mental-abuse-coercive-control-the-hidden-side-of-domestic-violence) they ask her what was the pyschological abuse she suffered, that in her words was worse than the physical violence, the answer is he insulted her appearance, how she managed the children and the house, and going out with friends.

>Coercive behaviour is:a continuing act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten their victim.”

>The perpetrator and victim have to be personally connected when the incidents took place-meaning that at the time the incidents took place they were in an intimate personal relationship (whether they lived together or not)or they lived together and were family members, or they lived together and had previously been in an intimate personal relationship.It is not necessary for the perpetrator and victim to stillbe cohabiting or in a relationship when the offence is reported as long as the incidents took place when they were “personally connected”, and after the offence came into force.If they were not personally connected, or the incidents took place after a relationship/cohabitation,the stalking and harassment legislation may apply",1004,4,0.2978000044822693,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first",1

**Summary:** So youth-part of the Liberals suggests men should have the same option to opt out of a pregnancy as a woman

**Body:** The idea is that men should be able to reject parenthood up untill the 18th week (for as long as women can have an abortion without special circumstances). 

Note that this is most likely mostly to get attention as the same party suggested that necrophilia and incest should be legalized a few weeks back. Still the motion put the ""equality"" principle to a test and shines some light on the fact that men have next to no power when it comes to deciding if they want to become a parent or not (wrap it up boys and dont let anyone close to your condoms).

He also points out that this would obviously be an irreversible decision, so you wouldnt be able to change your mind once your kid is successful.

To me this is a very sound and logical idea and the fact that it plays into the ""gender-equality"" ideal makes it even harder for feminist to try to denounce it. Im obviously not naive enough to believe they wont try.

So what's your opinion, do you believe it could work?

Gentlemen I would like to introduce you to something to always consider, especially if she has a cat or cats.

Toxoplasmosis makes women crazy.  Batshit crazy.  You won't know she has it, only that it lasts a long time and is hard for the body to get rid of.  During that time she will appear to be nuts. Fly off on tantrums, crying, irrational thought, jealousy, you name it.  (sound familiar?)  It affects men, too. It makes us aggressive and also nuts, but appears to affect us less.  The extent is unclear.

If they are outdoor cats, chances are they have killed mice or other rodents. Rodents affected by Toxoplasma Gondii will exhibit weird behavior.  They will show no fear when confronted with a cat.  Normally sight of a cat would send them scurrying.  With toxoplasmosis, they offer themselves as food.  That's how the cat contracts it.

If the cat ever brings the carcass in and/or poops in a litter box or even the bush under the bedroom window, chances are that loony girl you've plated has acute Toxoplasmosis. Run.

Today we’re talking about money, specifically how you can become a millionaire. No inner game fluff talk. This post gives you all specific industries and tactics where millionaires are created. If you're in your 20s you'll find this very interesting. Imagine if you had a million dollars? Yea, we’re going there today.

#Why You Should Make as Much Money As Possible

Despite all the bullshit you hear, you should do everything in your power to get as much money as possible.

If there’s one problem you want, it’s too much money. If I had to choose, I’d rather be a rich beta bux than a broke chad. Money buys options.

I hate hearing stories about how rich people are the most miserable people in the world. Are they serious? They can pay for support, when you’re broke you don’t have anything. Being rich means you have the resources to help yourself and to help the world.

**Why traditional advice sucks**

You know what happens if you Google, “How to become a millionaire”?

You get bullshit results about the 7 habits of millionaires and how you should be reading and waking up at 5am...

But none of that advice is actually helpful in making you a millionaire. And I swear to God, I’ll kill you if you post in the comment that we should do surveys to make money...

We're talking about real money: Fuck You Money.

I’m talking about **building millionaire dollar assets** that you can sell one day. Millionaire fastlane style money.

This is the end goal:

You should have enough money to say whatever you want, do whatever you want, all with utter confidence because you know you can financially support yourself through anything.

There are so many benefits to having money. With money you can make other people happy. You can live anywhere you want. You get almost an unlimited number options available to you.

**But how do you make Fuck You Money?**

Yes, the concept is simple, add value. But it begs the question, what kind of value?

This post is going to be about the biggest opportunities out there for young men to make serious money. Please add your suggestions as well to the comments below for potential careers.

Before we start I want to give you real statistics on millionaires. Yes, it's very possible for you to become a millionaire if you work. In fact, most millionaires are first generation. Check out these statistics.

**Millionaire Statistics:**

* According to the book The Millionaire Next Door, only 20% of millionaires inherited their wealth. The other 80% earned their cash on their own. ^1
* Most modern American millionaires today (about 80%) are first-generation millionaires. ^1
* The average millionaire goes bankrupt at least 3.5 times ^1
* Only 20% of millionaires are retirees. Around 80% still go to work. ^1
* Half of all millionaires are self-employed or own a business. ^2


**Breakdown of Millionaires**

In the USA, according to highly successful entrepreneur & best-selling author Brian Tracy, here’s the breakdown of those who earn $1m annually:

* 74% – Entrepreneurs
* 10% – Highly Skilled Professional
* 10% – Corporate Executives
* 5% – Sales Professionals
* 1% – Rock Stars, Athletes, Lottery Winners, etc.

Notice how most millionaires are regular entrepreneur. You'll see shortly that finance is one of the best and safest industries to make a fortune but most millionaires you'll see are entrepreneurs.

Now we're I can show you the really good stuff. I spent a lot of time researching and linking this for you.

Below are industries in which I’ve read or heard of industries where people are making serious income. These are industries that you want to look into. The number one rule is always to follow the money.

Don’t look at how people say they’ve become millionaires. Look at what they’ve created. Normally this would take you hours to research, but I've already compiled some the best industries and markets for you to make money below.

#How to Make Fuck You Money

**1. Selling Courses Online**

By far the most common thing I see these days. Guys like Ramit Sethi, Derek Halpern, Brian Dean, Neil Patel, Udemy profs, are killing it in this space. These guys have 7 figure businesses just on selling $2000 courses.

All making millions of dollars. And Courses have some of the best margins of all time. Crazy industry right, especially as more and more millennial lose faith in College. And as relevant courses start to be exclusively online. For instance, there’s no University for SEO. Online is your best source for good information.

Examples:

* [Ramit Sethi: Real-World Blueprint for a $5-Million Week] (http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/03/04/5-million-week/)
* [Derek Halpern: How I Built A 7 Figure Business - Social Triggers](http://socialtriggers.com/exclusive/audience/)
* [Neil Patel: How I Built a 7 Figure SEO Agency](https://www.quicksprout.com/2013/01/10/how-i-built-a-seo-agency-to-7-figures-a-year/)
* [Udemy: Alun Hill](https://www.udemy.com/user/alunhill/) has a dozen udemy courses bringing him tons of money
* [Udemy: Rob Percival](https://www.udemy.com/user/robpercival/) hosts the best-selling programming courses
* [Nat Eliason: Making 53K from programming for marketers](http://www.nateliason.com/life-after-sumome/)

I believe selling courses online is one of the best-emerging markets out there for those who have something valuable to teach. There are several benefits to courses. You can charge very high price tags like Ramit Sethi ($2000+) and you can keep the same course running for years. So you create a recurring revenue. What the pros do is 4 times a year they open their courses to the public. So they create massive revenues for themselves. Even the pros on Udemy have a constant stream of revenue coming as new students sign up. Udemy takes around 50%, but you’re still making a lot of money.

**2. Affiliate Marketing**

Affiliate marketing is mostly about your traffic-generation skills. That's what you have to master as an affiliate. Once you do, you can drive traffic to high paying affiliate programs of your choice.

Here are some great examples:

* [Pat Flynn Income Report with 150k a month from affiliate marketing](http://www.smartpassiveincome.com/my-january-2016-monthly-income-report/)
* [Matthew WoodWard Income Report with 12K per month from affiliate marketing](http://www.matthewwoodward.co.uk/income-report/monthly-income-growth-traffic-report-february-2016/)
* [EoFire Making 36K per month from affiliate marketing](http://www.eofire.com/income30/)
* [List of top earning blogs](http://onlineincometeacher.com/money/top-earning-blogs/)
* [Nichesiteazon making 3k/month](http://www.nichesiteazon.com/may-2015-income-report/)

Note: I’m having trouble finding public examples, but I know from first-hand experience that there a lot of SEO experts out there making 6 figure incomes from affiliate marketing in the health and gambling experience. It’s all about driving traffic to highly profitable niches like insurance, etc.

**3.Selling a Product to a Loyal Customer Base**

People either have great products or if they’re popular bloggers they leverage their fanbase and sell them stuff. Most famous bloggers are able to cash in on their fanbase with a product.

Examples:

* [Chris from Good Looking Loser on making 3 million in sales from his e-commerce business.](http://www.gll-getalife.com/get-paid/20-things-ive-learned-from-making-over-3-million-in-e-commerce-sales) If he sold that company he’d easily be a millionaire.
* [Victor Pride Making 10k/month 2013](https://boldanddetermined.com/how-i-make-10k-per-month-online/) that was 3 years ago, I wouldn’t be surprised if he’s making 5x that now.
* [Eofire making 500k from their freedom journal](http://www.eofire.com/income30/)

Most bloggers will sell information products, they’re high margin and don’t require updates like software. The biggest challenge is building a loyal audience and getting good traffic from Google.

**4. Sales for products of $5K to $500K value**

Selling medical equipment, industrial farming equipment, manufacturing equipment. Anything with a big price tag means you can get a big commission. Sales Salaries can be vary high and if you save well you can become a millionaire.

* [Medical Equipment Sales, Average salary is 153K in 2015 survey](https://www.medreps.com/medical-sales-careers/medical-equipment-sales-salary-report/)

Selling yachts and other expensive luxury/equipment items will net you great cash. I’d love if someone could post specific industries that are great for sales. Selling Solar Panels is also a great market to get into.

**5. Programming (Python, Swift, Javascript a good programmer is always in demand)**

Most programmers per se aren’t millionaires, but a lot of them who’ve created SAAS companies have become so. You also get an amazing salary if you work for a big tech company.

* [Working at Google in programming will net you anywhere from 100-160k per year](https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Salary/Google-San-Francisco-Salaries-EI_IE9079.0,6_IL.7,20_IM759.htm)

**6.Finance (banking, Hedge Funds)**

This is the BIGGEST source of Millionaires according to [Wealth Insights] (http://www.lifehack.org/articles/money/the-top-industries-2014-that-created-millionaires.html). If you want to make do Finance. Despite the long hours, it’s your best bet.

* [Juniors make around 100-200k.](http://www.careers-in-finance.com/ibsal.htm)
* [Seniors make 200k-3M](http://www.careers-in-finance.com/ibsal.htm)

If you make it to a senior position as an investment banker you’ll be set for life. Out of all the options in this thread, this is where the most millionaires have been made in History.

**7. Virtual Reality Development**

VR is an emerging market. It’s a risk to jump in, but you might just make your millions here. For example, Palmer Lucky is worth 700M and he’s only 23… Obviously, it’s high risk, but if you’re into tech this might be the place for you to focus on.

* [Palmer Lucky’s Net Worth of 700M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmer_Luckey)

I’m sure we’ll see more millionaires come from this market in the next couple years.

**8. E-commerce (Selling on Amazon or your own product on Shopify)**

There are tons of high earners from Amazon and selling products. When you get the #1 ranking spot on Amazon, as long you get 500+ reviews you can do really well.

* [Theamazingseller making 12k profit per month](http://theamazingseller.com/tas-042-income-report-april-2015-32559-06-amazon-fba-sales/)
* [Stephen Somers selling on Ebay and Amazon making 7 figure in revenue](https://mixergy.com/interviews/stephen-somers-turned-selling-stuff-amazon-art-form/)

**9. Real Estate**

Real estate has always been a place where people have made their fortune. Obviously, everyone thinks of Donald Trump, who’s now a billionaire from his real estate entrepreneurship. There’s also a lot of other brokers out there that are doing great:

* [Donald Trump with a net worth of 4-10 Billion](http://forbes.com/profile/donald-trump/)
* [Frederik Edlund, New York’s #1 Realtor worth 30M](http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/business-executives/fredrik-eklund-net-worth/)
* [Robert Ringer was making 1M/year through real estate, he outlines it in his amazing book](http://www.amazon.com/Winning-Through-Intimidation-Robert-Ringer/dp/0449207862)

**10. Flipping Land**

I’ve read that buying vacant land, splitting it and selling it a decent way to make money. There’s a good Reddit post on it [here](http://archive.is/O0EVz).

* [Check out this book for more information](http://www.amazon.com/The-Land-Flipper-Turning-Dollars-ebook/dp/B01CEZLS04)

Not sure if there have been millionaires, but I’ve read that it’s pretty good money. This part needs more information, though.

**11. SAAS Businesses**

Create a software as a service for a specific industry. Basically, most big tech companies are SAAS. Think of PayPal, Facebook, Twitter, Kickstarter, all the unicorns all started software businesses. But I want to focus on niche software, like lead pages, mail chimp, etc. There are also a ton of niche software that you don’t know about that make a lot of revenue.

* [Brightedge making 50M revenue](https://mixergy.com/interviews/jim-yu-brightedge/)

* [Hollis Carter selling software to school making $2M in revenue](https://mixergy.com/interviews/hollis-carter-velocity-interview/)
* [Wufoo selling for 35M](https://mixergy.com/wufoo-sold-for-35-mil-heres-the-story-behind-its-success/)

* [Marketo earning 210M/year](http://investors.marketo.com/releasedetail.cfm?releaseid=954126)

So many millionaires have been made me in this sector. That’s why everyone always tells you to learn to program.

**12.Manufacturing**

I have a family member who became a millionaire in manufacturing. It’s niche but he started his own window frame manufacturing company. Had really great timing in the economy and now he’s one major window frame suppliers in North America. However, I think most manufacturing these days comes from China so I’d be weary of this industry.

* [Aakash Chemicals and Dye-Stuffs earning 40M in sales per year](http://eventualmillionaire.com/millionaire-story-aakash-shah/)


**13. Garbage and trash recycling.**

I can think of Brian Scudamore of  1-800 got junk. It’s a boring but necessary industry that no one wants to do. That’s usually a good sign. He’s worth 150M.

* [Brian Scudamore's 150M story](https://mixergy.com/interviews/brian-scudamore-1800gotjunk-interview/)

**14. Fashion**

Extremely difficult, but many founders of Zara and H&M have all become billionaires. Clothing is pretty high margin. However, a lot of entrepreneurs have tapped in niches to make really great revenues.

* [Nasty Gal Vintage Clothing earning 100M+](https://growthhackers.com/growth-studies/nasty-gal-kills-it-ecommerce-how-they-did-it)
* [Mod Cloth Plus Size Clothing earning 150M+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ModCloth)

**15. Mining and oil**

Start a fracking company. Sell it. Make Millions. In 2010, the fracking industry generated $76 billion in revenues for the USA.

* [Go Frac earning ~65M per month](http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-oil-slowdown-idUSL1N0Z11CM20150618)

Energy is a very lucrative but risky business. Oil prices are doing awful right now, so it's not the best time to start your fracking company. 

EDIT: As everyone is mentioning in the comments, starting a fracking company is shitty way to make money right now...  

***

**Conclusion:**

Go out and enter an industry where Millionaires are actually made! It comes down to building million dollar assets that you can sell. For those interested in hearing more business case studies a great podcast to listen to is Mixergy. Andrew Warner often interviews very high earners and talks specifically about business, revenue, strategy. A lot of the examples from here are from Mixergy interviews.

#I want to hear from you! What industries do you think are the most lucrative for young guys? Can you add an example?

I’ll be updating this post to include good comments. Everyone reading wants to hear your thoughts so post a comment now.

A good start to spreading information and ideas, even sometimes bringing them together and making them happen. But ultimately the TRP can sometimes be little more than a circle jerk. It happens, as with all things. 

Plus there are those who try to find some ""good"" in the TRP as it applies to society and people. I think that's a waste of time. It's fine to wear a mask of fakeness and deceit while among the masses. Most people can't handle the truth of human nature or its implications and that's we are so ready and wanting to dress it up in ideals and falsehoods that we call morality and religion. 

Remember, humans at their base are animals that follow mammalian pattern by and large. We've just put a fancy spin on being an evolved ape and dressed it up with the artifices of civilization, religion, and subjective morality. 

You need to become the best predator you can be as most people are prey. Acquiring physical prowess and monetary ability enhances your ability to be selective in garnering mates and resources. Sitting on your ass playing video games and eating Doritos is the pathway to heart disease, celibacy, and erectile dysfunction. Look for the smart and easy ways to big things and make money. Let suckers, BP, and betas do the hard work, sweating, and preferably dying. They are a virtually unlimited resource as long as they get their cable TV, sugary foods, and religion on Sundays they don't do anything with or about besides going to a church and thinking that's what god wants while they engage in unbridled apathy to their fellow human beings. Lemmings are at least honest and thus deserve more respect than these types. 

Stop looking for answers in the offerings of professional entertainers, that's what Lemmings and betas do. Start working on creating your own answers and offerings. Start building your skill and ability base. Don't settle in at a company and punch a clock because one day the company many realize you are overpaid and better off being replaced (for them anyways, fuck you). 

The greatest men never settled for a 9-5 or did things the ""traditional way"" (i.e. Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, Temujin, etc. etc. [yes I realize I just named a bunch of genocidal murdering guys, it's how history works typically]). They innovated, took chances, and made themselves into something great. An Xbox One won't do that for you. 

Be the object in motion, gaining mass and energy. When others are sitting in a bar rotting, be at the gym or be learning a new skill and ability. Don't let your employers define you beyond the money they hand you. They are too inferior to matter ultimately. 

And above all else. Only God, a judge, and a jury of your peers can judge you, and that's ultimately up to you to decide (unless God is real, because if God is real, you and I might be Grade A+++ fucked). Worthless people will always seek to have influence and power over your life. Don't let them, there's no need to. If they don't put money in your hand, power in life, or pussy in your bed (and/or dick, hey everyone has their thing), they don't even begin to mean anything. They are worth less than the dirt on the bottom of your shoes. Accept it and take joy in it. 

Life can be hard, life tends to be unfair to most people, and tragedy does await most as well. Have fun, fuck the world, and get yours. Because there is either a God and setup of divine judgment or there isn't. And if there isn't, then fuck those atheists, they are edible. 

One thing I enjoy telling some people is ""I'm honest, I'm ethical, and I'm evil."" Or if I'm feeling really cheek ""the only thing keeping me from becomming a cannibal serial killer is my legal license."" Both of which are sort of true, and sort of false, just depends on the day I guess. 

TRP is where you start, but how you finish? Well that's up to you really. Don't wait on others for answers, at best they'll offer some direction but no results. Because you are the one who creates your results. Detach from the morality around you, and start making your own.",933,2,0.323199987411499,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck",3

Tried to re-post at relationships and they deleted it instantly. No reason provided.

Apparently, the fact that my story resonated with so many people is threatening in some way. Threatening to whom, I'll leave you to decide.

So I'm reposting here. Enjoy.

I was in the US Army. I was stationed in South Korea and I met a girl while I was back home on leave visiting friends. She was really cute and I liked her a lot. We clicked instantly. She opened up to me about how her dad had raped her when she was 9. My heart went out to her and we kept in touch for several months even after I left to go back to Korea. A relationship blossomed and we eventually ended up married. A year later, she was pregnant. I was overjoyed. We both were. 9 months later, my son was born. Within a couple months of his birth, the new-baby joyous haze had faded and postpartum depression set in with my wife. I did what I could to help lift her spirits but I was also working 12-hour days and sometimes weekends because, ya know... it's the Army. When my son was 6 months old, I got the news that my unit was going to deploy to Iraq. We were sent to the Fort Irwin National Training Center in the Mojave desert to train. While I was there, I got a call from a friend back at my unit. He had seen my wife in a Military Police vehicle with my son.

I was shattered. I was thousands of miles away and powerless to do anything and didn't know what was wrong or what might have happened to her and my son. I knew she had been in a fragile state. What could be wrong?!? I was absolutely frantic for days. She wasn't answering her phone. Worse yet, we were doing training exercises and I had lost my phone charger at some point and my phone had died. I called again from a friend's phone and left a voicemail with his phone number in the hopes that she would call back. Finally, on day 3 after hearing this news, she calls his phone. He runs over to me and brings me his cell. The wind is blasting sand into my face and it's 110 degrees outside. I ask her what's wrong and what the hell happened?!?

She tells me she wants a divorce... I'm dumbfounded. This is out of nowhere and I'm in total shock. Turns out she wasn't in a Military Police vehicle because there she was in trouble... She was fucking the MP. Of course, she couldn't very well leave my months-old son by himself so she was carting him along with her while she was doing it. It had been going on for months, even before I left. There's pictures of her and him and baby son with a tent in the background. They'd gone camping. Asked her where my son had slept and she matter-of-factly stated that he'd been in the tent with them. Nevertheless, I try to work things out for the sake of our son, but she's adamant and wants the divorce. Divorces are never quick so some tense months went by... but finally the divorce is granted. The next morning, I wake up and she is gone. She left our son with me, got on a plane, she's gone.

So there I was, a 22-year-old soldier who is suddenly a single dad of a now 10-month-old baby and I'm supposed to get on a plane to Iraq the following week. I didn't know what to do. So I grab my son, put him in his car seat, and drive to my unit's headquarters and sit down with my Commander and explain the situation. My son's mother has left and gone back to her parent's house, my own parents both work full-time along with parenting my mentally handicapped sister and can't possibly take on my son as well. So my CO says he'll have to consult with the Battalion Commander about what to do.

I nervously wait a few days. Then, 6 days before we're supposed to deploy to Iraq, my CO comes back and tells me that they're going to put me out of the Army on an honorable discharge. In a way, I was relieved because my son was my first priority. But I also have never felt that guilty in my entire life. I had trained with these guys in my unit for years preparing to go to war. Now I'm not going at all. I was a sergeant so I had soldiers who were underneath me that got transferred to another squad. I felt like they were being abandoned by me and there was nothing I could do to stop it.

Then, on the day my unit is leaving, my company is getting on the buses to drive to the airport. My CO hands me a clipboard and asks me to check off each soldier as they get on the bus. So I did. Each one shook my hand and wished me luck as he got on the bus. I watched every face go by and shook every hand. My CO was the last on the bus. He took the clipboard from me, I saluted him, and he shook my hand and got on the bus and they drove away. Suddenly, I was standing in front of the headquarters building with my son napping in his carrier on the pavement beside me and I was totally and utterly alone. I sat down on the pavement and (I have to sit my manhood aside here for a moment) cried harder than I have ever cried in my entire life. I had never felt so painfully guilty and so alone.

Three months later, I was honorably discharged from the Army and on my way home. I got myself a place, got set up with a community college and started pursuing a degree while doing the single dad thing. I was recovering and putting my life together because I had to. For him.

Three months into this new life I'd set up for myself, a sheriff's deputy shows up at my front door. He hands me a manila envelope with court papers in it. I'd been served. My ex-wife was suing for custody.

Now, let's pause for a moment. So far, all of this is a rather unfortunate set of circumstances and you're probably wondering ""So where's the FU? This doesn't sound like it's your fault."" Up until now, you'd be right. So here it is. Here's where I fucked up: For the first month, I didn't even get a lawyer. I just called her and asked her what in the world she was doing. Couldn't we work this out? Fuck-up number 1. Always get a lawyer if you get a damn court summons. No exceptions. Your lawyer needs time to prepare your case. The longer you take to get one, the more ill-prepared he/she is. So finally I figure this out because things just aren't getting worked out. So I get a lawyer. The lawyer of course tells me to cease communication with her and that all communication will now go through him to her lawyer. But, in my hubris, I did not listen. I called her due to my emotional state being so out of whack. The conversation was somewhat peaceable at first but turned sour. At some point, she asked me if I had firearms in my house. I responded that of course I did to protect our son she abandoned and blah blah blah... This is fuck-up #2. She recorded it. This recording was the central piece of evidence she used in court against me. Of course the gun was locked up but she claimed he was in danger. Never ever disobey your lawyer and never base legal decisions on emotion.

Another six months passed and then a judge awarded sole physical custody of my son to my ex-wife despite the fact that I had been taking care of him alone this entire time since she left us both. This sounds crazy, I know. However, we're talking about a southern bible belt judge who was golf buddies with my ex-father-in-law. So yeah... that was that. While the system is a bit of joke when it comes to father's rights, I ultimately lost my son because I fucked up.

TL;DR - Guy in army gets cheated on by his wife and loses his wife, then his career, and then, due to his own hubris, his son.

Short story:

I had a female guest stay at my place (I do Airbnb sometimes). After a couple of drinks, we started to discuss certain topics.

One of them was male/female sexuality.

I told her that women could not, and would not, think outside of ""What does he HAVE that makes him attractive"".

I also stated that, if women were really passionate creatures, then they would be far more open and straight forward about physical contact. Be it a hug, kiss or more.

She told me, with a nonchalant gesture and an arrogant voice:

""If we get horny, we can satisfy ourselves. We dont need a man for that"".

I was totally dumb founded by her answer.

Women like her (she was low level gold digger, chasing looser kids just to stay with them and give em some pussy whilst enjoying material gains) are SO COLD, they would prefer to have a rubber dildo in their twat, than to have the warm body of a man kiss, touch, caress and embrace them.

I am still struck by her words, but more than words, her attitude.

Women do not want men, even for sex, when the itch needs to be scratched. Sex for a woman is either going lesbian as a fantasy, or a tool for gaining money.

He won the genetic lottery and was objectively the best looking, most athletic and physically appealing kid in high school at 6'4"" and 190lbs at 8% bodyfat. The girls gosspied and giggled with each other because he was great in bed and could make them orgrasm with his 7"" girthy dick alone. That girl you oogled at in chemistry because she was cute? Chad fucked her.

In college he took home a 9 every night he wanted, had threesomes with them on the weekends for a total n-count well into the 100s (he's not sure because he stopped counting around 90), yet still got a 4.0 GPA taking 20+ hours a semester and playing on the football team.

He's now a major player in the oil and gas industry. As a salesman he took home a million his first year (and his first 18 year old supermodel), won accolades from his coworkers and bosses and was well liked by everyone, especially the coworkers he was banging. Despite every girl he's ever fucked chasing him he refuses to commit thanks to fresh 18 year olds to alpha-widow every year for the rest of his life.

Men get discouraged knowing they will never be Chad. Regretting the years in high school and college, forever losing the chance to be the popular guy and athlete, or blindly searching for power and the way to bankroll six or seven figures in the business world, they give up and resort to a life of gray non-existence.

Yet you're here on TRP because you want to be better than what you are right now. You will never be Chad, but that's okay. Chad doesn't exist in reality. Chad is an archetype of the manosphere's creation. He's the collective ideal we all strive toward (and dangerously worship in some cases).

Women have always treated me like shit.

Yeah, I got some occasional lays but I had to go to the ends of the earth to get them. No girl ever approached me and said lets fuck unless she ugly, obese or very old. I had to go out and approach thousands of woman to get lays. 

I've gotten tricked by countless women who hinted they would give up pussy yet never did. Even when I did get laid, the women would always act like they were doing me a huge favor and I should worship them. In the end it was always a shitty experience. Even if they orgasmed they never gave a shit if I did.

Tinder and online dating? At one point I had thousands of matches (from auto-liking) and I could easily go out on a date with a new girl each day. Yet the majority of girls I met would never want to fuck and all wanted a relationship before giving up the pussy. Even the hottest looking girls on tinder looked horrible in person. It was a massive scam and a huge waste of time at best.

I don't know where this Chad bullshit originated from but I say with full confidence that women treat everyone like shit. And why should they? Even the ugliest woman has an endless amount of dick to choose from. It's doubtful any woman is going to treat any one guy special.

Would you treat any woman as special if you had and endless amount of woman who wanted to buy you free dinners and fuck you?




Edit: Parting thoughts.

-- James Fenimore Cooper, The Pathfinder, 1840 

The natural beta is insincere, untrustworthy, self-serving.  These are some of the survival techniques his reptilian brain came up with.  You can see it in the eyes, in timidity, in the limp handshake, the poor posture.  You can knock over a beta's disguises with the wind of a butterfly's wing.  You can blow his frame with a look.   No they aren't necessarily bad people.  But they are unpredictable and therefore about as safe as keeping a monkey as a pet.  They set their boundaries with a flamethrower and are dangerous when scorned.

This is no cause to wrong them.  But I have in spades and they handed me the keys.  

The first time was when I myself was still pretty blue pill but had some solid alpha tendencies.  I was probably about 26 and married 5 years.  I met a man, we'll call him Dave, while moonlighting at a convenience store.  Dave was a gigantic fat turd.  He simpered like a child, shook hands like a noodle, had nothing intelligent to say, grinned endlessly. Then he says ""My wife is picking me up later.""  

""Wife."" I thought.  ""I will have sex with her.""  Not as a plan, not as an expression of arrogance or hubris.  But as an immediate instinct.   Even without redpill theory my gut told me that this man couldn't possibly satisfy a woman.  And I knew I could.  She comes in, she's not too bad, a chubby 5 by my standards today.  A hole and a heartbeat by my standards then.  My wife gave it up all the time and with enthusiasm, but I had the 7 year itch that never went away.  And remember, I'm literally Hitler.  I love to cheat and  I love when women cheat with me.  It's white hot sex of the highest tingles.

So I befriend Dave.  I get invited to his home once or twice.  He's a ridiculous clown, though congenial, and his wife is pretty bright.  I seduced her a few weeks later.  While he's passed out in the bedroom I had her bent over a chair.  She became a fairly regular and to this day, a decade past his divorce Dave still doesn't know.  He was fired from the convenience store for frequent theft.  

Fast forward 14 years and I have several more of these events under my belt.  I encountered and befriended weak men who gave me all the clues of a horny and available wife and took full advantage with incredible ease.  They weren't just easy, they were low-hanging-fruit.  Each man turned out to be dishonest and self-serving.  Skipping the details because you get the picture.

Right now rent in the East Bay is ungodly so to save dough I rent a room.  Last week I interviewed for a nice room in a large home with a younger couple in their mid 30s and a few kids.  She's the talker.  She directs the interaction.  He's just.. There.  I tried to engage him in discussion but he lacked presence, misunderstanding the simplest questions and having a generally dead and vapid demeanor.  He smirked constantly.  He was short and pale and turned out to be a simple laborer and hardly proud to announce it.  His handshake was pathetic. 

 His wife is a slim Asian 6 who could not lay off of the hardly subtle IOIs while he sits there, grinning to himself about whatever might go on in the mind of a beta maggot, totally unaware.  I detested his weakness and the wild animal in me wanted to non-figuratively eat him.  When my friend later asked about the potential roommates I said without much thought ""He's a pussy and she needs to get fucked.""  Instincts again. 

I got and accepted for the room.  OK we know by now that this was a stupid idea.  There were great flowing red flags everywhere and like a bull I charged at them... Hey it's a good place and the ""amenities"" look fine. 

I had her on her back on my Ikea twin memory foam mattress on the 3rd night. I made no effort other than to offer to show her my fishbowl.  

Since I am in fact literally Hitler now you may be happy to hear I got my just punishment.  It's the 5th night and I was just asked to move out at the end of the month.  ""We're just not sure it's going to work out.""  I guess my leaving at 6 AM and coming home at 9pm and going to bed is really tough on them.  Or maybe it's something else making the happy couple uncomfortable.  

Bonus: the inherent dishonesty of the natural beta.

When he laid the news on me he chose to do it on the phone.  I wanted to needle him a little, toy with the situation.  Maybe even manipulate a better situation.  I quickly gave up on the latter idea and proceeded out of sheer amusement with discussion.  

""Why, what's wrong.""  

""We're just not comfortable with you.""  

""You brought me in under the pretense of long-term month to month.""  

*arrogantly*- ""That's not on paper."" 

""I think you should at least have the courage to give me a solid reason."" 

*smarmily* ""Maybe it's the way you're talking to me now.""

Pause.  What a fucking worm.  

""Ok then, well that's that. I'll get out ASAP.""  

""No you can have 2 months.""  

""No thanks, I'll take the pro-rate instead.""  Got him to sign an agreement to pro-rate just in case.  Sleazy cunt. 

You'd think I'd be ashamed but I find it hard to see weak men as people.  I'm still compassionate, I AM compassionate.  I feel for these sorry saps.  But this is the way of the world.  If a predator eats you it's because you suck at dodging and you deserve it.

TL;DR
A married beta has a cheating wife.  Fuck her.  He deserves it.

TL;DR
A beta hates himself and can't be expected to be honest.",903,0,0.3506999909877777,"girl, feel, really, find, still, shit, male, always, leave, relationship",1

**Self-Introduction**

&nbsp;

Hello, I am an Asian American, male, age 23, 5'6, 160lb.  It's been several years since I have started this journey. Typical bluepill background. Typical Asian upbringing. School smart but not street smart. High school was a dud and I wanted to committed suicide during my junior year. Been told I was cute before but never had the balls to do anything. Been an orbiter, emotional tampon, ""best friend"", the whole nine yards. 

&nbsp;

My journey started in 2013 when I discovered PUA, then to TRP, then to MGTOW, and now I'm just a guy with a mission in life with bit of knowledge and better boundaries. Went through all the stages of grief and learn to accept women and their.. special ways. They aren't meant to be men so I can't expect them to have the same values as men. Now life tends to be more.. amusing and less.. self inflicting drama. I am way less thirsty around women and no longer asking 'why' about a lot of things. Instead I now know 'why' and tend just shrug things off when they don't work out.  

&nbsp;

Below is a list of ideals I have come across on this journey, things I have struggle with, and the tools that had help me along the way. I ask you to keep an open mind and take everything with a grain of salt. Do you own research and conduct your own experiments and observations. 

&nbsp;

Note: All listed books can be purchased on the Amazon Kindle App. Save trees, save space, and read anytime, anywhere. Use Audio Narrations upgrades for times like traveling, cleaning, or working out.

For curious newbies:

* *Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance. And because it is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn't fit in with the core belief. -Frantz Fanon*

**The First Rule of TRP is: You Do Not Talk About TRP. The Second Rule of TRP is: You Do Not Talk About TRP.**

&nbsp;

WARNING: TRP is not a safe subject. *Cue eye-rolls.* The truth is hard to hear and much harder to accept. It is never popular but always a necessity. There are those who would use TRP philosophy incorrectly just like those who use religions or politics to suppress or terrorized others. Keep your mouth shut and your thoughts to yourself whenever these type of topics come up in public. Self-preservation keeps you safe and others safe. Let people think how they want to think.

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Do not talk how 'alpha' you are or how 'beta' someone is in public. It's sad and pathetic. You wouldn't be here if you were a natural alpha. We all were betas. Be humble.*
 * *Do not put down or insult women for not sleeping with you. They are not evil, prudes, bitches, cunts, sluts, whores, or etc because they won't help you get your dick wet. They are human too. They have the freedom of choice and numerous of men to choose from. It is just a different world for women.*
 * *TRP is a brotherhood. For those of you who want to help our brothers who are plugged in, please keep in mind of how much you resisted swallowing the pill. Just keep an ear out when they start dropping hints. They will be ready when they will be ready. Do not force it. You can only lead a horse to water, you can't make it drink it.*

&nbsp;

**A Different Perspective than the Standard Disney Dream:**

&nbsp;

Welcome to TRP. Somehow you arrived here because your method of attracting women isn’t working and you are looking for different answers. It is consider madness if you repeat the same action over and over and expect a different result. It is NOT wrong of you wanting to get better at attracting women just as it is NOT wrong of women wanting to be more attractive to men. 

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Use the Five Stages of Grief to identify your emotions and state of mind. It WILL be hard and does take a lot time to come to an acceptance of TRP perspective. It is completely normal to feel negative feelings such as anger, hate, depression, feeling lied to, exploited, ignorant, etc. What you are feeling is the change. You will breakdown. You must breakdown. Then you will rebuild yourself. We men are taught to not express our troubles or negative emotions in public view due to all sorts of backlash if we do. TRP is a safe and anonymous place where you rant your hatred, your negativity, your mistakes, and your grief in the privacy of your own home and your own mind. This is where we can get honest answers, feedback, and guidance from those who were in the similar situations. Be patience, be kind, and be grateful once you are unplugged.*

**Traditional Male Roles in Modern Times?**

&nbsp;

Be on guard with your traditional male role. There are plenty of people willing to take advantage of it. Men roles and women roles are being questioned and everybody is confused. Mother nature will always be the invisible government of the land. However, mankind's 'laws' are always changing, for better or worse. Men, please do some research for your legal rights (or lack of in some areas). Remember, women have the potential to use men as successful objects just as men have the potential to exploit women as sex objects.

&nbsp;

Cross-examine your behaviors by heading over to the ‘niceguys’ subreddit to see examples. Learn the difference between infatuation and love. There is also a 'nicegirls' subreddit too.

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Don't ever give favors or gifts for women and expect sex in return. You WILL become passive aggressive when you are disappointed. Women are not stupid. They can smell a guy's agenda or ulterior motives a mile away. Always be upfront with what you want and always be willing to leave or show anyone the door when it doesn't work out.*

**Relationships & the Human's Need to Love**

&nbsp;

Educate yourself about relationships. A lot of relationships fail because one or both parties are not educated about the other sex and/or their own needs and boundaries. Ask yourself honestly and deeply why you want to be in a relationship. You should NEVER depend on one person to fulfill your EVERY single need. Don't put all your eggs in one basket for love, emotional support, loyalty, and etc. Diversify your love between all of your family, friends, coworkers, mentors, etc. Learning to not 'own' another person and be whole and happy on your own is having an abundance mentality. She is NOT yours, it is just your turn.

**Frame Control & Personal Boundaries**

&nbsp;

This is a way to control your reptilian brain or 'reactive' side. Reacting is instinctual.  Responding is a conscious choice.  When something happens, our body is going to react automatically regardless.  The trick is to become aware of this initial reaction, resist doing anything, involve your higher intelligence by considering options, possible ramifications, who you want to be, and what is going to be in your best interest, and, then, choose how to respond. 

* *Man is affected, not by events, but by his view he takes of them. -Epictetus*

* *Recommend Method:*
 * *Stoicism is a great philosophy to adapt.*
 * *You are the CEO of YOUR life. Learn to make decisions for yourself and lead. You are the captain. Let the other person(s) decide if they want to follow. You choose who stays and who goes. Anyone toxic, can include family and friends, need to be let go. All relationships are give and take. Keeping scores in your head is fine but don't get obsess with it. You are the average of the five people you spent your most time with. Crabs in a barrel mentality is an easy red flag.*
 * *Practice saying 'no' out loud with confident and conviction. Learn to say 'sorry' less and only when it is absolutely necessary. Take your time talking. Don't rush things and don't let anyone rush you. Be content during those silent pauses. Gather your thoughts Pick your battles wisely. You can never change a person's world view overnight. Walk away if needed.*
 * *Stay amused. Have a play and/or flirty tone when teasing. It's banter and it's supposed to be fun. Test yourself 'being mean' cautiously. Don't backpetal whenever possible. Never get into a fight with or over a women. You automatically lost frame.*
  * *Imagery training. I have a rather good imagination and tend to play devil advocate with myself. I ""test"" myself against scenarios with my ideal oneities, bitches, AMOG, betas, white knights, femnazi, and etc. You can do it anytime but you must envision REALISTIC solutions. It teaches you where your state of mind is and how much control you have over your emotions and reactions.*

**Sexy Times in Bed**

&nbsp;

Wanting sex is NORMAL for humans. Repeat: Wanting sex is NORMAL for humans. It is a built-in nature for all lifeforms to have sex and reproduce. Just learn to control your biological sexual urges so it doesn't control you. STOP being so thirsty. Sex is great and all but it's not the one thing in this world you should strive for. Your value as a man is not defined by the quantity or quality of women you can bring to bed. Ask yourself honestly and deeply why you want sex. 

* *Destroy the sex glands, whether in man or beast, and you have removed the major source of action. For proof of this, observe what happens to any animal after it has been castrated. A bull becomes as docile as a cow after it has been altered sexually. Sex alteration takes out of the male, whether man or beast, all the FIGHT that was in him -Napoleon Hill*

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Quit using porn and fapping. Practice semen retention. The urge of sex is one of and the MOST POWERFUL driving force of man. You are wasting your drive for fake pixels. (by far one of the hardest thing for me to achieve.)*
 * *Use a condom and wash it out after. Sperm-jackers are real.*
 * *Don't EVER have sex with a drunk girl. You are just asking for a rape accusation.*
 * *For proof of consent: Take selfies throughout the night and save a screenshot of a ""Awesome night"" text and her reply after a night of sex and upload it to the cloud like Google Drive. Invest in a dash cam or home security cameras.*
 * *Don't EVER 'date' coworkers/clients. You are risking your income/job. Don't shit where you eat.*
 * *I used to suffer from premature ejaculation. To last longer, I started doing Kegal exercises and invest in a Fleshlight. Tips I have learned is to use a stopwatch to keep track of time (try to go for 30 mins) and a playlist of sexy songs (YouTube: THE BEDROOM PLAYLIST PT. II R&B/SOUL) to get a sense of a slow thrust rhythm, breathing pace down, mix up body positions, and fingering and licking simultaneously.*

**A Man's Mission In Life & Being Selfish** 

&nbsp;

The most important of concept of TRP is converting your belief from making 'women' being the center of your universe to make 'yourself' the center of your universe. A man's mission should be his MAIN source of happiness. To self-improve is to self-invest which requires you to have self-discipline, learn to love yourself, and put your needs first. An easy concept for self-love is to love and treat yourself like you would love the women of your dreams. Being selfish and putting yourself first is hard for most men to grasp. It is because we have been taught all of our life to self-sacrifice for the greater good of others. Follow your efforts, not your passion. You learn the skills you need in life by searching for it.

**No More BluePill Music**

&nbsp;

Take some time to go through your music collection. Many studies have shown that the type of music or songs that you listen to can have an affect your subconscious or belief/value system. I love music but I get so irritated now with songs that have lyrics like 'waiting for a girl' or 'she is the perfect one', or 'how can I live without her.' Makes me want to gagged and/or cringe.*

**Give Me Masculinity or Give Me Death.**

&nbsp;

Every man should be proud to be a MAN. Society today has drastically demonized the word masculinity. Take pride in yourself and in your manhood. Say to yourself ""I am proud to be a man"". 

&nbsp;

* *Recommend Methods:*
  * *Find some men space. Look, every man need some guy time, away from the women. You need some good brothers to be by your side and can relate to. Take up martial arts, join local sport team, bowling league, golf, pool billard, poker night, sports bar, shooting range, hold a guys night, etc.*
 * *The Art of Manliness. This website gives you a wide variety of little hobbies, manners, and skills that are consider manly. A lot of us didn't have a male role model to teach us these things like how to tie a tie, change a tire, smoke a cigar, etc. This gives you more things to develop your own definition of being a man and personality.*

**Men's Fashion & Style**

&nbsp;

Learn the basics of men's fashion & style and apply it to your wardrobe. It's like a video game, increase attractiveness +5. Once you have the basic down, get rid of all unnecessary clothes so you can look stylish all the time. Understand that generally ""men"" don't care what men wear but ""women"" do because a woman's SMV is mostly based on her looks. Women invested and max out their looks to gain the attention of high-value men. They compare themselves to other women and thus how their man look too. Remember, your clothes convey non-verbally who you are. If you want to be the guy that girls want to fuck, you got to at least look like the part.

**Iron Doesn't Lie**

&nbsp;

Getting in shape. If there was ever a first step to attracting women, this is it. Starting now is the best time to do it. I was a skinny 130lb in high school. Now I'm 160lb and been call ""bigger"" and ""muscular"" which is a confident booster.

**Talking And Body Language**

&nbsp;

Improve your speech/voice and recognize facial/body language. The percentage of types of human communication are consist of: 55% are body movements and facial expression, 38% are voice tone, volume, and pauses, and 7% are words. This is to help you see the subtle signals of attraction or the need to back off.  

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Watch your favorite shows/movies on silent. Look at the actor's facial expression and body movements.*
 * *Stand tall by using the pencil posture test and fix your forward neck or round shoulders by using the 'hang by your teeth' technique.*
 * *Use a computer stand to level your screen higher for a better sitting posture.*
 * *Place a pen in your mouth and start reading out loud. You should be able to pronounce every syllables, talk slower, take breaths and pauses, and get rid of 'umms' and 'uhh'.*
 * *Record yourself reading out loud. To focus on your tone and volume, place your recording device at different distances away from you. This should give you the idea of how loud and clearly you must be speak in order for the person to hear you. You should also listen to pitch of your voice and make sure it stay low.*
 * *Practicing maintaining eye contact by looking in the mirror.*
 * *Learn to sing. For some reason, singing tend to bring people together. When you and another person know the lyrics to a song, it's really cool feeling. Great for singing during car rides and karaoke nights. Take a few singing lessons from a tutor to learn breathing and pitch.* 
 * *Learn how to storytell. Our stories are who we are. Share the jokes, the 'what the fuck' events, the scary adventures and your brainfart moments. You have to 'describe' more than necessary to have her 'live' in the moment.*

**Texting 101**

&nbsp;

Try to keep texting, emails, and any online messenger for logistics. It is a very inefficient tool to use for flirting.

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Text with the PURPOSE of meeting up/making plans. Don't text just for the sake of texting. (Like asking how was her day was or what your goals in life are.) Save that for when you are together in person.*
 * *No wall text, no double texting, and write out your texts in compete words, sentences, and correct grammar.* 
 * *Use 'statements' formats more often than 'questions' format. (Example: Instead of asking her if she is free, tell her a time, location, and activity of what you will be doing together. Take the lead and assume attraction.)*
 * *Do not drunk text or send nudes. (She got enough dick pics from other guys)*
 * *Make a phone call every once in awhile. Show that you got some balls.*
 * *Easy 'nexting' tells: If she responds back to reschedule, she is into you. However, if she 'stalls' without rescheduling, she is not into you. 2-3 strikes and she's out.*

**The Art of Seduction**

&nbsp;

Learning seduction or just basic female interaction. THIS is only when you are at a healthy mindset, have good habits formed, and basically got your shit together. PUA without TRP is basically bluepill mindset but redpill acting.

* *Recommend Methods:*
 * *Make sure your logistics are in order before going anywhere, anytime. You will never know when the next opportunity will arise. Transportation? Check. Bedroom clean? Check. Condoms? Check.*
 * *You must LEAD at all times. IT IS YOUR responsibility to make the FIRST move and every move after that.*
 * *3 second rule: When you see an attractive women, don't think, approach. This gives your brain no time to develop any excuses. Don't restrain yourself to just weekends or night venues. Women are everywhere.*
 * *ACCEPT REJECTIONS GRACEFULLY. You CAN'T attract/have sex with every attractive woman you see. There are too many factors to why a woman rejects you. Just say 'thank you for your time' and move on.*
 * *For first few outing keep it: fun, casual, interactive, cheap/free, kino friendly, and low pressure. Never start off with a dinner or movie. Get ice cream cones, bowling, arcade, laser tag, a walk around a park, putt putt golf, hiking, swimming at beach/pool, board games, and etc.*
 * *Topics to avoid: religion and politics.*
 * *Topics to use: music, movies/tv shows, food you love/hate, adventures, places you have been, happy childhood memories, scary stories, jokes, people watching, the surrounding environment, etc.*
 * *Don't be afraid to touch her! Sit next to her, hold her hand, high fives, hugs, fist bumps, make her twirl, hand slapping game, and etc.*
 * *Kino map: Shoulder -> upper arm -> wrist -> hands.*  
 * *When going for the kiss, make sure to isolate her from the public view or from people she knows. A person's public reputation can greatly differs from their private desires.* 
 * *Keep a little fun sexual tension alive. Use sexual innuendos. Wink, slowly bite lower half of lips, slowly lick top half of lips, smirk, grab/slap her ass playfully, and etc.*
 * *Push and Pull during the interaction. You're not sprinting to the finish line. Escalate and rest on your terms. Give her room to chase. Think it like baking a cake.*

**Final Words:**

&nbsp;

Don't take life too seriously. We live in a very fucked up world. Somewhere, someone else has it worse than you. You were at the bottom but now know the way up. Work hard but do enjoy the little moments and achievements. Laugh at your mistakes and look at how far you had come. Don't compare your life to others or how perfect it 'should' to be. Success in life is when you can smile and say 'yeah, that was fun'.

A way of life wherein I'm constantly told by worthless CUNTS how _I'm_ the one who is inferior, yet I am the one along with all men inventing, building, maintaining and repairing all of the modern, 1st world society men like me provide? To live in a Police State with no rights to my children, no reproductive rights, and as a father, I have less rights than a murderer in a court of law?

Some info before I start:

I recently joined the pus.
I live on base.

I went to the gym on base earlier today and saw someone I hadn't seen in about 7 months. Suddenly I remembered something I thought was worth sharing:

7 months ago I graduated from the recruiting school and was officially a member of the military in my country (not the US if you're wondering). As part of the recruitment process we were assigned new living quarters and a new timetable, after many boring briefs, our last brief of the day was about our new PT (physical training) program.

We were sitting in a briefing cinema filled with 100 new sailors. Around 70 were men and about 30 women. Now, they all weren't HB10's, but most at least had slim, tight bodies due to the unrelenting physical training and controlled diet we had during our recruitment training, to say it plainly, they were all pretty bangable.

Suddenly I noticed the atmosphere changed in the room; people perked up and the loud chattering dulled to soft whispers, someone had walked in....

It was our physical trainer hosting the brief.

He was about 6'8"", had a chiseled jaw, golden hair and blue eyes, was jacked as fuck, golden tan, pearly whites, and had a tattoo sleeve. Now, I'm no closet homo, but I know an attractive man when I see one. This guy was pretty much a model thrown in military uniform.

Every women in the room audibly sighed. Every. Single. One.

To put it simply:

The brief was a train wreck. The poor guy just wanted to explain the timetable and be on his way, but was forced to  face a room of raised, thin-wristed hands - only leading to unrelated, and unrelenting sexual advances thinly-veiled as questions. You could have cut the sexual tension in the air with a butter knife.

I felt bad for a few of the guys in the room. During our 3 months of recruit training, some male and female members grew quite close and formed relationships. Some of those female members were already married, some to civilians some to *other military members*. 

My point being: There were few single women in that room, yet you could hear every vagina collectively gushing like it was niagra falls.

Female hypergamy is very, very real.

These women didn't care about their boyfriend's/husbands *even though some of them were in the room with them.*

They didn't care about being the pursuer, or looking like a whore, *which women usually care very much about,* because **every** other woman was practically jumping this guy's loins. 

For her, this is her chance to obtain the seed of a man in the top 1%, and every other woman in the room is fighting for it as well. Being labelled a whore is the least of her worries. 

This, gentleman, is an example of how fast things can change for you. Even if your LTR loves you more than she thought possible, all it takes is a more attractive man with better genes than you to waltz along, and given the opportunity, she will jump ship faster than you can say: ""but why?!""

This is why marriage isn't advised in this sub. Honour does not exist for women. Their biological imperative trumps all. Logic. Rules. Laws. But it is not their fault, it is just how they are. It is a hard pill to swallow, but you must understand that you cannot love and trust woman like men do in hollywood movies.

Remember: You must always be prepared for the scenario where she cheats on you with a better man. It may never happrn to you, but even if you've done everything right, things can change in an instant. It isn't anyone's fault. Hard next and move on.",887,4,0.38940000534057617,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first",1
553gwd,69,553gwd,2016-09-30T01:55:47Z,comms_num,159,top,1,TheRedPill,1046,"In club/bar environments it's often thought the most difficult approach of all is directly approaching a group of uber hot women and successful endgame of taking one  home. This post demonstrates a number of methods to give these  girls the good seeing too they all crave and make everyone happy in the process.
The methods outlined can be deconstructed and used in isolation in various other situations, but in this case they're usually all needed due to our quarry being in a group and all hot. Social engineering  methods will run alongside psychological ones for maximum impact.
 The group should be of a minimum of four women and a maximum of ten, and preferably receiving a lot of passive attention from other males.
 
Please note: This is a meta strategy to achieve an end goal. If at any point your target shows genuine interest you can skip steps, as you're already where you want to be (but watch for compliance tests).

**Step 1: Identifying Your Targets**
The first step is deciding which  girls you're going to use as your gateway strategy. I say, ""girls"" because as well as selecting a target (your end game girl) you will also need to identify one of the other girls as a leverage  point for the social dynamic aspect of the method.

[ In this case it doesn't have to be mother hen as the status of the girls in the group is  pretty similar so there's little difference in *""ranking""* due to them all being 9's or 10's.]

 The girl to use as leverage will be the girl most interested in being approached and thus most likely ascribed by the other girls unconsciously as their biggest sexual  rival. To identify her, study the group carefully. Your selection will  seem less interested in the inane female chit chat taking place and will tend to scan the environment, looking around to check who is in the venue (which Chads) more so than the other girls.

 She's looking to see which guys are there as it's her intention to get laid that night. She will most likely be wearing the most revealing outfit in the group and peaking in her ovulation cycle. Possibly wearing something red or maybe just red lipstick or nails as women seem to have a predilection for the colour -combined with skimpy outfits- when they're at their most fertile, and thus at their horniest.

[Not wearing red isn't a deal breaker, but if you're 50/50 over two girls in the group, then use the red wearing one as your default selection. A number of scientific studies have correlated the colour to women at their most fertile/horny. As the saying goes *""Red shoes, no knickers""*.
 
 Women are always checking out other girls in public venues to monitor their status in the ongoing attraction hierarchy - but if you watch - you will see that girls with red clothing or nails/lipstick receive particular attention when they're first spotted. The other girls know full well the significance of what's going on, even if it's just on an unconscious level.

 The other girls in the group will know this too unconsciously and attempt to engineer spoiling strategies to counter their rival. You may notice they will look at her more to check what's she's up to and rubberneck during conversations they're having with the others to keep tabs on her: Watch for this.

 The final sign is a body language indicator much beloved by used car salesmen and one (now that you've read this) you're going to see, all the time and even notice yourself doing it to the point you say ""WTF!"" when you see the hidden matrix of attraction cues going on around you.


 Have you ever seen two people who know each other, meet and stop in the street for a chit chat, but one needs to get away because they're busy? Have you noticed what happens to the angle of one of their feet? It POINTS towards the direction they want to go: the direction they were originally heading, it's unconscious body language leakage indicating an ongoing desire that's found even in higher primates.

 Good car salesmen know this too, when they're chatting to a prospect on the lot they're keeping a close eye on where your foot is pointing as THAT'S the car you like. Your foot points towards things you like, and away from things you don't. We all do it, I do it, you do it and hot bitches in bars do it.

 Of all  the body language clues  the most accurate (and only ones which can be used in isolation) are eye contact and foot pointing. When you're stood in a bar or chatting to your buddies, the default position for you feet are the 5 minutes to 1 position. Look for girls who have a foot deviating from this stance unless there's a good reason, then look to see where it's pointing.

[In fact; next time you're in a bar or club with your buddies, look towards where one of your **own** feet are pointing. If one of them is pointed away from its default position then it's very likely pointing towards some hottie you have your eye on]

**In Summary**: The girl you are going  to use as leverage to assist your entry will be exhibiting what's known as an *""R cluster""*.


* Reconnaissance: She's scanning the bar looking for which guys (Chads) are in the venue as potential partners.
* Revealing: She will most likely be the most sexily dressed of the group.
* Red: She will most likely be wearing the colour red.
* Real Interest: One of her feet will be pointing away from the group and towards where her real interest lays, usually a man or group of men.


[Disclaimer: allow for pointing which may be towards the bar (she wants a drink), the toilets (she needs to pee), the dancefloor (she wants to dance) or the exit (she wants to leave) although you will only see these indicators when she's in conversation with someone  else. If she's not engaged in something she'll just act on what she wants without pointing ]

 Under any other circumstances this is the girl whom you should target in an approach strategy; whether it be a mother hen gateway -then move to your interest- or a direct approach to your interest from off the bat. Either way this is the girl most DTF that night.

 In this case however, with the group all being uber hotties this is the girl you will use as your leverage  point for entry  - without activating any alarm bells or bitch shields [sure you can game this girl after, once you're established yourself ] but the purpose of this strategy is gaining access first, disqualifying yourself from your approach girl (albeit temporarily) and then use your game skills to move things on.

 Your actual target girl is the next one down on the *""R cluster""* scale. She will be exhibiting some or all of the *""R cluster""* traits (though not to the extent of your leverage girl) but also target girl will be rubber necking your leverage  girl as her prime sexual rival that night. Women pick up on other girls who are ovulating on an unconscious level and adjust their behaviours sub consciously by mate guarding their partner more if they have one, and cockblocking their female friends if they're both single. You're going to use this unconscious behavioural drive for your own ends.


**Step 2: The approach.**
In this situation you have two types of frame.
 1/ The extant frame: Group of super hotties too good for anyone in the bar and *""girl power""* blowing off men and acting like a pack of bitches.

 2/ The intrinsic frame: The real frame, a group of sexual rivals jockeying for status, utilising devious feminine psychological methods on each other, but pretending to be best girly friends while they do it.

 The problem is:  An extant frame can be pretty solid due to what's known as embodied cognition and the girls actually start acting as if this **is** the reality they're in,  they start feeding their emotional states off each other in a feedback loop known as *""Limbic  resonance""* and post hoc rationalising their own behaviour (known as *""Hamstering""*....) to avoid cognitive dissonance.

 In broscience this is called *""Believing your own shit""*.
A radical deframe is required. Gentlemen, such a deframing  exists.

**""The Queens Of Sheba Opener.""**

 Internalise your RP mindset as the **selector** and approach your target girl direct (ensure she has a full drink as you don't want any distractions or default ""drink tooling"" programs firing up). Make sure she sees you are approaching so you don't trigger an auto pilot response by surprising her, then stop in front of her as if weighing her up for a few seconds, then ask the question.

*""Who's your friend?""*

 She'll be expecting a chat up line or random beta validation, but gets surprise instead (the type we DO need)  which derails normal shit testing programming (we're also generating an emotional response here, which is good) but curiosity will make her ask...

*""Which one?""* [ that's why we need a minimum of 4 girls in the group ].

 With a nod of your  head towards your leverage girl reply...

*""The one all the guys are interested in""*

 This is a **huge** deframe. There she is enjoying all this attention and validation, then all of a sudden the rug is pulled from under her: The attention and validation may not actually be for her!

 Hamster central rapidly boots up to protect her self-image.

*""The guys are looking at all of us....?""*

*""Is nobody actually interested in me and it's actually my friend that's creating all this interest from guys...?""*

*""I'm beautiful, but is she so much more attractive than me that all these guys don't care?""*

*""Am I the least attractive of my friends...?""*

*""What the fuck is my status in the group...?""*

All these thoughts go through her head in a split second as you've just triggered an *""imposter syndrome""* program to run in her mind. Not only that, but the source of it is her prime sexual rival who she unconsciously ascribes as a threat.

Oh fucking dear...

 Her status is now in limbo and  needs a reference point to stabilise itself so her limbic brain creates a sense of dread  causing her to reframe from the bottom up to achieve some stability to build from. The dread is hard-wired into her brain: In the ancestral environment a rapid change in circumstances could mean imminent danger or a big survival opportunity. The limbic brain doesn't trust your pre-frontal cortex (the conscious) to deal with it so pulls rank and drops into *heuristic* mode.
 
Heuristics are nothing more than pre-wired emotional responses on how to deal with something quickly. They come from the emotional brain and are combinations of responses based on previous similar experiences (the social emotions like, shame, guilt, jealousy etc) with some actually hard-wired into the brain's source code (like fear, anger, lust etc ). When these heuristics are running then you're also susceptible to influence, as you're locking onto someone else's frame as a scaffolding to bring you back to normality/stasis and the ""emotional traffic highway"" is now open for emotions coming in the opposite direction (from the other person).

 Your frame as selector and alpha is incorporated into her own.

[ To the vast majority of girls *""status""* within their peer group (which used to be the tribe) is of considerable importance as it had to be kept a close eye on in the ancestral environment to maximise the potential of mating with the highest alpha male they could get. It had to be monitored at all times and like I said action taken to avoid any potential loss and seize on the opportunity for any potential improvement.]
 
With very hot girls status is even more important  as being *""top girl""* was the genetic jackpot for their genes. These girls now pretty much have everything, the looks, the orbiters, the protectors, and all the other benefits which come from being an uber hottie. The one thing they have to work for is their status/value with other uber hotties in their group/tribe.

 Lost at sea she now starts to do something she very rarely does: She starts qualifying herself to you and sabotaging her rival.


**Step 3: The Lock In**

**Important** If you start validating her now, then any potential attraction will disappear very quickly. Remember this as you will have an urge to do so.

 The behaviour you drop into now is that of *""amused mastery""* with a heavy emphasis of skepticism. Cross your arms when she's validating herself, but listen to the criteria she's basing herself judged worth upon. See if you can find an adjective she seems keen on which you can use to preface the word *""Confident""*. When you've identified the word then make sure to slightly nod when you hear it (more about this later, but it's to do with what are called *""trancewords""*.) The nod is a way of analogically marking it through body language so that its significance is processed unconsciously, as body language is decoded by the unconscious brain first and the conscious secondly, but only if it appears to be incongruous will the conscious boot up to give it ""due process"".

Keep a wry amused smile on your face, she will sense that you're not taking the bait and most likely go some light kino on you to punctuate her emotional state and expect you to invest with some validation. Kino  her back, but always in a pushing fashion and don't look where you touch (it's creepy). Because of her emotional state your kino won't be processed at a conscious level as the cognitive buffer is filled with other concerns, but unconsciously it's getting through to her attraction centres.


**Step 4 The Lock Down**
 The key now is to drop her out of her emotional state temporarily and then spike it back up again using a process known as *""refractionation""*. Basically when someone comes out and then back into the same emotional state, the second time they go into it, it's more powerful. It's a method used by the *""speed seduction""* community to generate high levels of arousal in a woman, but in this case we're just using it for a different emotional model to suit our strategy.

 Uncross your arms with a sigh, relax and then change the subject to something mundane going on in the venue as if you're just chatting to one of your buddies. Men do not do this to uber hotties as their usual remit is to try to impress them. She will think you've disqualified her (causing slight confusion) as a potential partner and up your ascribed value in her mind. Carry on the conversation for about a minute and then drop the line.
*""Actually you have three big advantages over your friend""* (leverage girl).

[Credit for this goes once again to Mystery and was originally known as the *""Three Things About You Technique""*. Its methodology was to tell a girl two things about herself attraction wise that she didn't know, but not the third. The PUA could then either go sarge other girls or go to the washroom or bar knowing he had inoculated the girl from further approaches by other guys hanging around as she always wanted to find out the third.]

 It uses a cognitive bias we all have known as the *""Zeigernic effect""* and is very effective [I can vouch for its impact as I've had girls come to a bar they knew I was going next, wait outside a wash room for me, and even been pulled out of a taxi to find out the elusive third thing.]
 
**The Three Things**: This time, however we're going to use the *""things""* as vehicles for some pretty devious and cunning psychological deep mind influence.

 When she asks what they are, use the ones below and make sure to preface the first with the words *""The first one is""*. This is to create a language pattern known as an *""Ordinal"".

 An *""Ordinal""* is a presupposition that there will be a number of things. By using the word ""first"" you're implying that there will be a second, third, etc. The second, third may not even exist, but the listener presupposes that they do as you used the word ""first"".

[ The woman already knows there will be three things, but in this case you're using it a reinforcer to prevent cognitive drift ]

 Then use the word ""Because"". ""Because"" is a statement as opposed to a question and various studies have discovered the word as a preface generates more influence from the speaker. This is because the laws of cause and effect are programmed into all higher animal brains, but by using the word at the beginning of our list (use it only for the first thing) and going through the list in this order, we are starting a process called *""State Titration"" so each separate ""thing"" titrates into the next one, making the process seamless and generating *""cognitive fluency"" to prevent her critical factor booting up.

 [Count them off on your fingers as you do so. In this way you're again using a body language cue to anchor them.]

1/ "" The first thing is because...."" Then a comment on her appearance, but **not** anything physical. It's important that it's something which you genuinely like as the very fact that you have spotted it means it will be something which she wore for that purpose. Something like her dress or shoes making her look *""classy""* or *""sophisticated""* as if these are essential criteria for you in a partner (if you DO have essential criteria then use those instead as it will help your congruence).
 
She will see this as an advantage she has over her fellow beauty leverage girl and mentally agree.

 You have just started what's known as a *""Yes Set""* (getting her mind into the house of yes) to ease the next two things through.

2/ A comment on how she's a friendly girl and not standoffish. The reason for this is you're *""priming""* the *""friendly""* behaviour mindset (by ""half cocking"" the relevant network of neurons"" ) into her brain, so she will more likely to act friendly and  less keen to start shit testing you. Because you've already got her brain into yes mode (the essence of the *""yes set""*) from your first statement and you're titrating emotional state, her critical factor  (the pre-frontal cortex) usually lets the idea into her mind without much introspection. ( No need to use ""because"" or ""The .......thing is"", from now on as their work is done ).

3/ Now we use the most Machiavellian attraction trigger in existence...

 The Amygdala Feedback Loop.

 But first some background. You may have noticed I'm a big proponent of *""embodied cognition""*. This is for good reason. It's commonly reasoned that when the mind wants the body to do something, it sends a signal to cause the result it requires. This is true, but only half the story. When the body commits the action the mind requests, it sends a signal back to the brain to announce its new state. The brain analyses the return signal and tweaks its instructions in a feedback loop to fine-tune everything and achieve maximum efficiency.

 However...if you consciously induce that state in yourself or someone else then the unconscious picks up the return signal and assumes that the signal is the current *""state of play""* of how things are, and sychronises itself to it, feeding back the new mental model to the body in an ever strengthening loop until the new state becomes the new reality.

 There's been a lot of research into this and the original model was proven by researchers who asked test volunteers to read jokes with and without a pencil held in their mouth. They discovered that the volunteers found the jokes funnier with the pencils then without them.

Why?

Holding the pencil in the mouth requires the face to use the *""Zygomatic major muscle""* to do so. This muscle is also the one which unconsciously triggers when we smile. The brain senses that the muscle is triggering and infers that activity is happening in the body which correlates to a happy/funny state. Instead of the feedback loop going *""brain to body to brain to body....""* it begins at the state of the *""body""* instead. The mind adopts the state of the body (happy) to avoid dissonance and the new state becomes the norm, but in this case...
 You find the jokes funnier.

 So...we trigger a behaviour in the girl which correlates to her being attracted to someone.

**WARNING**

 Sometimes however, this feedback loop runs out of control and can actually cause a panic attack. Calibrate her state closely at this time as any other emotions ongoing in her psyche can hitch a ride on the loop, and some girls can go really crazy when this happens. We're running a pure attraction loop and nothing else here so be careful what you're doing.

 We count off our third finger, look her in the eye, pause, and then say......

*""The third thing is you make lots of very confident eye contact""*.

Why? Because very attractive girls are very adept at avoiding eye contact with random guys who constantly try to make it with them. If they didn't, then they would have no end of loser types she has no interest in approaching her and wasting her time.

 The only guys she **does* make eye contact with, are guys she is interested in or attracted to.
 You've induced a state of attraction in her as she will now adopt that behaviour with you. The body is saying to the brain *""I'm making a great deal of eye contact with this guy""* so her mind says *""Ok that must mean I am attracted to him, so make more of the same""* and the feedback loop continues.

The reasons she adopts the behaviour are.

1/ She's in validation mode with you as her sexual rival is stealing her thunder; she wants it back and if eye contact is an ace up her sleeve, then so be it.

2/ She's in the final stage of a *""yes set"".*

3/ Do you remember the bit about *""trancewords""* earlier? Trancewords are words (usually adjectives) based on a person's sense of values. These  values are an actual part of someones identity at their most powerful. When she's stating her case for being more attractive/desirable than her rival she's using what she considers her main advantages over her.

 They could be: *""I'm more passionate"", ""classy"", ""sophisticated"", ""deep"", ""seductive""* etc.

 So the final push to get this behaviour through to her limbic brain is to utilise a value which has already been ""preapproved"" by her unconscious as being important to her. This is a technique known as *""tailgating""*. You take a value very close to another person's belief model, link it to the value/behaviour you wish to induce and the very association of the latter to the former stamps the signal **approved for access to limbic brain** to the package as a whole. Into her mind it goes to be unwrapped back into its two separate values once it's arrives.
 
Machiavellian? Totally. Manipulative? Absolutely.
 
 So....For the final push... with a slight nod (our earlier state anchor) we say...

*""You make very confident (insert trance word here) eye contact""*.


**Step 5: Welcome To My Frame**

 This stage is the stage to drop her totally out of her frame and into yours. You invite her into your territory. One of the remits of an alpha male in the entire animal kingdom is that they have their own territory. In this case, it would either be where you were originally stood if you're on your own, or back to your wingmen/wingman if you're in a group. By doing so you're demonstrating territorial, attraction generating cues at the very deepest parts of her limbic mind. That's the place (amygdala) where the values ""Fight, Feed, Fuck"" reside.

 This is deep core and the place you want to be.

**Step 6: How The World Is**

 If you're on your own, then project the emotional behaviour and frame that's she's a plate that you're very fond of (mentally not verbally) and run with that, with the odd unpredictable intercession (this refractionates but also loads up her cognitive buffer to keep the unconscious highways clear).

 If you're with your buddies then brief them before the approach on what to do when you bring the girl over. A good first thing for one of them to say is.

*""Are we staying or are we going?""*

 By doing this you indicate to her that you're the leader of your group (the alpha) but also imply a *""scarcity""* mindset in her so she will infer that you may actually be leaving (after all this chemistry!) and make her invest more. 

 You of course reply...

*""I haven't decided yet""*

 The mindset your group should now operate on, is as if she's a girlfriend you've been dating a while, but they've just met her. The group frame that this is the reality in question will permeate unconsciously and eliminate any residual frame she has (people drop into the strongest frame they're interacting with 95% of the time).

 No doubt the buddies will be looking for a piece of the action too, in which case ask her a female opinion on something then get her to invite one of her friends over to back her up. Now her group is splitting, some of your guys can go over and chat to the remaining ones. Top R cluster girl is your best bet here for ease of entry.

 After that is up to you, but the goal you want is to separate and isolate all the girls into groups of two (two girls-two wingmen) then run with it, with the end goal of bouncing in pairs to the next venue, but keep your frame tight at all times.

**End Note**

The most important thing about this method is YOU. In all human interactions, people send out what could be called *""reality pings""* like a submarine's sonar. These *""pings""* detect the frame of an ongoing interaction and who's going to drop into whose frame. The pings happen on an unconscious level and give an emotional valence to the frame at hand. Most people know about body language communication at a meta level, but below that there are tiny nuances in behaviour and physiology called *""BMIRs"". This stands for *Behavioural Manifestations Of Internal Representations""*.

 BMIR's are impossible to consciously fake and also very difficult consciously to detect. They just give us a gut feeling about someone (although the American secret service does train its agents using some BMIRs called ""Facial Action Cues"" [Micro gestures of the face which last only 300 milliseconds] developed by a guy called Paul Ekman so it can be done.

Alas we don't have access to this level of training but there is a fast track method.

 Genuinely believing your TRP frame and knowing 100% that the method will work. When you do that your BMIRs are a 100% reflections of your intentions and mental frame. The woman gets the ""feelz"" about you on an unconscious level. Her ""reality pings"" are mapping your psyche and getting the thumbs up (it's based on the ""limbic resonance"" I covered earlier). Hypnotists utilise the concept by what's called ""going first"". They adopt the emotion they wish their subject to have, the subject picks up the BMIRs of the emotion, their mirror neurons inject it into their own ""global-workspace"" and they feel the emotion themselves.

Remember though: In field is chaos at the best of times with people coming in and out of set and a great deal of distractions (Mobile phones!) but the greater the integrity of your frame (your force field) the less effect these things will have.

**TL;DR** Look up the bit about foot pointing. It's the matrix unveiled of attraction intentions.

Today I want to tell you everything I know about getting the highest calibre girls from cold approach.  
This guide will cover: frame control, inner game, and passing tests — which I consider to be the holy trinity of “9 and 10 game”.  
This guide will NOT cover: body language, pulling, or handling logistics. Obviously, the latter are extremely important, but they’ve been adequately covered elsewhere, and there just isn’t space to include them here.

**My background**  
Picked on in school, small and sickly, didn’t have a girlfriend until 18. Was dumped by her and spent the first 2 years of college pretty much celibate.  
Got into redpill ideas through the old “Citizen Renegade” blog (which is now Heartiste). From there stumbled on RSD’s infield videos.  
Started going out and approaching regularly. Approach anxiety and ceaseless rejection for months, but I kept at it. The odd success here and there.  
After about 2 years I was fucking a new girl every fortnight or so, mostly 7s and 8s with the occasional turbo when fortune smiled on me. My current girlfriend is a 9, has done modelling etc.  


&nbsp;


**Below is everything I know about getting the hottest women from cold approach pickup.**
This is specially engineered for getting 9s and 10s and dealing with the kind of bullshit these girls will inevitably give you.  
If you’re more into sleeping with tons of 7s (and there’s nothing wrong with that), this might be overkill.  
When I was single I personally was one of those guys who would rather fuck half a dozen 9s/10s in a year than 50 mid range girls, so my whole approach to game is based on optimizing for that.  
Take it for what it is — I’m not saying my approach is better, this is just how I roll based on my preferences.  
This is a long post. You may want to bookmark it and return to it later if you’re particularly concerned with getting the hottest girls.   There’s a lot of subtle points in here that won’t be immediately clear on a first reading.  


&nbsp;


---------


&nbsp;


**PART 1: THE ATTRACTION PROCESS**  


&nbsp;


**1\. Women are attracted to you because you have a stronger frame than they do.**  
That’s all.  
There’s nothing else to it.  
Attraction is purely a function of the fact that:  
1\. you’re a man  
2\. you have a *stronger frame* than the girl  
As a man, you naturally have a strong frame of reality whereas women don’t. Therefore they value that. (Having a strong frame is a result of high testosterone levels.)  


&nbsp;


**2\. Women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame than a handsome guy with a weak one**  
Evolution has designed women to be very flexible in terms of who they’ll become attracted to.  
Women would rather fuck an ugly guy with a strong frame (i.e. a natural leader) than a handsome guy with a weak frame (cowardice, uncertainty).  
That’s because women who chose to fuck the latter ultimately had their genes rooted out of existence by the brutal conditions of ancestral life.  
In consequence, women now are very adaptable. They have the capacity to be attracted to almost ANY man so long as his frame is stronger than hers.  


&nbsp;


**3\. A girl can ONLY get horny for you if you have a stronger frame than her.**  
Think of this like a mathematical equation. There’s no getting around it, no cheating it, no short-circuiting it. It is an immutable law.  
Women want to submit to you. They want to submit to a strong man. But she can’t submit to you if your frame is weaker than hers.  
Physiologically, girls can’t even become wet for a guy who has a weaker frame than they do. It’s literally impossible.  


&nbsp;


**4\. “Be a man. Act like you have answers.” (Bill Burr)**  
What is a strong frame? Fundamentally, it’s a sense of certainty in everything you do. This certainty manifests itself as calmness in the face of social pressure.  
Simply put, in a cold approach pickup, the woman becomes attracted to you because you’re more relaxed than she is.  
That’s all.  
That might seem strange, but it’s actually not.  
The very fact that you approached the girl at all demonstrates a massive amount of confidence and social value (either real or potential).  
So once you’ve approached the girl and gotten her into a conversation, the game is yours to lose. She’ll inevitably become attracted to you because you’re a man, and because you have a stronger frame than she does.  


&nbsp;


**5\. Relax**  
You will approach women, and you will make mistakes. That’s fine. Women don’t want you to be perfect. They only want you to be a man.  
You are not physically perfect. Neither am I. Neither is anyone.  
Women are not looking for perfection. They’re only looking for a man who has a *stronger psychological frame* than they do.  
And fortunately for you, you already have a naturally stronger frame than women.  
An example of this is how women will freak out over spiders or mice, jump up and down, scream, and so on, whereas a man will calmly deal with the situation without it breaking his frame.  


&nbsp;


**6\. She tests your frame to test your masculinity. The two are the exact same thing.**  
Women are attracted to *masculinity*. And masculinity can be defined as a measure of how much pressure a man can endure without it breaking his frame.  
When you approach a hot woman, she immediately starts trying to break down your frame.  
She’s testing it for strength.  
If your frame crumbles in the face of her frame, she knows you’re not a man — because men have a stronger frame than women.  
Fortunately, your frame will not crumble. A girl’s frame will always “buckle” under yours after you pass several of her tests. It’s instinctual. Women want to be with the strong man. When she sees you have a strong frame she starts getting wet.  


&nbsp;


**7\. “Listen, smile, nod, agree — then do what the fuck you were gonna do anyway.” (Robert Downey Jr.)**  
Women test me all the time. Women have said things to me that are totally brutal — called me ugly, too short, a loser, etc.  
Most of the women I approach will make a weird face or pretend to ignore me for the first 10-20 seconds.  
It doesn’t penetrate. It doesn’t cause any emotional reaction whatsoever inside me. I smile, nod, agree and then keep talking to her as if she’s being nice to me.  
Eventually, she starts responding. Then she starts laughing. And then we have sex.  
A woman’s frame will ALWAYS buckle under yours. It’s not a question of “if”, but “when”.  


&nbsp;


**8\. Chasing hot girls gives you a “charge”**  
When you’re first getting into game, it’s fine to only approach 5s and 6s.  
Many of these girls will be super nice to you, and that’s cool. A lot of them are fantastic in bed.  
But once you start to get some experience, you’re naturally going to want to move up the ladder and start laying 8s, 9s and 10s.  
This is a natural instinct, and it’s good. It’s okay to chase girls just because they’re hot. These girls want you to chase them. If they didn’t, they wouldn’t make themselves hot.  
Part of being a man is that you can appreciate a woman’s beauty and femininity. It gives you a charge. And pursuing women who are “out of your league” (by society’s false standards) also gives you a charge.  


&nbsp;


**9\. Seducing a 9 is no different from seducing a 5**  
The process of attraction is exactly the same. The only difference is that the hot girl’s frame is stronger than the chubby girl’s.  
But ultimately, no matter how strong a hottie’s frame is, your frame will always be stronger, because you’re a man.  


&nbsp;


**10\. Women will test you brutally when they want to sleep with you**  
When you approach any hot girl, she’ll test your frame HARD to see if it’s strong.  
She’ll act like a bitch. She’ll pretend to ignore you. She’ll tell you outright to go away.  
She wants to see if you’ll buckle to social pressure, or if your frame will remain calm and consistent regardless of external feedback.  
She actually WANTS to sleep with you — but she needs to test your strength first.  
Don’t be fooled by the bitch persona for a second. It’s a carefully cultivated TEST.  
Most men fail the test because they don’t even realize they’re being tested.  


&nbsp;


**11\. Fight Club analogy**  
Getting a hot woman into bed is like the hazing scene in Fight Club where the new recruits are lined up outside the door.  
Tyler berates the recruits with personal insults. “Too old, go away.” “Too fat, go away.”  
He forces them to stand outside for days. He tells them there’s no possibility they’re getting in. Most give up. But the few who stay are ultimately invited inside.  
Seducing the hottest women is the same. It’s a WAR OF ATTRITION.  
Women will fuck pretty much any guy who’s around at the end of the night so long as he has a stronger frame than she does.  
But you have to stick around. You can’t leave when she insults you or acts like she doesn’t want to talk to you. If you do, you’re failing her tests.  
We’ll get into the mechanics of passing these tests in a moment. First we need to talk about inner game, which is the basis of out-framing anyone.  


&nbsp;


---------


&nbsp;


**PART 2:  INNER GAME**  


&nbsp;


**12\. The battle is won or lost inside you before it’s ever fought**  
We’ve said that the only way to AROUSE a woman to the point that she wants to sleep with you off cold approach is to pass her tests.  
How do you pass these tests?  
The first principle is to understand is that all tests are FRAME tests. The entire purpose of tests is to see if you have a strong frame that won’t buckle under pressure.  
Therefore, it’s useless begin with talking about “how to pass tests”. The real value is in having a strong frame to begin with. As Sun Tzu says in the Art of War, “every battle is won or lost before it’s ever fought.”  


&nbsp;


**13\. The “I am enough” frame = the gold dust that gets you 9s and 10s**  
The basis of your inner game is the idea that “you are enough”. In other words, you have value to women simply because you’re a man.  
Everything else is built upon that foundation.  
You don’t have to “do” anything to attract a girl. She’s attracted to you simply because you’re more relaxed than she is.  
You don’t have to change anything. You don’t have to improve your “game” beyond what it’s at now. You don’t need to become better looking.  
You CAN do all these things if you want and they will help you. But you don’t have to.  
You’re already “good enough” simply because you’re a man — because you’ve got testosterone and a dick. Women value that.  


&nbsp;


**14\. Men and women are meant to get together**  
We fit together like a key and a lock.  
There have been studies done in which women smell men’s sweaty t-shirts, and it changes the chemistry of their brain — making them more relaxed and calm.  
Your “male-ness” is inherently attractive to women. Same way as their femininity is inherently attractive to you.  


&nbsp;


**15\. Standards are a myth — everyone is a horny scoundrel**  
We have been brainwashed in our culture into believing that people (women) have something called “standards”.  
Women don’t have any standards — not really. Neither do men.  
Imagine you’re naked in bed with a “4”. She’s kinda chubby, plain face, you probably wouldn’t be proud of the lay, whatever. But her skin’s soft, she smells good, and she’s naked and wet.  
Are you going to say no?  
Probably not, if we’re being honest with each other. You’d almost definitely fuck her if you could be CERTAIN that (a) she’d leave afterwards, and (b) no one would find out.  
There’s a natural magnetism between men and women. We have no willpower around each other.  
Women are the same way. Take it from someone who’s “shot out of his league” too many times to count.  


&nbsp;


**16\. Be her cheat meal**  
You can be a “4” and she can be a “9”. *If the circumstances are right*, she’ll fuck you so long as there’s no downside. Why? Because sex feels good.  
Even the hottest, slimmest yoga bunny pigs out on pizza every once in a while. It’s human nature. We’re not strong. We’re weak.  
We pretend to have “standards” to the outside world. But down deep inside, no one has any standards, and we know it. We have no will, no self-control.  
Hot women are the same.  
If you can hold frame, pass a woman’s test, and lead her to somewhere sex can happen while creating plausible deniability, she WILL fuck you.  
You’d be amazed how easy it is when you get it down.  


&nbsp;


**17\. Stop thinking you need to be an “alpha” to get hot girls — helpful at first but it will ultimately stress you out**  
Your frame is: “I am enough.”  
Your frame is NOT “I’m a badass alpha who’s better than everyone”.  
That’s hard to uphold in the face of conflicting evidence, and will cause cognitive dissonance and stress.  
It’s simply: “Women and men are meant to get together. I’m a man. Therefore, women are already attracted to me on some baseline level.”  
That’s not a hard frame to maintain. It doesn’t stretch the truth. It doesn’t cause cognitive dissonance.  
And therefore it’s MUCH MORE RESILIENT in the face of tests and resistance — which is the most CRITICAL element to getting the hottest  girls.  


&nbsp;


**18\. Cultivate a “reality distortion field”**  
In order to do this, you must fully INTERNALIZE the “I am enough” belief system.  
Understanding it in theory isn’t enough. You have to feel it with your whole “mass”. You have to believe it with total, unquestioning, brainwashed conviction.  
The more you think about the idea that there’s no reason you’re not enough, the more it will feel “true”. (Things become true to us through repetition, not through logic.)  
Use self-hypnosis if necessary. Find every reason you can to support the belief that you’re enough, while cultivating “deliberate blindness” to anything that contradicts it.  
Don’t be a slave to logic. Make logic a slave to you. This is how you cultivate a “reality distortion field”.  


&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**PART 3: HOW TO MAKE WOMEN HORNY BY PASSING THEIR TESTS**  


&nbsp;


**19\. Enduring tests = building attraction**  
When you approach a woman, she immediately starts testing you. By passing her tests, you demonstrate that your frame is stronger than hers. This makes her horny for you.  
Women are wired in such a way that they can’t become wet for a man unless he’s overcome some kind of *resistance* to get her.   Hence, tests actually help you to seduce her. You want her to test you. The more tests you endure, the faster she’ll sleep with you.  
When a girl is so into you that she doesn’t test you, this is how you end up on a 3rd date with a woman who still won’t put out.  
Tests are your friend.  


&nbsp;


**20\. Passing tests is where ALL attraction is ultimately generated.**  
Attraction is NOT generated by pickup lines and witty comebacks.  
Attraction is NOT generated by manipulation techniques.  
Attraction is NOT generated by looks or money.  
All of these things WILL increase your probabilities of getting laid, and make your game smoother and more streamlined.  
But they’re NOT what builds ATTRACTION.  
The one and ONLY thing that builds attraction is ENDURING A WOMAN’S TESTS.  
The reason for this is obvious when you think about it:  


&nbsp;


**21\. Enduring her tests = ability to overcome adversity = GOOD GENES**  
Women have to see you have a strong frame, because otherwise they have no confidence that you’ll be able to protect them and remain calm in the face of danger.  
And the ONLY way they can figure out if you have strong frame is by testing you, being bitchy, insulting you, brushing you off, ignoring you, etc.  
That might seem “unfair” to you.  
But if you can’t handle the abuse from some blonde chick in a bar, how the fuck are you going to handle beating a 7ft tall man to death with your bare hands when he and his tribe invade your village and try to gang-rape your girl?  
Think about it.  


&nbsp;


**22\. Women aren’t built for Starbucks. They’re built for the African savannah.**  
Women aren’t built for the modern world. They’re built for nature, red in tooth and claw.  
If you understand that, you’ll do things differently. You won’t take it so personally when you approach a girl and she tries to destroy you.  
It’s necessary.  
Hot women aren’t acting bitchy to you because of feminism. They’re acting bitchy to you because they WANT to fuck you — but they can only do so after they’ve proved that you have a stronger frame than they do.  
This is instinctual. It’s part of the natural order.  
Innate female bitchiness existed long before feminism. Testing men who approach them is encoded into female DNA.  
When you get bitter at hot women for testing you, you’re being just as anti-nature as feminists themselves.  


&nbsp;


**23\. Eliminate self-destructive beliefs**  
There’s a common myth in the seduction community that a girl who acts “bitchy” to your approach is fundamentally flawed and therefore “not worth pursuing”.  
This is totally ludicrous.  
In fact, it’s just an incidence of “sour grapes” — cognitive games we play with ourselves to rationalize that the grapes we can’t reach are sour.  
The reality is that if a girl has ANY VALUE WHATSOEVER, then she will test you hard during your first approach.  


&nbsp;


**24\. Embrace tests**  
Do you want a woman who says yes to every cock who comes along without putting up the slightest resistance?  
Or do you want a woman who actually DISCRIMINATES among men based on their value — and who CHOSE YOU over hundreds of other suitors because you had the highest value?  
If you’re a normal, healthy man, you want the second woman — and that means you must LOGICALLY EXPECT her to test you hard, and to test you with everything she’s got.  
And you must not only expect tests, but APPRECIATE them.  
You LIKE it when a girl acts bitchy on your approach. It means that if you settle down with her, she’s likely to act bitchy to OTHER GUYS who approach her, scaring them away.  
The higher a woman’s value (in looks and character), the harder she will test you by ACTING “boring” and “bitchy”. This is the way it is and will be. This way and not some other way.  
Luckily, passing tests is the fastest way to create arousal and horniness. This means that, paradoxically, the hottest women are often the easiest to seduce if you know how to pass their tests.  


&nbsp;


**THE TWO CATEGORIES OF “TESTS” HOT GIRLS WILL GIVE YOU, AND HOW TO PASS THEM**  
Women will give you two types of tests — active tests and passive tests.  


&nbsp;


**25\. Active tests**  
Active tests are covered frequently in PUA literature.  
When a woman insults you, belittles you, mocks you, or says something provocative to get a reaction — these are all examples of active tests.  
Common “brush-off” lines like telling you she has a boyfriend, saying you’re a nice guy, telling you LJBF — these are also active tests.  
I won’t talk much about passing active tests as this material has already been done to death in the redpill/PUA world. (Just look up anything on “shit tests”.)  
Suffice to say, the best way to pass active tests is to either:  
a. Agree and amplify.  
b. Ignore the test and continue as if you didn’t even hear it.  
Generally speaking, getting active tests is VERY GOOD. If the girl’s actively testing you, it means she’s definitely interested. It’s also a very easy way to demonstrate your strength of frame by being a charming asshole in response.  


&nbsp;


**26\. How to get past her “bitch shield” persona and into her knickers: recognize and endure passive tests**  
But there is another type of test, which is MUCH more important to understand.  
This is the PASSIVE TEST. This is almost NEVER covered by PUA/redpill literature — yet these tests are actually the most COMMON you’ll encounter, particularly when dealing with 9s and 10s.  
Passive testing happens when you approach a girl and she appears to be INDIFFERENT, BORED, or ALOOF.  
“Resting bitch face” is a passive test. Giving you only one word answers is a passive test.  
And — my favorite — when you go to approach a hot girl and she looks at you with a face of half-disgust, half-horror, and runs away.  
Utterly BRUTAL as it seems — yes, even THAT is a test.  


&nbsp;


**27\. Don’t confuse passive tests with “rejection”**  
99% of guys interpret passive tests as REJECTION. Even natural alphas do.  
And that’s totally understandable.  
I mean, it makes sense right?  
If you approach a stunner and she takes one look at you before making a “creeped out” face to her friend, and then they run away — that’s obviously a rejection, right?  
Well, what if I told you that at least half the women I’ve slept with in my life reacted like that (or similarly badly) when I approached them?  
Here’s a particularly good example:  


&nbsp;


**28\. “Rejection” is not rejection**  
There was this girl I went to college with. Brunette, hot, did modeling work in her spare time, socially was one step down from a “minor celebrity” in my city.  
Probably one of the 10 or 15 hottest girls in my college.  
I always wanted to fuck this girl, because she seemed smart and interesting as well as just hot. But I rarely saw her around.  
One day she passed me in the stairwell, and I thought “this is probably the only chance I’m ever going to get”.  
So I approached her and blurted. “Hi, I’m Mike”. Good eye contact. Held my hand out to shake hers. Whatever.  
She looked at me like I had leprosy.  
I mean, she literally RECOILED. Her eyes went wide in horror, as if I was trying to infect her with AIDS.  
She shook my hand limply and muttered some social nicety back, then ran away swiftly.  
WOW… Now THAT’S a rejection, right?  
Well, the story has an addendum. That woman is now my girlfriend. Has been for three years. She’ll probably be the mother of my children.  
So what’s going on here?  
If she was attracted to me (which she later told me she was), why did she appear to “reject” me?  
Answering this question is the THE KEY to mastering all of game and social dynamics. You ready?  
Ok, here we go:  


&nbsp;


**29\. You are TOO HIGH VALUE**  
Yes, you read that correctly.  
When you’re getting “rejected” by girls, it’s because YOU’RE TOO HIGH VALUE FOR THEM, and it makes them nervous and self-conscious.  
Stay with me here. I know this sounds paradoxical, but try to grasp it.  


&nbsp;


**30\. Women are nervous around you**  
When you approach a woman out of the blue, it demonstrates a LOT of value. More than you probably realize.  
This is because 97% of guys DON’T APPROACH AT ALL. (Those who do are usually drunk and sloppy.)  
This means that if you’re an average to fair looking guy, and you cold approach a girl, you’ve just put yourself in the top 3% of men in terms of confidence.  
In other words, she is going to naturally ASSUME that you are an alpha male (whether this is true or not).  
This makes her NERVOUS and SELF-CONSCIOUS. She’s ill at ease around you because she wants to make a good impression.  
So she tries to act “cool”, “aloof”, and “standoffish”… because she feels awkward.  
She says bitchy things… because she can’t think of anything else to say.  
She run aways… because she feels anxious around you and doesn’t know what to do next.  
In other words: you’re coming across as TOO HIGH VALUE.  
Women are nervous around you. Be patient with them!  
Dumb yourself down. Hold frame, tease them, keep smiling warmly.  
Eventually they’ll open up and start laughing, flirting back, and ultimately get turned on by the fact that you out-framed them in a way no other man ever has.

**BONUS:  THE 6 MOST COMMON TESTS HOT GIRLS WILL GIVE YOU AND HOW TO PASS THEM IN A WAY THAT BUILDS ATTRACTION**  


&nbsp;


**#1\. You approach her, say hi, and she makes a weird face, or pretends to ignore you.**  
Simply keep talking as if you expect her to talk back. She’s nervous and self-conscious and *doesn’t know what to say*. That’s why she’s acting “bitchy” — you’re too high value for her and she feels anxious, causing her to try to act cool.  
Don’t react to her. Keep your body language open and relaxed. Warm smile, unwavering eye contact. Keep talking. Eventually she’ll start talking back and responding positively.  


&nbsp;


**#2\. You’re talking to a girl and she acts indifferent or aloof, only gives you one word answers, or keeps looking off into the distance**  
Again, you simply have to ENDURE IT. Keep talking, keep being playful. Teasing her a little bit never hurts either. “Are you this charming with all the guys?” “This bitchy cheerleader persona you’re putting on is really turning me on, please keep it going ;-)”  
When she sees you’re not going to go away so easily, her frame will crack. She’ll start to smile. Attraction.  


&nbsp;


**#3\. You’re talking to a girl and she leaves to go to the bathroom, says “I have to go find my friends”, or runs away for no apparent reason.**  
Let her go. Then re-approach her later. I can’t tell you how many girls have run off on me, then I approach them half an hour later and they’re like “Oh it’s you!” and then we hook up.  
Why do women leave? Again, they’re NERVOUS.  
Have you ever approached a hot girl and things were going TOO WELL? The girl is smiling and laughing…. she’s responding well… and…. you freak out! You don’t know what else to do, but you don’t want to fuck it up, so you leave set!  
GIRLS DO THIS TOO. Women will “run out of things to say” and run away because they’re nervous and overwhelmed by being in a high value person’s presence, same as guys will.  
Let her go, then re-approach her next time you see her.  
She will respond extremely well 90% of the time in my experience. She’ll literally be GRATEFUL to you that you gave her another chance. Women have told me this explicitly.  


&nbsp;


**#4\. If you’re talking to a girl and she tells you outright that you should leave, or says “well, you should go back to your friends”, “it was nice meeting you”, etc.**  
Smile, nod, agree, and then continue talking to her as if she said nothing. Never leave set because a girl tells you to.  
SHE can walk away if she wants. She has that right.  
But in a public space like a bar or nightclub, you’re well within your rights to talk to whoever you want.  
It’s Saturday night. It’s a social environment. You’re mixing with people.  
You’re free to talk to whoever you want, and she’s free to walk away at any time.  
But if she tells YOU to leave, it’s simply a test of your frame. She wants to see that you won’t buckle under social pressure.  
Pass the test by ignoring it. If she tells you to leave again, look her in the eye with a sly smile and say “You’re free to go if you want to.”  
Her eyes will light up and she’ll punch you in the arm. Pussy dampening commences.  


&nbsp;


**#5\. You’re talking to a woman and there’s an uncomfortably long lull in the conversation.**  
Stare into her left pupil while saying nothing. Instant sexual tension.  


&nbsp;


**#6\. You approach a woman, or a group of women, and they attempt to mock or belittle you.**  
They’re nervous around you because you’re the alpha male in the environment. (As demonstrated by the fact that you approached.)  
They feel uncomfortable in your presence because you’re high value, and so they’re trying to maintain frame by making nervous jokes.  
Smile, nod, agree, and keep talking to them AS IF they were being perfectly nice to you. If you act like they’re being civil, eventually their frame will buckle to yours and they actually WILL begin to act civil.  
That’s the nature of having a stronger frame: you create reality. Other people adjust themselves to it.  


&nbsp;


---------


&nbsp;


**TL;DR**  


&nbsp;


**1\.** Women value you because you have a STRONGER FRAME than them. That’s all.  
**2\.** To figure out if you’ve got a strong frame, women test you. These tests come in the form of indifference, bitchiness, aloofness, personal insults, etc.  
**3\.** You don’t have to do much to pass these tests. You just have to ENDURE them, keep talking to her, teasing her a little and being normal. Over time, her frame will buckle and she’ll become aroused by you because she sees you have a strong frame that can’t be pushed around.  
**4\.** Attraction is a passive, not an active process. You attract hot girls by outframing them. You outframe them by enduring their tests without it breaking your frame. Eventually they “buckle” to you and become wet, laugh at your jokes, ask you what you’re doing later, etc. Then you can take her hand and lead her to the sex location and she’ll be compliant.  
**5\.** The hotter the woman, the harsher will be her tests. Paradoxically, this can actually make hotter women easier to attract, because if you can endure her tests you stand out massively from other guys. Compare to an average girl: her tests won’t be as hard, so you have to pass more of them and spend more time with her before she can see you’re strong

for the last five years, i tried to follow buddhism monk rules.
monks are allowed to speak only 7 words to women. they cannot touch them and they cannot stare at them. also, they cannot be in a room/house alone with a woman.


at first, these rules seem kind of silly/impractical, but iam practicing them as good as i can and achieving good results overall.
the brain and body are adopting to the idea, that there never will be sensual/emotional interactions with someone. it takes a lot of time to truly understand this fact. both rational and subconscious.

it can be a peaceful mindstate. without the sexual urge and craving for emotional (fake) support, you can truly start to discover yourself in whatever way you want.

personally, iam in no way perfect. i just want to propose the general idea of acceptance. with acceptance comes peacefullness and happiness. i mean, what are alternatives? no women means now humanity. they are an equal part of the human race, so i think acceptance is the only true way to go.

tl;dr follow buddhism monk rules and let women be women. they can do whatever they want and you do whatever you want. they wont care and you wont care, no interaction/emotions involved from either side.

Master the triggers for sexual attraction outlined in this article, and beautiful women you’ve just met will make the above statements regularly. 

There are five elements to creating an irresistible sexual attraction: 1. Intent 2. Tension 3. Eye Contact 4. Mystery 5. Sexual conversation. Fortunately, there are simple, practical tricks you can learn that will allow you to master each of these elements with ease.

	                                   Intent

Intent can be such a murky concept. Although it might seem like you’ll have to fine-tune your chakras or meditate in a cave to master intent, it’s actually a concept grounded in human psychology. Put simply, intent is your expectation of what is going to happen in an interaction with a woman. 

Intent is mostly expressed in feelings. Humans evolved mirror neurons that allow us to feel what people we interact with are feeling. This allowed people to avoid dangerous situations, if someone had a bad intent, they could feel that something was off, and so they would exercise caution in that interaction. Similarly, if you are nervous, a woman will be able to feel that, and she will assume that you must be nervous for a reason, your intent will make her lose interest in you. Conversely, if you feel confidently attracted to her, she’s much more likely to feel the same for you.	
 	
So, if you expect a girl to like you, she’s more likely to become attracted to you. How do you learn to project a strong intent? No, you don’t need to align your chakras or meditate in a cave. You can build your intent through a technique that psychologists use to treat anxiety, conscious reinterpretation. 

Harvard scientists ran a study in which they caused participants to feel socially anxious by making them give a speech in front of an audience. The first group wasn’t given any special instructions, and unsurprisingly their levels of social anxiety were high and their performances suffered as a result. The second group was given a very simple exercise to practice. Whenever they felt nervous, they were to tell themselves, “I feel excited.” They were instructed to reinterpret anxiety as excitement. The audience scored the second group as performing significantly better, and participants in the second group also self-reported feeling more calm and confident. 

How do you use this to change your intent? If you are nervous talking to a girl, you can do exactly what participants in the study were instructed to do, tell yourself, “I am excited.” Over time, as you practice this, your anxiety will turn into excitement, and she will feel this excitement off of you, and therefore feel more positively towards you. 
	
But you can take this even further, when a girl makes you feel anxious, you could interpret that as nerves, but you could also interpret that as sexual attraction. In fact, the feelings people feel when they are nervous and when they are attracted to someone are almost identical: butterflies in the stomach, fast heartbeat, and even sweaty palms. If you feel that these symptoms are a bad thing, they will make you feel uncomfortable, if you feel that they are your body’s way of telling you that you should talk to someone, they will be positive. When you see a girl you like, and you feel the symptoms of attraction, tell yourself, “Damn, she’s attractive, I need to talk to her.” 
	
One of the largest psychology studies of all time found that the most powerful trigger for attraction is the feeling of being genuinely liked by someone else. When you learn to accurately reinterpret anxiety towards a girl as attraction for her, you will allow yourself to feel more attracted to her, and as a result, she will feel more attracted to you. This is the power of a strong intent.
	 
                               Sexual Tension

Negs, pushes, emotional spikes, are all techniques used to build sexual tension. Unfortunately, they are also the most misused techniques in the pickup community. I’ve floundered with these techniques many times myself, I would walk up to a girl I thought was particularly attractive, and I would start berating her with negs. I was overtly teasing her to raise my ‘perceived value’, and to make her feel a lack of validation. Suffice it to say, this didn’t build attraction, it just led to uncomfortable, and short, interactions.

Why? For any teasing technique to work, there’s an important nuance that must be understood. Before you tease, you and a woman must be in rapport for it to have a positive effect. If you and her aren’t on the same wavelength, aren’t vibing, than these techniques are meaningless. 
	
However, if a girl is connecting with you, and then you strip her of validation, it will build a powerful sexual tension. To get her validation back, she will start to chase you. There are many lines you can use to make a girl chase you, for example, if she says she’s from California, you can say, “I hate California.” If you were already in rapport with her, this will feel invalidating, it will make her wonder if you really like her. This creates a psychological vacuum effect, to ease her discomfort, she will start to chase you and earn your validation back. 

There are numerous effective techniques, the key is to only use these techniques after you’ve already built rapport with a girl. The power of this simple strategy will shock you. 

                                 Eye Contact

Eye contact can trigger attraction on its own. Famed evolutionary psychologist David Buss writes in his book, Why Women Have Sex, “In one study, forty-eight women and men came to a lab and were asked to stare into each other’s eyes while talking. The effect of mutual gaze proved powerful. Many reported that deep eye contact with an opposite-sex stranger created feelings of intense love. Another study had strangers first reveal intimate details of their lives to each other for half an hour, and then asked them to stare into each other’s eyes for four minutes— without breaking eye contact or making any conversation. Participants again reported deep attraction to their study partners. Two of these total strangers even ended up getting married!” 

Eye contact is powerful, but how do you improve it? Whenever you are in a location with women, improve your eye contact with this simple game. Whenever you see a woman, look at her eyes, if she doesn’t look at you, avert your gaze after 3 seconds, if she does look at you, hold eye contact until she looks away from you. 

Over time, this simple technique will lead you to make powerful eye contact effortlessly in all of your interactions with women. Your ability to create attraction will be significantly magnified. 

                                Mystery

Like intent, mystery can be a vague, hard-to-understand concept. In high school I learned that it was attractive to be mysterious, and I heard that to be mysterious meant not to talk much. So, to become mysterious, I just didn’t talk to girls. Maybe this did cause me to create an aura of mystery, but I was missing the point.
 
To be mysterious, you simply have to make a woman curious about you, you have to leave her with unanswered questions. Mystery is attractive because it shows that you have depth, and women get bored of the constant barrage of uninteresting, simple, guys that try to get in their pants. Show that you are different, offer her some mystery, and you will trigger attraction. 

How can you do this without learning complicated routines? Say one line that she won’t be able to get out of her head. Tell her something she doesn’t usually hear, something provocative, something that will make her wonder about you. 

My personal favorite line to accomplish this? 
	
“I bet you don’t meet a guy like me every day.”

This line has an insidious effect. It proves itself true, very few men would say something so cocky, and simply saying this line proves that you are different from other guys, because other guys don’t talk like that. 

This line creates mystery, because she will wonder exactly what it is that makes you different? She will want to know why you would say something like that, she will want to know why you have so much self-confidence. She’s going to want to solve this mystery, and the only way to do so, is to spend more time with you. 

                           Sexual Conversation

What happens when you think about sex? Assuming you don’t have some kind of dysfunction, you get aroused. If you talk about sex, you will make a woman more attracted to you because of a strange phenomenon called the misattribution of arousal. 
	In the famous bridge study, participants crossed a nerve-wracking swaying bridge with a 230 foot drop to the river below. On the other side, they were approached by an attractive female lab assistant and given a short survey. Afterwards, she gave them her phone number so they could call if they had any further questions. Half of the participants called the lab assistant after crossing the rickety bridge, and several even asked her on a date.

This is in contrast to the participants who crossed a safer, more stable bridge, none of whom asked the assistant on a date.

This is because, like I mentioned earlier, the symptoms of anxiety and attraction are very similar. Participants who crossed a dangerous, rickety bridge were brought into a state of heightened emotional arousal. They were still in this state when talking to the attractive lab assistant, and afterwards they decided to ask her on a date because they thought their anxiety from crossing the bridge was attraction to the lab assistant. 

Similarly, if you bring sexuality into a conversation, it won’t make a woman attracted to you directly, but thinking about sex will turn her on, and she will naturally associate her feelings of sexual arousal with the person she is interacting with, you.

How can you bring sex into a conversation without it being uncomfortable or awkward? Play the question game. The rules are simple, you each ask questions of each other, the more personal the better. Questions can’t be repeated, and if either of you are uncomfortable with a question, you can ask to have it replaced with another question. 

Tell her you want to play the game, explain the rules, and to start you can ask moderately sexual questions like, “What was your first kiss?” As the game progresses, ask progressively more sexual questions. Because it’s a game, nothing is off limits, and if you go too far, she can just pass to the next question. 

The question game will allow you to comfortably bring sex into your conversation, and as she thinks about sex, she will naturally associate those thoughts with the person she is talking to, namely, you. 

Conclusion

Integrate these five triggers for sexual attraction into your interactions with women and most women you meet will desire you. Women want to meet men who turn them on, but so few guys get it, so few men understand what really make a girl feel sexual attraction. These guys try to prove themselves with impressive jobs, nice cars, and big muscles. But women don’t want any of these things as much as they want a man who makes them feel good, use the techniques outlined in this article, and you can be confident in the fact that you will give women what they really want.

The fellows in the comments gave me enough mistrust to decide that perhaps I should check her messages right when she left the room (something I wouldn't normally do, because I trusted her), but almost like clockwork, I found a group message with her and her friends, with her talking about how she wants to fuck this guy in her study group, a guy that was previously flirting with her over text and when I confronted her about it before, she claimed that she didn't think it was flirting and that she could handle herself.

In any case, right when she came back in the room I confronted her about it and she tried to rationalize it in some absurd ways, but needless to say I said ""we're done"" and walked out right there. She's been trying to call me and knock on my door and shit, but I'm just keeping up no contact.

I call this the IRON LAW OF SEDUCTION. 

Understanding and correctly applying this law will solve 99% of the problems men have with women. She’s not responsive to your advances? Not emotionally invested enough. Not returning your calls? Not emotionally invested enough. Flaking? Not emotionally invested enough. On the flipside, as a man, if you emotionally divest yourself from girls, you solve most your own problems. Outcome dependent? You are too emotionally invested in getting laid. Approach anxiety? You are too emotionally invested in the success of the interaction. Neediness and desperation? You are emotionally invested in getting girls. Suck at conversations? You are too emotionally invested in getting laid and can’t just have a regular conversation. 

Emotional investment is subconsciously communicated and women evolved to sense it. One guy can talk to a girl all night without her feeling like he is emotionally invested, but another can talk to her for 2 seconds and get auto-rejected for being too invested. Of course, a woman may talk to you, hang out with you, fuck you, or even date you for a long time if she’s not emotionally invested because she’s horny, crazy, lonely, desperate, drunk, bored, want something from you, etc.... But if she’s not emotionally invested, you are on thin ice and vulnerable at any time to flaking or going cold.  

**What is emotional investment?**

Emotional investment is occupying one’s thoughts and emotions. It is not the same as being interested or “liking” somebody. I “like” a lot of people but I don’t “feel” anything for them and it wouldn’t hurt my feelings if they rejected me or even died.  This distinction is why women flake. Women “like,” get “interested,” and give their numbers to lots of guys, but if she is not at least a little emotionally invested she will not be motivated to get out of bed, put on her make-up, and come somewhere to meet you. Unlike men, women get invited to shit all the time by guys they “like” so they are not going to care about meeting you unless there is some emotional investment.  

Think about emotional investment like this: like most men, you probably like Lamborghinis. But like most men, you probably don’t have one, and you probably don’t spend all day thinking about Lamborghinis and being sad because you don’t have one. But if I lent you a Lamborghini for two months and you drove it around, took care of it, showed it off to your friends, and got laid because of it, you would be sad when I take it back. It’s irrational, but you would get emotionally invested in the Lambo even if you weren’t sad when you never had one. Because you became attached to it and it gave you a sense of identity and power, the Lambo took up space in your thoughts and emotions, making you emotionally invested. 

Emotional investment in people is similar. Being around somebody awesome and feeling like they “belong” to you  becomes addictive like crack. An awesome man makes a woman feel special, loved, important, powerful, and cool. An awesome man is also fun, positive, confident, carefree, and dominant, easing the woman’s anxieties and insecurities. Being around an awesome guy is literally like a drug to women, and if they are around you long enough, they become hooked. 

**The Ben Franklin Theory**
 
Ben Franklin, one of America’s founding fathers and greatest poonhounds, famously and counterintuitively discovered that if person A does something for person B, person A will like person B more. Most people would assume the opposite – if you want people to like you, you should do things for them, so person B should like person B more! Right? Wrong!

Person A “likes” person B more because person A has become emotionally invested. Maybe person A subconsciously expects person B to do something nice back. Maybe person A subconsciously see themselves as “beneath” person B in the ape hierarchy. Maybe person A is protecting their own ego – person B must be somebody special if even I did something for them! Or maybe the simple act of doing something for person B caused person B to enter person A’s thoughts and emotions.
 
Whatever the psychological mechanism, when a woman really likes you, she will WANT to do stuff for you, sometimes even aggressively, and she will WANT to emotionally invest while you fantasize about other things. When a woman really likes you is when you realize that needy, supplicating, validating behavior is not necessary. I have friends that are strippers, and their job is basically to hustle men out of money and to trick guys into buying shit for them. I don’t buy girls things, ever, (and I never, ever visit my friends at work) and I notice that when these strippers start to like me they buy me shit, clean my house, do me favors, etc... One night I even got into an argument with a stripper because she bought me 5 drinks in a row and she wouldn’t let me buy her a drink in return. That’s emotional investment.    
 
**The Woujo Theory**
 
According to my corollary of the Franklin theory, supplicating to a woman, validating yourself to a woman, buying a woman things, following a woman around, allowing a woman to treat you like shit, and spending too much time trying to “help” a woman who doesn’t deserve it subconsciously will cause you to become emotionally invested in her and feel “beneath” her.
 
Sometimes guys will do loserish things, like let a girl treat them badly or repeatedly pursue a girl who doesn’t care about them, and justify it by saying “I don’t really care about her, I just want to fuck.” This is a bad idea, because even though you consciously think you “don’t give a fuck,” by pursuing her, you become emotionally invested, and by allowing her treat you like shit, you subconsciously re-wire your brain to feel like a beta male. Even if you didn't give a fuck before, now you do. 

You can’t control how you feel, but you can control what you do. Where your actions go, your feelings will follow, and where feelings go, your thoughts will follow. If you do loser things, you will eventually feel like a loser, even if you consciously tell yourself you “don’t give a fuck.” If a hot girl tries to strike a Faustian bargain with you and let you fuck her in return for treating you like shit, you must reject that deal out of respect for your own mental health. 

Your brain works by making connections, and when you focus your thoughts and emotions on something, your brain starts connecting that thing to other things in your brain, and that thing becomes “enmeshed” in your wiring, creating a deeper web that is hard to untangle. For example, if you date a really hot girl, your brain will start to associate her with sexual pleasure, or ego, or fun times, and other things you like, so when she dumps you, you will think of her constantly. 

The definition of “not giving a fuck” is only keeping positive thoughts and emotions in your head, and cutting out people, places, activities, thoughts, media, etc... that are negative. “Not giving a fuck” is not about being cold, aloof, an asshole, or stupid, but by filing your thoughts and emotions only with positive things that deserve to be there. 

**Why is emotional investment unattractive?**

Emotional investment is an immediate turn-off. It doesn’t matter why, but I can guess some reasons. 

First, emotional investment is unattractive because people are attracted to lives that are more interesting, exciting, higher, and better than our own. We just assume that somebody living a better life than us is going to be thinking and feeling about their awesome life, not us. If a woman knows she occupies your thoughts and emotions, she will assume your life sucks. She wants to fixate her thoughts and emotions on something higher, but if your thoughts and emotions are fixated on her, she’s back where she started. 

For example, a girl that plays soccer will be attracted to guys that are better at soccer than her because they will appeal to the part of her thoughts and emotions that are invested in soccer. I'm not saying she will never become emotionally invested in a guy who is worse at soccer than she is - she may invest in a guy for other reasons - but the guy is playing with a disadvantage. 

Second, emotional investment is unattractive because, simply put, emotions are bad and scary. Our society acts like “love” is an emotion and “our true selves” are our emotions, but that’s bullshit. Our value lies in what we can do when we are rational, what we’ve learned in our life, what we know how to do, and what we strive to achieve and be when we are clear-headed. Emotions are temporary and fleeting; but true love is a rational, credible commitment to your beloved’s well-being. In his dialogue the Phaedrus, the Greek philosopher Plato said that emotional love is a kind of madness – when things are going well, you are irrationally nice to the person out of proportion to what they deserve. When things are going badly, you are irrationally nasty to the person out of proportion to what they deserve. Women know that when you are irrationally nice to them you will eventually be irrationally shitty. 

Most of our emotions are selfish, irrational, unrealistic, uncontrollable, and oftentimes downright evil. Emotions are fundamentally needy: they always want something, even if the “want” is to help somebody. If you see a beautiful woman and think “I like her, and I want to make her happy and do nice things for her,” you’re lying to yourself. You want things FROM her. You want to fuck her, use her for an ego boost, have your friends see you with her, and make yourself feel better for being a “good person.” You don’t want to see her run off and be happy with another guy, you want her to be unhappy with you. When you show emotion women subconsciously know you want something and that puts pressure on them, and they run away. Women sometimes will hang out with guys they don’t like or aren’t attracted to in any way, just because those guys are not emotionally invested and are not putting any pressure on them.  

When you become extremely emotional, you fantasize about getting your beloved back or hurting them for the wrongs they did to you, you stalk them, you act weird, you feel depressed, you can’t function, etc… Love songs glorify these feelings, but these are not healthy feelings. They are signs of weakness. Women have these feelings things too (oftentimes much more deeply than men), and they know it’s a scary pit to be in, so if they sense for even a second that a man is feeling these things (or is even just slightly beginning to feel these things), they run away immediately. Women want an emotional rock. They want the lifeguard on the edge of the pool pulling them out, not somebody drowning with them. 

Women also take longer to get emotionally invested in men than men take to get emotionally invested in women. Men evolved to seek “fertile” women (big ass, big tits, healthy face) to impregnate as soon as possible. Women, on the other hand, evolved to find the strongest man in the tribe that could protect her and her baby, so they seek a larger group of traits, many of which are long-term traits (confidence, dominance, emotional stability, intelligence, etc…). It takes a woman time to figure out if a guy has these traits but a man can immediately be attracted to a hot girl. In every man-woman relationship there is a period of time where the man is emotionally invested, but the woman is still “rational” and feeling the guy out. Many men fuck it up here – they start acting creepy, or weird, overly nice, overly fixated, and the woman, who feels nothing, thinks the guy isweird or worse. 

Of course, emotions are a part of life and can be beautiful if channeled correctly. But you shouldn’t show your emotions to a woman until she has also developed those emotions. 

Third, emotional investment makes you stupid and saps you of your vitality and awesomeness. Tons interesting, smart, funny, cool, successful guys become vacant shells of their normal selves around women, partly because their thoughts and emotions are empty of everything that makes them awesome. If you are deep in a game of chess and I try to have a conversation with you about quantum physics you will sound stupid because your thoughts and emotions are full of chess. Seduction requires intelligence and creativity, but if your thoughts and emotions are just “durr, she’s a pretty woman” you’re going to fail. Because women are “rational” longer than men, they want to have rational, intelligent conversations about interesting shit. 

Another reason is power. It’s a sad fact of life, but humans are wired to look at relationships in power terms. We subconsciously rank everybody in a particular social situation from least to most powerful. Women are much more aware of the power dynamic because they are generally less powerful than men. And unfortunately, we subconsciously see emotional people as lower in the power hierarchy. The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche said, correctly in my opinion, that individuals higher in the social hierarchy do not feel emotions for people lower than them. The lower ranked apes evolved to obey and be obsessed with the alpha male because they need his protection and resources, but the alpha male feels nothing for the lower ranked apes because he does not need them for anything. 

Most importantly, women are not attracted to emotionally invested men because women are attracted to RESILIENCE. Resilience here means “the ability to confidently pursue your goals and not let anything or anybody perturb you.” 

Women are attracted to resilience because they naturally want a protector, and a protector’s commitment is only credible if he cannot be thrown off of his mission, whatever that mission is. If a protector becomes emotional, dishonest, distracted, or submissive, he can no longer be trusted to protect. We subconsciously see emotional people as weak because they can be easily controlled. If a guy is emotional about a girl, he is likely to agree with whatever she says, let her get away with bad behavior, etc… 

If a protector wavers for even a second, the woman becomes anxious and fearful, but a confident man with boundaries is not scared and cannot be thrown off of his mission. You must be a brick wall that cannot be moved or affected: if you approach her or escalate with her, it is purely based on your own desire, not her cajoling. At every moment you should think to yourself “am I doing this because I want to or because I am trying to impress her”? Sometimes you need to monitor her emotional investment on a moment-by-moment basis. 

**Subconscious communication** 

Women can quickly sense by your body language, words, demeanor, tone of voice and actions whether you are emotionally invested. Neither you nor her may consciously know you’re invested, but you will just “feel” unattractive to her. Sometimes very subtle changes in behavior (staring too long, asking a question that is too intrusive too early) can tip off that you are too invested. 

I use the “gravity theory” to gauge emotional investment. In social settings, high-value people are “bigger” and therefore “draw” lower-value people to them. If you look at any party, you will see hot girls usually in the center, relaxing and having fun, and guys literally surrounding them like planets around the sun. There is a reason these guys are called “orbiters.” If the girl gets up to leave, the guys may play it cool for a while, but they then get up to follow her. Your ultimate goal is to become the center of gravity so women are drawn to you, not vice versa, which is hard, because as a man you must approach. But even if you approach your demeanor and body language can exude the message of “I am the center of gravity, and I create a rip in space-time that compels you to come to me.” 

The subconscious subtext of an interaction is 99%. For example, the sentence “can I buy you a drink” can have a wide range of subconscious meanings depending on the tone, body language, context and emotion I deliver them in. “Can I buy you a drink” can mean “I want to fuck you,” “I feel like I owe you something and I want to pay you back,” “I’m a generous guy and I like to just people free things,” “you’re a good friend, and I want to show my appreciation,” “I’m a loser and I want to make you like me by buying you things,” etc… What matters is not your superficial words, but your subconscious context. 

Because seduction is mostly subconscious, I can’t teach you every detail of the walk, speaking style, body language, demeanor, etc… of a guy who is not emotionally invested. Even if I did, it’s too much for you to remember and process. I even doubted the efficacy of writing this article because it’s incredibly hard to “fake” an emotional state for a long period of time and most people will go back to behaving like what they feel they are.  

**The paradox of escalation**

So far it sounds like the right solution to get girls would be to just ignore them completely. You won’t look emotionally invested, right? Unfortunately, that doesn’t work. It is the man’s responsibility to approach and escalate because women do not get emotionally invested quickly and are afraid of rejection. 

To get a girl attracted to you, you must show at least some initial interest and escalate, luring her into becoming emotionally invested in you. Magicians use a technique called “forcing,” where they trick the person into thinking they are picking a random card out of the deck when the person is really picking the card the magician wanted them to pick. Seduction is similar: she should feel like she is picking you, not vice-versa. You are just opening the door to her. 

**The challenge of seduction**

Seducing a woman while you appear not emotionally invested is incredibly challenging. First, women’s aversion to emotional investment is mostly subconscious – consciously, women want the guy to show at least some interest. And it’s naturally hard to hang around a woman you like for a long period of time and not become invested to at least some degree. Beautiful women create a reality distortion field where men lose all concept of rationality, truth, normal standards of right and wrong, etc… You can say “you’re overthinking this, just be yourself,”, but women touch men’s strongest emotion, so many men literally forget how be themselves. When a beautiful woman walks into a nightclub a swarm of otherwise successful, rational, manly men immediately lose their fucking minds. They start begging for her approval, trying to buy her things, acting stupid, etc… 

And like I said earlier, men emotionally invest quicker than women, so we must be patient because our emotions push us to jump the gun and get right into lovey-dovey mode. And in non-romantic contexts, people become emotionally invested at the same rate, so you are used to the other person feeling the same as you if the interaction is going well. And when we feel emotionally invested in somebody, we naturally are going to want to elicit a positive emotional response. But trying to make a woman happy that is not emotionally invested comes off as validation-seeking, supplicating, bitch behavior. You must instead do what is RIGHT. A woman may seem cold, and we may think we can “warm her up” by being “nice” to her, but we should really just pursue our mission and have faith that she will emotionally invest even though she appears on the surface to not be attracted or care about you. Remember: women are constantly sizing you up, so even if they don’t look like they are attracted or paying attention, they are. 

Seduction is a gamble because you must have faith that eventually the woman will start to emotionally invest, knowing she might not. Sometimes she just won’t like you. Sometimes she just wants attention. Sometimes she is in love with you but won’t let it on. Some women are damaged and never emotionally invest in anybody – they see all men as objects to be used. This is why you must assume attraction – because you DON’T KNOW. 

**How to not be emotionally invested**

If you take away one thing from this article, it is this: a woman who is not yet invested in you must not occupy a big part of your thoughts and emotions. You must have your mind and heart on other things when interacting with women. Period. If she hasn’t made room for you in her head and heart yet, you shouldn’t make space for her in your head and heart. If you make this change right now, I promise your results will instantly improve. Women are the dessert to a good life, not the main course, and that’s how women should feel when you are talking to them. WOMEN WANT TO BE DESSERT.

Here are my main steps to not becoming emotionally invested:

1)      Realize you don’t need to emotionally invest

2)      Have an interesting and awesome life that occupies your thoughts and emotions.

3)      Have “abundance mentality” with respect to women.

4)      Have boundaries and be unperturbable.

5)      Focus on your own fun first.

**Realize you don’t need to emotionally invest**
 
This may be the most important step. I think a lot of guys emotionally invest in girls because society and pop culture subconsciously make us think that for a man to get a girl, he must supplicate to her and emotionally invest in her. In the movies, the confident, successful guy living his own life never gets the girl; instead the winner is the beta loser who falls in love with her from afar, and then spends the rest of the movie trying to “get” her, enduring multiple rejections and humiliations. These movies also teach that women are delicate flowers that need constant coddling and lovey dovey bullshit. That’s not how it works in the real world. 
 
Men also misunderstand women’s aversion to rejection. Women have a strong need to be “accepted” (as all betas do) and therefore are much more sensitive to rejection than men. The phrase “hell hath no fury like a woman scorned” is true. Dread game and “ignoring” women only works if she is ignoring you first. But if you outright reject her, or if she makes a move on you, or asks for acceptance, and you say “no” or she feels like you are ignoring her there is a strong chance she will emotionally “un-invest.” Because women have this strong need for constant acceptance and validation, men mistakenly think they must emotionally invest. But all you really need to do is not reject her or make her feel excluded. It’s a thin line between keeping a woman “accepted” and emotionally investing in her. 

To win this game, you should only do something for a woman if the woman would do it for you. If you want to buy her a drink, think about whether she would buy you a drink. If she wouldn’t, don’t. If she wants you to wait for her, think about whether she would wait for you. If she wouldn’t, don’t. If there is a girl you always say hi to, but she never says hi to you, stop saying hi to her. She knows who you are, she can say hi to you. It’s ok to “win” in relationships. 
 
Again, this is easier said than done. Society and your emotions team up to make you feel like you need to follow girls around, wait for them, put up with their bullshit, buy them drinks, etc… You must fight your feelingss and social training and have faith that if you stay the course women will become attracted. This requires the ability to say “no” to a woman (saying “no” is different than rejecting her) and the ability to walk away from her, even permanently. 
  
**Have an interesting and awesome life that occupies your thoughts and emotions**
 
Humans are wired to seek good feelings. If the main part of our life is not making us happy (job, school, our hobbies), we get those good feelings from other sources: drugs, trashy TV, women, food, etc… All those things are not bad by themselves, but if your regular life doesn’t make you happy, you will overly emotionally invest in bad things and become addicted and depressed. If your life is miserable, you will subconsciously and unknowingly immediately start overly investing in women.

I use the “cheese pizza method.” Whenever I feel like I’m getting too emotional, I fill my thoughts and emotions with something I love – cheese pizza, Oreo cheesecake, the day I did mushrooms at the beach, reading about dinosaurs stoned, etc... This clears my head and allows me to act “normal” around women. When I am thinking about doing something for a girl I ask myself “what has she done to dislodge cheese pizza out of my heart and mind?” You can replace cheese pizza with anything, ideally an incredible, thrilling life that she would want to join. 
 
**Have abundance mentality with respect to girls**
 
No matter how awesome your life is, it is hard to not emotionally invest in girls. Abundance mentality is when your thoughts and emotions are full of other women, so you don’t need this one girl. If you don’t have other girls, you need to delude yourself. I recall times when I did have abundance and put myself back in that mental space. If you’ve never had abundance, imagine you are Brad Pitt or some other celebrity and think about how he would feel and act.

**Have boundaries and be unperturbable**

Women want you to be an immovable wall that confidently and joyfully pursues his mission. She will try to perturb you from that mission, not because she wants to see you fail, but because she wants to test whether you are actually a brick wall or a façade for something softer. The same way you knock on a desk at the furniture store to see if it is real wood, a woman shit tests you to see if you are actually confident enough to pursue your mission or if you will be perturbed. And the more confident and immovable you are, the stronger the shit tests become. This is true even if the mission is getting her! As long as she is into it, you need to escalate as if you already know she will say yes.

Your mission, when out, should be maximum fun. She should sense that your emotional investment is “where’s the party? Where’s the next fun thing?” You should have a plan for the entire night: I’m going to X, then I’m going to Y , etc… You should not let the woman hijack your plans and take the lead. Your primary mission (career, hobbies, etc…) should also be in your head. Remember the song “girls just wanna have fun?” In truth, everybody just wants to have fun but boys are wracked with anxiety because they are trying to impress girls. Whenever you are feeling nervous, scared, anxious or like you are emotionally investing too much in a girl, just say to yourself “I’m here to have fun. If you contribute, great. If not, you are dismissed.” Fun and positivity always win. 

Example: If a beautiful woman is talking about something incredibly boring most men pretend to be interested. Wrong! Women know when they are being boring and it is sometimes a subtle shit test to see if you will let her get away with it. Women are not desperate for sex and they do not need to hang around if a guy is being boring, stupid or mean, and they cannot respect or empathize with a guy who would put up with bullshit from her. Men let women be boring when they lose their vision of the good life. A good life involves beautiful women, but it also involves interesting conversations. If you aren’t getting interesting conversations from her, you would leave because you have options. Whenever a woman is being boring, I change the subject just to let her know I don’t tolerate bullshit.  

By having a vision of the good life, boundaries, and confidence that your life, thoughts and emotions are interesting and valuable, you can challenge and stimulate a woman. Women want a man that will help them grow and introduce them to a better life and more interesting world than the one they currently inhabit. They don’t want some a that agrees with everything they say, a pushover, or a simple-minded conformist.  Women want a guy who is willing to walk away at any time, not because he is some cold-hearted psychopath, but because once a man shows that is he NOT willing to walk away at any time, there is no challenge or growth. 

Of course, for most of you, this is very difficult. Many of you have uninteresting lives so a beautiful woman would instantly become the most interesting and important thing your life or you are so sex starved and desperate that you don’t care if a woman is being boring, or mean, or uninterested, or whatever. 

**Focus on your own fun first**

Imagine you paid $500,000 to spend a week with Leonardo DiCaprio (or whatever celebrity you think lives an awesome life) and when you get there Leonardo says “tell us what we should do?” You would say “I don’t know, what are the options?” and Leo goes “I don’t have anything planned – let’s just do what you were gonna do.” You would be pissed! You want to become part of Leo’s awesome life, not make your own plan. That’s how girls feel when men don’t have a plan. They want to join your life, not lead you around in their life. That’s why you need to focus on your own fun first. You may like you are being rude or selfish, but you’re not, because women are more attracted to the act of leading than the destination necessarily. 

**How to make her emotionally invest in you**

For a woman to emotionally invest in you, certain shit must happen: 

1)	She must “like” you – i.e., she must find you pleasant, friendly, good-looking, compatible with her values and interests. 

2)	She must feel an emotional connection with you.

3)	She must feel accepted by you. If she you are rejecting her, ignoring her, or being hostile, she will not emotionally invest. 

4)	She must watch you be confident and resilient. 

5)	She needs to spend time around you. 

**She must like you**

This one is self-explanatory. Women are usually not going to invest in you if you don’t share their interests, values, goals, etc… Some girls want a rapper covered in tattoos, others want a nerdy guy who watches Star Wars. If you’re a versatile guy with lots of interests, a lot more women will like you, but some people just aren’t compatible. 

**She must feel an emotional connection with you**

The key to developing an emotional connection with a girl is experiencing emotionally exciting things together. The ultimate is of course, passionate sex, but a good concert, a deep conversation, even a beer pong game you guys play together can help build an emotional connection. 

Another way to build an emotional connection is for her to vicariously experience your confidence. She wants you to be her emotional rock, so she would like to project her insecurities and fears onto you, and watch you brush them off as if they were nothing. She also wants to watch you take the lead and make the night fun. 

A woman has emotional energy, and that energy must be directed towards something or somebody. You want that energy to be directed to you. The easiest way to do this is just by spending time around her. Just “being around” will help build attraction as long as you are not fucking it up by being needy or making her feel bad. The best way to get women to like you is to be “forced” to be around them, such as work or a group hangout, where you do not supplicate to them or validate yourself to them. My friend used to take girls out on his boat, and these girls would usually end up liking me by the end of the day because we would have spent all day together. Celebrities get so much tang because women watch them in movies or listen to their music and become emotionally invested, whereas the celebrity shows the women no emotional investment in all. 

**She must feel accepted by you.**

Again, hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, so it must feel like the door to you is open. As she invests in you more, you must escalate more. You can fuck this up by being an asshole, not being sensitive to her emotions, and not reading her advances correctly. 

**She must watch you confidently pursue your goals**

The word confidence comes from the Latin con (with) + fidens (faith). A man with confidence has faith that he will succeed in whatever he does and cannot be stopped by anybody. Women get turned by watching a man confidently pursue his mission. Why are women w so attracted to DJs, promoters, and drug dealers in the club? Those guys aren’t exactly the “cream” of society. It’s because those guys are the only people at the club actually doing something. All the other guys are just sitting there drooling over the girls, instantly reducing their attractiveness. 

**Putting it all together**

To apply all this knowledge, my strategy is to adopt a rational, almost businesslike demeanor, at least in the early stages of the interaction. As I said earlier, women are “rational” at the beginning before they are emotionally invested, so you should also be rational. A man must act almost like he is a woman: he is interested in a relationship (or maybe even just sex) but he has high standards and must evaluate the woman thoroughly first and make sure she is suitable before he gets emotionally invested. You should act like your actions are guided by a seduction computer that makes all the decisions based on the available information, not your emotions. 

One technique is called “disinterested interest.” Your rational words should show interest and enthusiasm but you must communicate the “emotion” of “I’m just talking to you to be nice, I am not totally emotionally invested in you yet and I could walk away at any moment.” The best way to do this is by keeping your thoughts and emotions focused on something else, other than her. 

You should not, however, stay completely rational. You must allow yourself to show your emotions about things that are not her: your passions, your interests, your friends, etc… And you can show emotion towards her if she deserves it: laugh if she says something funny, thank her if she does something nice, sympathize with her if she says something sad: just don’t let on that you feel emotional about “her” unconnected to anything she is or has done. 

And of course, escalate sexually. Paradoxically, it is possible to escalate sexually and not appear emotionally invested. In fact, a lot of women (especially damaged ones) are looking for emotionless sex. You must touch her, you must turn the conversation sexual, you must do “seductive” things like look into her eyes and whisper in her ear, etc… And you must confidently take the lead in the conversation and the situation in general, leading her from place to place, getting intimate with her, etc… And when she starts to emotionally invest, make her feel like you MIGHT emotionally invest too (but not as much as her). Sometimes if you play it “too” cool she will think you just like her platonically or that you lost interest. 

**A broader view**

This article is obviously about getting girls, but the principles are applicable in all areas of your life. Simply put, you should not invest your thoughts and emotions into people, places, institutions, and activities that do not give a fuck about you and/or do not produce a return that equals the investment you put into them. One of the biggest mistakes people make is investing too much in their job, friendship, hobbies, etc..., and getting 0 out of it. 

Additionally, whatever you do becomes your emotional investment. If you spend every weekend hanging out with piece of shit people that just do drugs, complain and make bad decisions, guess what, you are now becoming a piece of shit person. You are what you do.

The company seems to have branched out into producing other products that programmers use. It's all very hip and trendy, far removed from the traditional socially awkward hacker programming in some basement.

Recently they put out a call for speakers for a technical conference about some programming framework that they've set up. After the blind review process, the speakers were selected and published. So far, so good.

Then one woman notices that all of the speakers are men. She posts about this on Twitter [1]. The conference organisers respond by cancelling the conference, stating that the speaker list ""does not reflect the standards to which we hold ourselves."" and that they are ""postponing this event until we can deliver a more diverse slate of speakers"" [2]. So those speakers who were selected based purely on their merits? Not enough vagina.

I'm a professional programmer and I can tell you that it takes a ""special"" kind of person to be a really good programmer. Borderline autistic is a good start. One requires the ability to focus on the task at hand which such strength for hours at a time. And, of course, it requires an extremely logical brain. You can probably guess that all of the best programmers that have ever been are men.

Of course, some exceptional women will also display these talents. But they are rare. And even when they do appear, they often cause drama in the communities they take part in. Sarah Sharp was a Linux kernel maintainer. But she couldn't handle the brutal way in which other maintainers often communicate with each other. In these communities respect is something that has to be earned and if you don't deserve it, you will be told straight in no uncertain terms. Anyway, she ended up publicly quitting.

The sad thing about all this is that it is the male developers who will suffer. Employers are incredibly eager to hire female programmers. This always creates more work for the competent ones. And now it's harder for men to speak at conferences. There are literally no barriers to becoming a programmer. You just need a computer, which virtually everyone in a developed country has access to, and discipline. Given the extremely low barriers to entry, you would think that there would be plenty of competent female programmers. Or maybe they just aren't good at it, or aren't interested enough to become good. Who knows...

I paid no mind to it when I first saw it like half an hour ago, but I reloaded the r-all, as you often do, and I happened to see the second half of the headline about her: she went missing during a ""mixer."" Well, it kind of just clicked in my head instantly. She probably had a few too many drinks, and you could probably guess what happened next. I was intrigued. So I had a theory in mind as to why she went missing, and it wasn't long before I found that she had already re-surfaced and it turns out that she's fine. I wanted more info, so I kept searching, and lo and behold, she actually has a boyfriend/husband. It took no more than a minute of more searching to find this exchange they just had on twitter.

Need I say more?

My takeaway from this is, a bunch of white knights made it a point to take a non-occurrence and turn it into a national news story, no doubt thinking to themselves what good guys they all are for doing the right thing and helping a damsel in distress. When in reality, the girl in question was just having fun, as girls do, to the point that even her own bf had no idea what happened to her. And he still doesn't.

If he's any good as a man, this should be a glowing red flag that this bitch needs to be dropped. Here's hoping that everybody gets what's coming to them.

*Edit*: I should add that in both of the front-page posts where this topic is covered (primarily where the original call for help to find her was first announced by the random white knight), there are a lot of controversial and deleted posts. The first thread about it that I opened has also been locked as of this writing.

And this topic has been posted on at least 1 other subreddit as of this writing, specifically r-drama. And there you can find some RP comments about it, some that you would probably already be thinking yourself. I highly recommend that you go and take a look. This should serve as an example of the red pill theory stated thusly:

**Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks**

*Edit 2*: [The plot thickens](http://i.imgur.com/QAi1y9N.png)

*Edit 3*: [""She even sounds like she's been deepthroating.""](http://a.pomf.cat/lceuzz.mp4) - She posted this video as confirmation that she's alive and well but later deleted it, probably after she realized that her posting this confirms that she was in a hotel room with *someone* but fortunately, it has been backed up and here for us to see.

*Edit 4*: This will probably be my last edit on this for now, but I found this [twitter reply](https://twitter.com/asmiseasy/status/875628688833773568) where the BF was talking with a rando and she literally said the bitch is now gonna get kicked out no matter what she did. Hope he follows through.

*Edit 5*: Credit to user -Unnamed- for this recap of what has happened so far: 

>""She was supposed to be on a panel at e3 and at a booth or whatever. The day before she got drunk and went somewhere. Then no one heard from her for over twenty hours. As a girl who had an event to attend, tweets fucking constantly, and wasnt even contacting her husband, it was suspicious. The internet took off with it. Later she posted a video saying she's ok and just missed e3. But it was inside some sketchy hotel that no one recognized. So she deleted the video. Then later she posts a video from the road. But it turns out she's not the brightest bulb on the tree because that sidewalk was literally outside the same hotel. So weaponized autism on the internet pinpointed her location using clues from the two videos such as curtains and road signs in the background. Turns out to be some sketchy motel. They called the motel and used the missing persons report to see if anyone matching her description stayed there. They confirmed. Everyone started calling her out on twitter for cheating on her husband until she finally cracked and was like ""we aren't even together anymore lol""

>TLDR; thot blows off fans at e3 to blow off some dude in a motel

If that last part is true, and it has been confirmed that this girl and the supposed bf ""aren't even together anymore"" then this all becomes an even bigger shitshow. Apparently Beta Billy over here still thinks they're together but the missing princess thinks that's a load of shit? I can't even laugh it's so embarrassing.

*Final Edit*: Really glad this got massive attention on TRP, unfortunately our guy just doesn't get it at all.

She then finds out he was secretly rich and was *choosing* not to spend money on her and gets even more confused. Part one takes place in 2014.

**Part one - original**

> *TL;DR - My boyfriend kept his wealth a secret from me throughout our entire relationship. I ended the relationship on the pretext that he wasn't money/career motivated, he didn't say anything to the contrary. *

> I [F26] have been dating Will [M27] for most of 2014; I met him on New Years Eve, we exchanged numbers, scheduled a coffee date and have been seeing each other ever since. He's tall and shy, with long thick hair like Eddie Vedder. He lives in an older house by himself and drives a 1997 Toyota. He dresses very casually - I don't think he even owns a collared shirt - and all his clothes are minimum 1-2 years old. For income, he told me he ""ran a few websites"" and picked up piece-work as a 'session guitarist'. He is also very frugal. He never took me out for fancy dinners or anything. In the beginning it was always coffee dates, walks, hikes, etc. If we go out, he insists on 'pre-drinking' and refuses to buy drinks at a bar. Most nights he was content staying in, watching Netflix and playing his guitar.

> I never outright asked how much money he made, but given his lifestyle, clothes, furnishings, etc. plus the fact that he rarely worked, I assumed it wasn't much. I would lightly prod him with questions about the future, if he had any career goals - he would say that he ""saw me in his future"", but also he was ""happy the way things were"".

> I have Facebook and am on it every day, usually when work is slow. Lately my newsfeed has been filled with my peers getting married, buying houses, having babies, and other various accolades. I can't help but feel jealous by this; it seems like everyone but me is making significant gains in their lives and relationships. Three weeks ago, after seeing a girl I knew from high school buy her 3rd property with her husband, it felt like my relationship with Will was juvenile and had no future.

> The next time I was over at Will's (after he served me potato soup for dinner and was torrenting a documentary for us to watch later) I ended the relationship. I was perfectly honest about everything - he was a great guy, I loved him and his personality, but I felt he lacked career/life ambition and we wanted different things for the future. He sat and listened to everything, seemingly unmoved by it. When I finished talking, he said ""fine by me"" and asked me to leave. I went to hug him on my way out, instead he just guided me out the door and slammed it shut behind him.

> With prior boyfriends, we'd still talk or text a bit after we'd be broken up. Sometimes we'd even still hook up. I dunno, I've just never had a 'bad break-up' and always try to remain on good terms. I haven't heard a fucking word from Will, even after texting him multiple times and calling him once.

> I saw two of Wills friends at the gym today. I went over and made small talk, asked how he was, etc. I tried to explain myself, saying he was a great guy but our views on money and the future didn't seem to mesh. To this, one friend chuckled to himself and walked away. I asked the other friend WTF that's about it, and he says ""Yeah, we heard. The thing is, Will's loaded. He inherited his grandpas land which is leased to oil and gas companies. I've seen the quarterly checks he gets and they're more than my yearly salary. Good luck getting him to spend it, though. He has a 'if it aint broke, dont fix it' type mentality. Just look at that piece of shit he drives!""

> This has completely baffled and upset me. I dated him for 10 months when I thought he was penniless, proof I'm not a fucking gold-digger. I am a 26 year old woman who needs to be pragmatic, I can't just indefinitely date someone with the future being so uncertain. He could've said something, ANYTHING during our break up when I was explaining my doubts about our relationship. Instead he said nothing, and now he refuses to talk to me. It makes absolutely no sense.

>I just feel so low right now. If a man with disposable income meets a woman he likes, doesn't he want to treat her? He said he ""saw me in his future"", why didn't he care enough to share these things with me? He could have easily kept our relationship alive by being forthcoming. Someone please help me make sense of this situation.

Her lack of self awareness is astounding! I love how she just cannot seem to figure out why he's not talking to her after she broke up with him, why he told her to leave and didn't want to hug her goodbye after she essentially told him he wasn't good enough for her to stay in a relationship with. She just seems genuinely baffled - him accepting the break up and moving on is now a 'bad break-up'! 

**Part 2 - the update**

And here's where it gets glorious. A year later and she no longer broke up with him because of his frugality but because ""he had been dishonest about some things... [and she] couldn't come to terms with his lying by omission. It seemed he threw [their] relationship away over nothing.""

> In 2014 I went through a pretty bad break-up. I met Will at a NYE party hosted by a friend-of-a-friend and we dated for 10ish months. I loved him - it was probably the best relationship I'd had on a 'personal connection' level - but he had been dishonest about some things (not infidelity - 'life' things) and it led to us breaking up. I couldn't come to terms with his lying by omission - it seemed like he threw away our relationship over nothing.

>I was pretty unhappy for a while, not gonna lie. Went on a few dates, had a few Tinder flings, but nothing serious. Around summer 2015 is when things started to turn around and I felt I was in a good place. Happy with my job, happy with my body, happy with my social circle - just all-around happy and patiently waiting for Mr. Right to come along.

>My friends and I were invited to the same NYE party this year, hosted by the same person. I knew there was a chance my ex would be there, but I didn't care - I was over him. Seeing him and being cordial shouldn't have been a problem. He was pretty icy when the relationship ended, so even if he was there, I didn't expect him to say all that much to me.

>So my girls and I are there early, having a few cocktails and everything is going great... then Will walks through the door. He saw me, smiled, walked directly over and gave me a big hug. With his arms wrapped around me, smelling his cologne... I just melted. In that moment, whatever bad feelings I had about our relationship were completely gone. I just genuinely missed him.

>I got through 15 minutes of small talk with him, my heart racing the entire time. He remembered all these little details about me, my friends and my family - I couldn't believe it. When I told him about my job, my new apartment, etc. he seemed happy for me. When the conversation ended, he gave me another quick hug and then left toward the kitchen.

>My friends could tell that seeing him had affected me. They took me to a more private area of the house to talk it out; they reminded me to not get ahead of myself, he's still the same guy who lied to you, etc.

>When we went to rejoin the party, he was on his phone giving directions to someone. After a minute of eavesdropping it became clear that he was talking to his girlfriend. Fuck.

>I should've left then and there, but I didn't want it to seem like him having a new girlfriend affected me. Like I hadn't gotten on with my fucking life after 14 months apart. And so I stayed.

>She arrived about 10 minutes later and Will introduced her to everyone. She seemed nice enough, but seeing them together made me sick to my stomach. I swear she was being all touchy-feely with him just to spite me. I did my best to avoid them throughout the night. I found out through a friend that they'd been dating for 2 or 3 months. The party ended, I got into a car with my friends and just started sobbing uncontrollably. They tried to comfort me but I was too far gone. They dropped me off and I cried for while longer alone in my apartment.

>This was supposed to be a fun weekend with my girls, we had all sorts of stuff planned, but I ended up staying home by myself last night. No one questioned it, they all knew. I must've wrote 100 different texts to Will last night but didn't end up sending a single one. I'm going to stay in tonight as well.

>I want him back so bad, I just don't know what to do :(

I can't decide if my favourite part is her sobbing uncontrollably or how much of a boss Will is. I'm certain he's on here but if he's not he should be. Wherever you are Will TRP salutes you buddy.

A common scenario: a woman becomes pregnant by ""accident"", her fling/ex/one-night-stand does not want to be a parent, but the courts end up forcing the man to pay child support for the next 18 years of his life, most of which may never go towards the child. 

Of course, we are told that this is completely normal and acceptable. Both parents have a responsibility towards the kid. You can't opt out of being a parent. The child support is for the *child's* benefit. If you didn't want a kid, you shouldn't have had sex. And so on, and so on. 

Except when it's a man that's forcing his girl to pay child support. Then, according to much of Reddit, he's a scumbag, a lying asshole, his child is to be pitied for being raised by him, etc. 

In this instance, a 20-year-old man posted on Legal Advice asking for help. His ex-girlfriend was pregnant and wanted to put the child up for adoption when it was born, against his own wishes. He wanted to raise the child, even if he had to do so as a single parent. He said that he earned enough to support the child on his own and he was willing to take on the responsibility. 

He was informed that his ex could not put the child up for adoption without his consent and that he should get a lawyer, register his paternity, and push for his custodial rights. 

Yesterday, he came back with an update. He got a lawyer, managed to prevent his ex from putting the child up for adoption, and is now raising his daughter as a single parent, with his ex signing over her custodial rights. And oh yeah, after this all happened and he had his daughter, he also got his lawyer to file for child support and his ex now has to pay child support for the next 18 years, and she phoned him up livid, swearing at him and calling him every name in the book. 

A very common scenario that often occurs with the man having to pay the child support, but now that it's the woman, plenty of people have some choice thoughts for this man. 

> I actually feel terrible for the mother. Because if she didn't want the child, she could have easily aborted the baby and this man goes, after the mother gives him full legal custody, and makes her pay child support?

> I don't agree with this at all. (+723)

Yes, she definitely should've aborted her eight-month-old fetus to save money. 

> But that was the point of adoption, so someone could take proper care of the child. This just seems like dirty tactics. (+257)

Want proper care for your child? Put them up for adoption and send them off into the world! 

> She had a plan, but now has to pay child support instead because the father wanted full custody? (+420)

> Now, after he gets custody of the kid, he wants her to pay child support? That kinda negates the point of not being able to support the kid. I'd say that's a dick move on the dad's part. She should have terminated if she knew he would do that. (+596)

Another ""she should've aborted her almost full-term baby"" comment.

> Literally a post why she should have put it up, she'd be in much better position. Crazy. (+4)

If she put her daughter up for adoption, *she* would save money and *her daughter* would grow up without either of her birth parents. Imagine how much of a better position that would be!

> She let him have the kid without a fuss at the end but then he files for child support? Holy shit can't understand how someone could do that. And just imagine the Reddit shitstorm if it had been the other way. (+188)

""Imagine if this happened to a *woman*!""

> She was mislead and lied to. It is incredibly scummy and I now worry for this kid's future having a dad willing to so coldly lie and fuck over someone like that...There needs to be more reason in these laws. (+44)

> Total dick-move to sue for child support. She clearly and expressedly did NOT want this child. She made the process for OP to have the child easy as possible. Had she gone the adoption route, she wouldnt be on the hook for child support, but decided to give the father a chance to parent. Absolutely an asshole thing to do to her. (+10)

> What selfish prick. Also, what an excellent way to make that woman hate him until the day she dies.  (+14)

> I think it's a crappy thing to do, and if I was the mother, and he went after child support, I'd go after visitation rights. Then he may change his mind about wanting child support.

> I am glad I am not the only one that was distressed about the underhanded way he went about getting child-support. His lack of honesty really worries me. (+61)

> I'm conflicted regarding going after child support. In my head I feel it's wrong, if she had put the baby up for adoption then she wouldn't have to pay it for the next 18 years. However if the roles were reversed and the father wanted to put the baby up for adoption and the mother wanted full custody, then i think public opinion would be that the father obviously has to pay. The laws need to change regarding this topic for sure. (+19)

To be fair, at least half the people in that thread support him and think this is perfectly fine, maybe even the majority. But you can be sure that if this was a woman, nobody would've even blinked twice. 

When a woman is given the same treatment that men undergo all the time, she is seen as a victim. Furthermore, when a woman suffers the smallest consequences for her actions, people will excuse any and all behavior on her part (such as a late-term abortion of a viable fetus to avoid paying child support).",964,4,0.4620000123977661,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first",1

Stoicism philosophy is on the rise. I have been practising it for a couple of years now and would like to share 3 of the most effective and practical mental exercise/meditations that I have used.

##**Method One: A view from above**##

*'You can rid yourself of many useless things among those that disturb you, for they lie entirely in your imagination; and you will then gain for yourself ample space by comprehending the whole universe in your mind, and by contemplating the eternity of time, and observing the rapid change of every part of everything, how short is the time from birth to dissolution, and the illimitable time before birth as well as the equally boundless time after dissolution'* 

**– Marcus Aurelius**

Marcus Aurelius advises us to perform an exercise called 'view from above'. This exercise involves us envisioning ourselves from the third person. In this vision, we zoom out while keeping ourselves in the centre. We continue zooming out and contemplating the scale of the universe.  For instance, your first zoom might encompass a view of you from above the roof of your house. Increase the magnitude and you might see a view of your street, increase the magnitude and you might see a view of your country. Keep going until you can picture a view of Earth from the stars. 

With this scale, we can gain a better perspective on the insignificance of our problems. When compared to the universe whatever problems we might appear incredibly trivial.  For instance, if you were feeling down because a girl flaked on you or someone insulted you, try this exercise. It is far easier to overcome the emotional hurdles we experience when we put things into perspective. 

##**Method Two: Negative visualization**##

*'Remember that all we have is “on loan” from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission—indeed, without even advance notice. Thus, we should love all our dear ones, but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever—nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long.'*

**- Seneca**

Negative visualization despite the name is an exercise that will increase your default level of happiness if practised consistently.The exercise consists of you envisioning what it would feel like if you lost certain things from your life. 
Some of the things that you could consider during the exercise are:

•	How it would feel to not have a roof over your head.

•	How it would feel to lose social status.

•	How it would feel to live in a third world country.

•	How it would feel to have a physical disability.

•	How it would feel to lose a loved one.

This exercise is not meant to be dark or morbid, it’s meant to put things into perspective. Allowing you to see how lucky you truly are. It also prepares you for the worst case scenarios in which one of these things does happen. **You are not meant to fixate on these thoughts, but consider them from time to time.**

This is a very practical way for you to practice gratitude, naturally, when you consider things being removed from your life, you start to gain a sense of gratitude.
 Now gratitude is important because of a thing called ‘hedonic adaptation’, basically, it’s a term that defines the tendency for humans to always go back to their default level of happiness. 

If you won the lotto and became a millionaire, your base level of happiness will increase for a while. However, when you become accustomed to the lifestyle, despite all the new toys, you will return to your base level.
 Gratitude breaks this pattern, allowing you to enjoy each step on the ladder. You can be grateful when you own a box, and you can be grateful when you own a Lamborghini Avendator.  

##**Method Three: Voluntary Discomfort**##

*'But neither a bull nor a noble-spirited man comes to be what he is all at once; he must undertake hard winter training, and prepare himself, and not propel himself rashly into what is not appropriate to him'*

**- Epictetus**

The last exercise has been advised to us by Epictetus. It is called 'voluntary discomfort'. In this exercise, we are going to deliberately put ourselves through uncomfortable situations. We will do this in order to train ourselves to not hold onto comfort with such high regard.
We can perform voluntary discomfort in a number of ways.
Some suggestions are:

•	Cold Showers

•	NoFap

•	Exercising in the morning 

•	Walking in the cold without a jumper

•	Fasting for a day

•	Sleeping on the floor

All these things will change your relationship with comfort. Once you overcome the need for comfort, life will become much easier. Setting your goals and sticking to them will be far easier. When most people complain about being ‘uncomfortable’, you won’t be able to relate. You are literally training yourself to be like a Navy Seal. This method will harden you up for life.

 Eventually shit will hit the fan at some stage during your life. You want to have to mental and physical fortitude to weather the storm.

So those are the three stoic exercises. Stoicism is a practical philosophy that has survived the test of time due to its universal applications. If you practice these stoic meditations, you will be well on your way to the good life.

Often I see this guy there, we'll call him Brad. Brad's about 5'9, 28 years old, he's handsome— but only because he takes care of himself. He lifts, get's haircuts, he's in decent shape, lean. He has male friends, he does things, can hold a conversation and takes care of himself. Not a Chad by any stretch... but he's working on himself continuously.


Whenever we're playing basketball in the gym, I often witness Brad approach women charismatically and effortlessly. I've seen him cold approach 8's and 9's, convince them to watch him play basketball for 30 mins, then walk out of the gym with them after the game.


Today was different. I see Brad doing his thing as usual, shooting hoops and approaching women when the game dies down.


Brad see's this blonde HB9 and immediately B-lines to the locker (10 feet away from the court). Walks up to her and starts chatting with her. 2 mins pass, She's not feeling it, resting bitch face and giving him some dirty looks. He keeps at it... invites her to play basketball. She's still not feeling it.


Then about 15 seconds later, she turns her back to him without saying anything at all and gives him the most cold and unexpected *""slam the locker in your face""* rejections I've ever seen. It could have been out of high school musical.


I'll never forget what he said to her.


Just so she could hear him, he calmly — without chagrin, says **""your loss""**, as she walks away.


He picks up his ball, turns around, takes 2 steps and sinks a 3 from way downtown. Continues to play ball for the rest of the night, unfazed.


I commend Brad to get up after rejection like this. There was at least 15 men and women around him that saw exactly what happened. Most men would have social shame or at the very least some humiliation or discomfort. He didn't even flinch. Just turned around, says the truth, then shoots a 3.


We often talk back and forth about abundance mentality on TRP, but only in theory. Maybe some of us are like brad, but surely not all of us are. How many of us are practicing in real life situations like Brad? Who here would have even have approached an HB9 after her workout? I've never seen abundance mentality first hand like this in my life. This man didn't attach any of his value or worth to talking to this woman. He was simply a man who saw a woman he found attractive and approached her to see if she was also interested.


I know Brad personally, he's a great guy, and the words *""your loss""* is exactly the way to describe the how this woman should feel tonight.

I pulled away from the group and was going to go home, as I'd rather be alone than with shitty company, but a good friend of mine showed up and reminded me what good company is.

We left the bar and headed into town. We danced like fools at a dope club.

While dancing, a sexy brunette approached me and told me how much she loves my long hair. Not a few seconds later, her jealous friend came over and pulled her away. She stared at me as she left.

We hopped to a few other bars but I got bored, so we started walking home.

As we pass the last of the bars on the street, I see a cute brunette looking at me from her table. We lock eyes, I smile, and I keep walking.

She says something to me in Romanian. I stop and turn back to her. 

""Sorry, what? I don't speak Romanian.""

She smiles and says to me, ""I love your hair"" and reaches out. I step to her and let her feel my hair. I meet her and her cute blonde friend who ends up being her cousin. My buddy comes over and meets them.

After a few minutes of talking he moves to the table next to us and stays on his phone to avoid any awkward moments with the cousin who isn't into him. Amazing wingman. 

She's sitting on the chair while I'm crouched next to her, but my knees star to hurt. I tell her to stand up. She does, I take her seat, and then pull her onto my lap.

""Good girl. Sit in papi's lap.""

She smiles and asks me if I'm her papi. I tell her yes. I bring up sex and she tells me she's a virgin. I tell her that I'm going to be the one to take her virginity. She begs to differ.

She's 19 and been going out since she was 16. Given the empirical evidence (I have more evidence than her), these girls seem to be a bit more conservative than their Western counterparts, on average. 

I ask her why she's never had sex and she tells me she's never found anyone who was worth giving it to.

I tell her again that I'm going to be her first. She teases me again.I grab her face and kiss her. Her cousin is smiling. 

I push VERY hard to bring her home, but to no avail. Perhaps twenty or thirty minutes pass and I decide it's not going anywhere. She doesn't want to get pulled in front of her cousin.

I grab her number and text her.

__________________________________________

Silly bitch.

She comes over a few hours later. 

It takes me about 10 minutes to take her virginity. She even hands me the frame. She tells me how her cousin and her friends told her not to come over, and then when she was adamant, they told her not to do anything with me. I asked her if she's going to spend her whole life listening to what other people say she should do.

She gets quiet.

GG.

I take her clothes off and she asks me to be gentle, since she's new.

I am gentle....at first. I also confirm the virginity. Lots of blood. 

Our second round, I put this bitch's knees on her chest and piledrive her. It hurts her, but she enjoys it. She stares at my cock as it drives into her and I ask if she likes watching papi stretch her virgin pussy open. She tells me yes. 

I fuck her like four times. 

The next time I text her, I ask her to come over and she gives me shit about only wanting sex from her. I tell her that I like spending time with her. She continues to give me shit so I ignore her.

The next morning she texts me, ""Hi papi! :)""

Totally new attitude. We have a brief conversation, then I wait a day and text her ""hey baby.""

She comes over that night and we fuck again. This time, while hanging out, I tell her that her cousin is hot and that we should have a threesome. She gets mad.  

A few days later, she sends me a picture of her and her cousin licking ice cream. It's beyond suggestive. I give her some devil emojis and then ignore her next texts, because I felt like being an asshole for some reason. 

The next day, she sends me this

__________________________________________

Her - You really see just the slut in me, don't you?

Her - Well, I AM NOT YOUR FUCKING SLUT!

Her - So let's end whatever this is

__________________________________________

I try to calm her down but she keeps acting up.

Pimp hand ready.

__________________________________________

Me - Look, if you want to believe what you're thinking is true, then go ahead. It obviously doesn't matter what I say. I told you that I like you and enjoy spending time with you. I Also told you I can't promise anything more than that. I've been 100% honest from the start so I have nothing to justify and I don't have to defend myself. So if you don't want to see me anymore, then thats fine but don't accuse me or insinuate that I'm a bad person by giving me this attitude. I did nothing wrong.

___________________________________________

She apologizes and tells me that she thought she could handle a casual, sexual relationship but has feelings for me. I understand. I was her first.  

We end things on a high note.

A few months later, I randomly hit her up and she comes over that night. We fuck (and on one more occasion after that, before she leaves the country for an internship). 

She tells me how she still hasn't slept with anyone else. Maybe it's a lie. Maybe it's not.

Doesn't matter. 

I ask her why she hasn't fucked anyone else and she says all the other guys are boring. I ask her why she's with me then if she knows I won't date her (she's nice, cute, and fun to fuck, but I have other things in mind.)

She tells me it's still better than the other guys.",957,0,0.3021000027656555,"girl, feel, really, find, still, shit, male, always, leave, relationship",1

""I had always thought of woman as possessing those delicate qualities of mind and soul that made her in her respects far superior to man.
I had put her on a lofty pedestal, figuratively speaking, and ranked her in certain important attributes considerably higher than man.
I worshipped at the feet of the creature I had raised to this height, and, like every true worshiper, I felt myself unworthy of the object of my worship.

But all this was in the past. Now the soft voiced gentle woman of my reverent worship has all but vanished. In her place has come the woman who thinks that her chief success in life lies on making herself as much as possible like man - in dress, voice, and actions, in sports and achievements of every kind.
The world has experience many tragedies, but to my mind the greatest tragedy of all is the present economic condition wherein women strive against men, and in many cases actually succeed in usurping their places in the professions and in industry.
This growing tendency of women to overshadow the masculine is a sign of a deteriorating civilization. 

Practically all the great achievements of man until now have been inspired by his love and devotion to woman. Man has aspired to great things because some woman believed in him, because he wished to command her admiration and respect. For these reasons he has fought for her and risked his life and his all for her time and time again.

Perhaps the male in society is useless. I am frank to admit that I don't know. If women are beginning to feel this way about it - and there is striking evidence at hand that they do - then we are entering upon the cruelest period of the world's history.

Our civilization will sink to a state like that which is found among the bees, ants, and other insects - a state wherein the male is ruthlessly killed off. In this matriarchal empire which will be established, the female rules. As the female predominates, the males are at her mercy. The male is considered important only as a factor in the general scheme of the continuity of life.

The tendency of women to push aside man, supplanting the old spirit of cooperation with him in all the affairs of life, is very disappointing to me.""",1006,4,0.4408000111579895,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first",1

Second of all, this post is not racist and is not about white supremacy or some shit, I don’t give a shit about your race. I care if you are a civilized man or not.

Today I was taking a ride on the subway to go meet my friend and business partner for a drink, and I was carrying a bottle of whiskey(not something very expansive, but not something cheap either).

After I reached my stations, I had to go through a tunnel to get to the restaurant. During my entire walk through the tunnel there was a group of 4 men(ages 18-20) from an ethnic minority who were acting all gangsta and “thug life”, screaming, smelling, pushing each other, walking on the wrong side of the tunnel to bump into people walking in opposite direction, and disturbing pretty much everyone around them( btw, at that hour the subway is full, as was the tunnel), and nobody was saying anything about that( me included, as I was trying to ignore them).

At the end of the tunnel, there is an escalator, and this dudes where right in front of me, pushing each other and acting like monkeys, until two of them fell, right at the end of the escalator. I was about to trip on them… and in that moment I had enough. After I avoided tripping, I was so angry on the situation that I hit one of the dudes on the floor with my foot and started swearing and screaming at them. 

All the people around me were stunned. The other 3 dudes from the “gang” included.
And after that I was amazed by what happened. The guy on the floor who was so gangsta for the last minutes started crying and apologizing while the other dude who was down quickly run away. Meanwhile the oldest dude from the group(about 20 years old) was coming towards me all angry and shit. I just looked at him, opened my arms, with the bottle in one hand, and shout “Try me motherfucker, let’s see what happens”. He stopped coming towards me. What do you think he did after that? He started shouting that I was aggressing them, that I was a racist and a Nazi( well, I called them parasites,  because they are). Suddenly, the gangsta guys turned themselves in the victims. 

The security came immediately( the guard was from the same minority) and aligned with them as they said that I attacked them, and he(the guard) said that he would call the police. What did I do? I said: “Do it fucker, you will lose your shitty job after that.”. All that while I was having my killer face on. I wasn’t talking shit. I knew I had the power to make him lose his job if I wanted. I was pissed off. I was confident. I was ready to fight them all because I had enough with their bullshit. The guard and the 4 gangsta dude where all in shook. Especially as I was so pissed off that I even took the Nazi role that they gave me and started talking about killing them and their families because they were parasites.  I even invoked a historical figure from my country that murdered some of them while he was in charge(not Hitler, I’m not german).
And after that, something I didn’t expected happened. The people around us, who just stayed silent and stunned till then, started speaking. And guess what? They took my side. All of them. The first to speak was a lady(around 40 years old), then an old man, and after that everybody started screaming at them. And in that moment the security guard took away the 4 gangsta boys. 

After that I went to the restaurant and think about what happened.

I just applied the Sun Tzu’s Art of War without even realizing it. If you read something and meditated about it, you will apply it without even realizing it. Let me give some examples:

1: “Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak.”
I’m 19 years old and I have an athletic physique even though I’m not all muscle and I can’t say that I’m a good fighter since I’ve never done MMA or something like that. I’m pretty sure there is a 75% that the 4 gangsta dudes could have beaten me up. But I didn’t back down, I hold my frame and I was the first to strike. The dudes got intimidated. They imagined that if I’m so confident probably I’m some Conor McGregor or something. Even though I was outnumbered and “outgunned” I acted strong and they backed down and turned themselves from the though gangsta guys to the poor minority victims.

2: “The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.”
This is the most important thing in life. You must win you wars without a fight. As I did. If I fought I would have probably been defeated and badly injured. Instead I won without a fight.

3: “If the mind is willing, the flesh could go on and on without many things.” 
If your mind is strong you can surpass your physical limitations. If I thought about my physical power I would have remained a beta who runs away from danger.

4: “The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.”
Do I need to say more?

I could go on and on, but I recommend you to read Sun Tzu’s book.

Now, as I said in title, this is a clear case where frame helped me emerge victorious from a confrontation even without a fight. I acted as an alpha. I knew I’m superior to them and they, in their subconscious knew it. I knew I was going to a good restaurant while they where going to their shitty homes. I was superior to them from every point, even though they where stronger physically than me, psychically I have won the battle. I simply couldn’t stand being humiliated by monkeys who are basically just parasites to our society. Why should someone like me(someone who has his own software company and is kind of successful for his age) accept such a disgraceful display in front of his eyes? Why should the civilized man subdue to the barbarians? Just ask yourself this questions.

And now, in the end, what I learned about our society from this?
Simply: the vocal minorities(not necessarily ethnic minorities) have the power just because they are the loudest in the room, while the majority stay silent out of fear( either fear of getting hurt or fear of being called a racist/homophobe/misogynist), but at the moment a man from the majority took action against the minority, at the moment someone had the guts to do what everyone else would have wished to do… at that very moment, the majority’s power was unlashed. They didn’t care about things like being called a “nazi” or shit like that. They expressed their anger. They where happy that they were finally able to say what they where thinking. They transformed from a scared silent flock of sheep to an angry mob in under 2 minutes. That's the power of example. Our society just needs more examples of strong men to heal itself from the shit that it have become.

Now, I think you all will be able to draw your own conclusions from this. 

Being alpha is not about just banging a new bitch every night. Being alpha is about taking a stand and be a leader for your pack. Be like the lion who is protecting his property from hyenas . Be like the wolf who is leading his pack through winter. Take a stand. Take risks. Don’t avoid the danger.

I have been in the game or ""red-pilled"" for 8 years now.

I was a virgin going into college and read ""the game"" and a ebook about college game on the internet. Forget the name. 

Anyways I got laid here and there but struggled with women throughout college and was generally awkward and socially unaware. 

I think the turning point for me was about a year after college, since then I've slept with over 100 women some were gorgeous and some were complete dogs and I don't say that lightly. Had a few relationships along the way as well. 

Anyways, enough about me - here are some simple tips I think would help out a lot of you in there. 

1. Women are not inherently evil. It's not their fault.

They are fundamentally different than us. Their brain has a different chemistry, and it's not their fault. They are the more vulnerable sex, and their brains have evolved to maximize their ability to survive and reproduce. 

They will always look for a man who provides them with status, safety, and security, while secretly or overtly desiring the alpha male - I don't think I need to explain what an alpha male is on here. 

There will always be someone better looking, braver, manlier, more successful, wealthier, or better looking than you. Accept that if your wife or girlfriend encounters this man she will be extremely attracted and her instincts will scream at her to sleep with him. 

Once you accept this fact, and come to peace with it - you will have a much healthier appreciation for women and most importantly an inner peace. 

2. Every woman is different, Every woman is the same.

Don't treat a girl like a robot. They are human beings. They are extremely different in their interests, goals, passions, desires, idiosyncrasies, etc. 

However, much like we are all attracted to a beautiful face with perky tits, a tight ass, and a nice body (for the most part), just about every girl craves an alpha male, whether they admit it or not. 

From the moment you first lock eyes she is testing you. 

If you think you have her in the bag and let your guard down, she will notice, and will treat you accordingly. 

""The game"" is never over, it's always on. Women constantly test us to figure out who we really are, in order to differentiate the real you from the person you outwardly present yourself to be. 

Even after you have proven yourself to her, she will constantly ""test"" you to make sure you are still that guy, and haven't lost your edge. (This applies more to long-term relationships than one night stands)

3. Judge her by her actions, not her words

Do not hold a woman to the same level of honor as a man and do not expect her to keep her word. A woman lives and dies by her emotions. She may say ""I love you"" on Tuesday, and feel completely different on Saturday night, depending on your behavior and her emotional state. 

Take what she says with caution, many times she is simply trying to illicit a response or manipulating you into doing something that is favorable to her and detrimental to you. 

Women are masters of emotion. If you succumb or react to her getting angry, upset, or vindictive, she will subconsciously sense weakness and question your ability to provide for and protect her. Remember, this is not her fault, she is usually not consciously aware or trying to do this to you, it's merely instinct. 

4. Do not swim against the tide. 

Make things as easy as possible for yourself. It is true that there are exceptions to the rule, however why make success with women an uphill battle, sport, or egotistical endeavor?

If you are 5'4 you will be most successful with shorter women. 

If you are just starting out and don't have much experience, go for the cute girl taking shots with her friends at the edge of the bar instead of the supermodel sitting with her posse in bottle service. 

6's and 7's can often be a lot more fun to hang out with and sleep with than perfect 10's. In fact, they usually are. The hottest girls are often not worth the headache. 

Have good grooming, work out, dress nice, and take pride in your appearance. There is such a thing as trying too hard, and I think we all know what that looks like, don't be that guy. On the flipside, there are plenty of out of shape assholes who smell like whiskey and dress like shit - and still get laid, but the chances are if you are reading this you are probably not that guy. 

Try to drive a nice car, have a nice place and have a decent job - that doesn't mean you should flaunt it or use it as a bargaining chip. Honestly you should do that for yourself, but of course it improves your attractiveness.

5. Play the numbers game

The more girls you talk to and date the less you will be concerned about each individual reaction and the girl will absolutely pick up on it. 

Remember, our natural instinct is to sleep with as many girls as possible in order to create as many offspring as possible. If you are attempting to hide, apologize for, or suppress your natural feelings as a man she will sense that you are not a sexually fit man and that you will sacrifice your dignity and resources in order to date and have a chance to reproduce with her. Again subconscious and not her fault. 

When you are single, always keep a dialog with multiple women, and when in a relationship make sure to constantly talk to and surround yourself with attractive women. Never let a girl feel that she is your only option and that you are desperate to keep her...once she feels that she controls the relationship she will start treating you differently, attraction will fade, and she will leave you at the first opportunity.

6. Girls just want to have fun

Of course there are exceptions, but the average girl just wants to feel safe, be taken care of, and have fun. 

If you take dating too seriously or give the impression of actively focusing on your dating life, it will signal a lack of options and a sense of desperation. Take what comes to you, you don't need to sleep with every girl on the first date, you are allowed to be yourself, and not every girl is going to like you, whether you like it or not and no matter how good your game is. 

Just some practical advice I've gained over the years through successes, painful experiences, and plenty of trial and error. 

One last thing, no one's perfect. If you slip up don't freak out - girls realize that we all make mistakes and no one is perfect. They care more about who you are inside over the long run. They will look over a occasional breakdown or episode here or there if you are a quality guy. 

P.S. One more thing. You don't have to have a pornstar dick to please a woman. But learn how to do it right and drive her crazy. She will keep coming back for more. Unfortunately there is no substitution for practice. A steady girlfriend is not the worst thing ever.",1003,4,0.3630000054836273,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first",1

I get salty because he was supposed to invite our bro instead. Karma gets him back and I end up sleeping with her instead despite having no intention of doing so.

## Story

A large festival just finished this weekend in my city and I had a great time. Cool music, incredible art, and good vibes all around. Sorry for the length but I'm cross-posting this to a FB group so I wanna make sure those guys get the full story haha.

### Saturday

Saturday night I went with my best friend and one of his plates. He wanted to see some bands I didn't care about so I spent that whole night solo.

Wasn't trying to hook up with anyone, just wanted to enjoy the music and take in the atmosphere. Still, some girls were really digging my trippy glasses and I realized they'd be a great way to open girls and dance with them.

I ended up dancing with two smokeshows that night but couldn't make out with either of them. First one was really touchy so I thought she was into me but she wasn't feeling anything but dancing. Her friend was a lot more receptive but I missed my chance to try with her before they left. The other one just took my glasses and started dancing with me but she was also not into making out.

I can't really pinpoint where I fucked up but I didn't end up with anyone that night. It could've been that both girls had friends with them so maybe they didn't wanna leave their friends hanging or something. I even did the ""do you mind if I dance with your friend?"" line to involve the friends but I guess it didn't help.

Don't really care, still had a fun night regardless.

### Sunday

Sunday afternoon my best friend has an extra ticket since his plate couldn't go, so I tell him to invite one of our bros. I call our bro up and say we got tickets for him and he's super stoked to come with. Not even a minute after hanging up, my best friend says one of his buddies set him up with a girl, talking him up and everything, and to definitely invite her out with the extra ticket.

He calls our bro to give him the bad news and I get salty since now I look bad for calling him up just to cancel 2 minutes later. Still, I'm not gonna stay butt hurt about it so I just roll with it.

He leaves to pick up this girl and comes back a bit later. They both drop acid before we head out to grab some food at a local spot and here's where I start fucking up as a wingman. I'm in a no-fucks-given mood so I'm teasing the hell out of this girl, treating her like a child because she says a lot of stupid shit, but I'm also talking up my best friend and referencing some of the cool art stuff he does.

I'm a master of bullshitting and talking about literally anything so I start talking about ghosts with this girl and my bro and she's indulging me in my bullshit. Unfortunately I end up vibing more with the girl than my bro was so I pull my banter back a bit and let my bro kino to build rapport with her.

When we show up at the festival we go to the bathrooms and my friend goes ""I think you had that girl at the ghosts shit. Wouldn't be surprised if she ends up with you instead tonight."" I tell him I'm literally not even trying to do anything, I'm just being me and not paying any attention to her at all ... And then he says this girl apparently loves being treated like that. Oops.

I don't wanna cockblock my bro so I keep my distance and dance by myself for like an hour while I'm assuming he's trying to kino with her. After the artist's set, we walk to another stage and he says she's on her phone and not reciprocating to his kino at all.

To top it off ... This girl then says she wants to meet up with her _guy friend she met at another festival_ and tells us to come with her. My buddy was not having any of this so he keeps his frame and says ""no, we're gonna go watch [artist], you can come with us or go find your friend by yourself."" She didn't follow so my buddy says fuck it, we're still gonna have a great night.

We meet up with some of my fraternity brothers and have some fun dancing to some bangers. After an hour this girl texts my buddy asking where we are and where to meet her. At this point I'm sure they're both tripping hard on the acid so he goes to look for her to make sure she's okay. He doesn't find her so she texts me to come get her but I tell her I'm enjoying the set and she'll have to wait until it's done.

After the set she didn't text back when I asked where she was so I find my bro instead. We wanna find this girl since he feels responsible for her but she's not picking up or answering texts. I'm completely sober by this point but we find a friend who has Molly, so I say fuck it and take some.

We go to this LED blanket thing and the Molly hits me hard laying on the ground looking up at this thing. We see a group of hotties that are also tripping so we lay with them and let them try out the trippy glasses. I kiss one of the girls before they leave but now I wanna go see one of my favorite artists while I'm rolling that hard.

My bro didn't wanna go so I decided to go by myself to see the set. It was a great fucking experience while on Molly. Midway through the set I get a text from the girl saying to meet up at a landmark when the set is done. I tell her alright and continue having fun.

After the set I go find her and I have the sternest look on my face. She's happy I found her but I'm having none of that and go straight patriarch on her. I grab her face with my hands and scold her for running off on her own, straight up treating her like a child and saying she's gonna get punished for misbehaving. I see she's actually digging the scolding and grabs my face as well while smiling.

At this point I'm salty but I also feel great thanks to the Molly so I just start making out with her, periodically slapping her face saying I can't believe what a dumb bitch she is and telling her to tell me she's a dumb bitch. She eats it up.

I tell her we gotta find my buddy so we go walk to find him and she's all over me. We show up and she's holding my hand and my best friend has the most ""you gotta be shitting me"" look on his face hahahahaha. I tell him I'm sorry but the girl wasn't feeling him so I just stepped in. We end up walking to an after party where I kino this girl even more until we leave at 5am. We end up back at my buddy's but we're all still high so we watch a movie while we wait to come down.

I go use the bathroom real quick and come back to see my bro next to this girl hella cockblocking me (you fucker). I'm just thinking ""this motherfucker still hasn't given up!"" but I can tell she's not digging it and by this point I just wanna hate fuck this girl for what she pulled.

I say I'm gonna go home and sleep in my comfy bed and ask this girl to come with. She says yes and the rest is history.

## Final Thoughts

Suggestion to my bro since I know you're gonna read this: apparently you were too touchy with her when you met her and that kinda put her off a bit. I also noticed you came off with some scarcity body language since you didn't get to bang your plate the night before and you were really trying to get laid. Don't know if it was the acid but that's not usually how you are, was a little surprised by your actions and behaviors in some cases.

In any case, I didn't really do anything special here. I was just being myself, but this is now my default persona after 4 years of being exposed to TRP. I gave this girl no validation, treated her like a child, and she bent to my frame. Unlike my friend I also experienced no shit tests and no LMR whatsoever. I can tell she's a massive sloot ... But she does have hot friends so I might plate her to get access to her friends.

My first thought. If all women are whores for you. That must be a good thing right? So why the anger? 

...oh because they are not YOUR whores. If they were there would be no issue. 

Most of you who have internalized the sidebar understand that it’s just our turn. They can never be our whores. So the only reason that can upset you is because of the ego. 

But there’s more to this. The problem isn’t them being whores. Because in reality. They are not all whores (at least not as the post read.) They are just AWALT. 

The problem is YOU. You’re calling her a whore because she left you to go fuck someone else. That’s not the issue though. She did it for a reason and the reasons are usually one or more of the 3. 

1. Your value/status sucks. 
2. Your  frame sucks. 
3  Your Attitude/life sucks.

**Value**

If you are a top tier male most women are not going to do anything to fuck up and potentially lose you. When I date women they tip toe when making a questionable decision. They make sure before they do something it’s not going to piss me off. Why? Because most guys fucking suck. Honestly. It’s laughable how little the competition is. They’re all out of shape. They haven’t heard of the word game besides talking about halo and world of war craft. Frame doesn’t even make sense to them. They dress like shit , Orbiting is a hobby, and needy as fuck, my god these dudes are so fucking needy (I hear women constantly complain about it). So as long as you form your life around the principles in the sidebar (that you see fitting for your mission) you’re way ahead of the game. 

If these women are doing things to piss you off so easily it’s a good indication your value or status is shitty and you have work to do. Because I’m telling you. If you are in decent shape. Have a purpose in life. Maximize your attraction. And know game. MOST women have never experienced a guy like you. They usually don’t want to fuck that up especially if they have been in past relationships that were shit. That doesn’t mean they never will but again if you’re a man of value you will have no issue creating a boundary or stopping that shit dead in its tracks. 

They are never going to be the ones giving YOU an ultimatum. If your given an ultimatum. She’s subtly telling you. Your value is shit. Take it as a blessing and lesson learned. Say goodbye and get back to the drawing boards. (Aka working on yourself.)

**Frame**

Your frame sucks. You care too much. You’re overly invested. She knows. You know it. We know it. Everyone knows it. If you were to take full responsibility for everything in your life. You’d never have the nerve to call her a whore out of frustration because you realize she’s just a women being a woman and you’re the reason this behavior took place. 

Now I know someone’s going to say even the best of the best get cheated on sometimes. And yes it does happen but usually they are missing something. Or did something for it to happen. In the rare occasion she cheats on a high value man who has all his shit together. they aren’t wasting a fucking second crying, moaning, or ridiculing the women for it. They are already on to the next one. 

All women are like that. They all have women instinct. They can and may cheat. We are aware of it but we don’t need to live in paranoia because of it. If you have your shit together like I said above it’s unlikely she’s going to jump on the next better dick and fuck things up with you. Especially if she knows you’ll leave Or you have created firm boundaries. 

**Attitude/life**

If you’re going around calling women whores. It’s a good indication your attitude sucks. You’re like the girl who whines about her ex to the new dude she’s dating. The guy she’s cheating on you with or “whoring” herself with is usually fun as fuck. Carefree. Living life by his own rules. Showing her a time she’s never had before. 

I have alpha widowed almost every girl I have been with (I know this sounds concede . But I’d like to give some personal examples). This is because I am a fun mother fucker. I always try to live that way. I don’t like rules. I used to get into a lot of trouble. I was wild. I’ve matured over the years to keep myself out of trouble but I’m still wild at heart. 

I take the women I meet to shoot guns they will never get to touch again in their lives. I show up randomly at their house at 2 am to fuck their brains out. I call them tell them get ready we’re going to have some fun. I take them to abandon places to explore then fuck them in them. I fuck them in their cars. In parking lots. On roofs. In playgrounds. Hang cuff Them while fucking them. Where ever/however I can that no other guy would ever think of doing. 

I do shit that makes them nervous as fuck. All the while I stay calm and laugh. Sneak into places you shouldn’t be. Sneak into movies. Sneak into their rents house. Fuck her in the bathroom at the grocery store. The dressing room at the mall. You name it I’ve tried it. 

Now think about that. If you’re a guy doing all this shit. HOW in the fuck is she ever going to replace your crazy ass. She can try. But like I said if she’s been with some shitty guys she’s going to be blown the fuck away. Not even chad can get her to cheat. And if she does. I mean honestly at this point you won’t care. You’ll have an abundance mentality thats untouchable. 

The key is to always be having fun with a dgaf attitude towards anything that isn’t helping you get to where you  want to be. Get out of your comfort zone. Experience new shit and be happy you’re able too. Make your life as interesting as possible and you won’t have time to waste worrying about people who bring negativity into your life. 

Life’s too short to call women whores. Life’s too short to even care. You’re Attitude should be. Fun. Free. Fuck it! 

TL:DR women aren’t whores. Unless you’re the high value fun guy. Otherwise Women are just women. It’s YOU that sucks. Not her. Fix yourself.

Although I am learning every single day I feel like since turning this age my outlook and opinions have dramatically changed. I want to offer these as I go along:

**Chasing Women is a waste of time** Luckily Tinder etc is the norm. Women do not disappear they are always there. Always. If desperate for a bang, drop your standards. But do not under any circumstances focus on it. Yes I got laid a lot, not as much as I wanted to however they are memories you share with your buddies over a beer, and they make you smile for about 1 minute. Thats it. But what I will say is get it out of your system. Fuck around, fuck an asian girl. Fuck a spanish one. Have a ONS. Do it, enjoy it. Then you'll know when you don't have the energy for it anymore that its out of your system unlike the beta that settles for any thing, and you can chill with a respectable LTR. 

**Lack of Goals = Lack of Improvement** WRITE YOUR GOALS DOWN. All of them, and set yourself realistic targets. Do not just say ""I want to lose weight"" say ""i want to lose 5kg in 2 months. Those who do not have clearly defined goals are wandering lost souls. Write your goals down, and stick to them. This will bring you greater pleasure then getting laid a lot trust me. Do not be a male bimbo.

**Going out every weekend** Biggest waste of money, time, energy and so on. I have stayed in on weekends for last 2 years half of it single and had the time of my life. Maybe cos Im 30 but seriously I do not recall one night that was ""life changing"" and so on. Its a load of shit and in the antisocial socialist heavy society we live in most people are insecure assholes in bars etc. So really think about it, on your days off/weekends why would you choose to go to a place full of people that are a bunch of cunts? Go to dinner, get a hobby, improve yourself, work on a project, even play a video game that you can improve on. Going out is finished. Again nobody on their deathbed ever remembers the night they go to the bar full of average to sexy looking women who were rude or might have fucked you. 

**Invest** Real estate, shares, anything that produces income. Do not invest in something that gives you no dividends. Its a load of bullshit.

**There will always be another job, but not another life** If you need income, work, but if you want to be successful work for yourself. I realised at 23 that my bosses at all my jobs were no smarter than me, and I refused to ever work for another incompetent asshole again. Funnily enough 7 years later each one of those bosses have either been fired, company closed or quit. You got one life, do whatever the fuck you want on YOUR terms.

**Do not go to College* Unless you are studying law or medicine, DO NOT BOTHER. Do not get yourself into THOUSANDS of debt, for a piece of paper. Im a college dropout, zero debt, worked for myself, whereas others I know cant even fucking go out as they are crippled with student loans. Do not do it, youre only doing it for the social life, and again thats a bubble not worth staying in for that amount of debt.

**Friends come and go** Seriously the friends I have now to before are chalk and cheese. If you dont like a dude, do not hang out with them. Also like to add, do not socialise with women. They are at their worst right now and are selfish beyond belief. Those who are lucky to use them to get laid etc well done, but majority of us have never been so fortunate. They offer you nothing good at all and I havent had a female friend (that i wasnt banging) for 3 years. Couldnt be happier.

**Assume bullshit** I believed everything I was ever told. We live in a bullshit heavy society. Do not believe a single word. None of it. Whether its in business or socially. Assume bollocks, smile, nod and don't give a fuck.

**Its easier to make money for yourself then ever** A guy I know had no money, no prospects got a business loan and paid it off in 13 months selling fucking burgers for a stand and is looking to expand. Seriously, take the hit, totally worth it.

**Get dumped/Break up** Greatest life lesson ever. Best painful experience too. If you've never had this, you've never lived.

**Delete all social media** Biggest waste of time ever, use it ONLY for trying to bang a girl or promote your business. Anything beyond that do not bother.

**Take the risk** Invest the money, ask her out, do something stupid, put a lot on red, but all within minimum. Ive gone extreme on all this, I've lost a lot of money, Ive done plenty stupid things, i put a lot on red and black came up. Don't regret any of it, lifes too short. But be warned do not overstretch yourself. Dont put it ALL on red, eggs in one basket and so on.

Last but not least **Do whatever YOU want** Your family, friends, spouse, teachers, boss do not know you. They think they do, but they are fucking stupid. You know you, and only you can do what you think is right. Trust your heart, but not what you think your dad would like etc. I'm telling you to be selfish because its not their lives its YOUR lives. 

You can honestly achieve anything in your lives. Seriously, the amount of shit wankers told me and I proved them all wrong is the greatest feeling ever.

Put simply you've been lied to, and odds are you've been subjected to a [Poisoning the Well logical fallacy](https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/140/Poisoning-the-Well) and a poorly crafted [Straw Man Fallacy](http://www.logicalfallacies.info/ambiguity/straw-man/). 

My personal thinking is that the creators of the CNN report that lead you here are guilty of plain old fashioned [Yellow Journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism). They tried to create a hit piece on us, and the manosphere in general, and have failed spectacularly. Besides, why would CNN care about little old us? What useful purpose could they have for targeting us? We're just a subreddit like the message boards of old. 

The truth is that our message resonates with millions of men and women because we cut the crap and speak plainly about dating, relationships, and the forces at play in our so called ""battle of the sexes"". Sometimes this ruffles  feathers, but our tone doesn't make our message untrue. Notice they always attack the tone and never the message itself. If they did they'd be putting a spotlight on how fraudulent the blue pill really is, and that would threaten the status quo. We can't have none of that, no sir!

My immediate response to them has now become what I put in the title of this post.


I go to a gym with about 3000 members, probably the biggest one in my city. This particular gym has this stigma for being roid central, as it houses quite a few pro bodybuilders and high end Instagram models, mixed with power-lifters who've been pumping iron since they could walk. Stepping foot inside the building can be a very daunting thing for newcomers as they feel they're immediately placed at the bottom of the ladder. 


Here's the thing though, something that is one of my favorite aspects of joining a gym. Despite what is taught outside the gym walls, once you walk inside, 99.9% of the time ***no one could care less*** about your size, muscle build, appearance, or the level of progress you are at. The only people that will give a shit about you are personal trainers, and that's only because they're paid to. In fact, the only point where most regulars would acknowledge your existence would be their first glance at you, and most of the the time this will consist of them thinking *""Good for them, good to see people trying to improve themselves,""* before they get back to whatever they were training.


Remember, everyone in a gym shares a common goal: to improve *their* fitness. Most are too focused on this goal to even consider for two seconds if you are sharing that goal with them.

Let me tell you, a lot of men these days are straight up gay, really. They suck this world's dick & swallow, when it should be the other way arround. You're a slave to the situation and have the emotional strength/stability of a bitch on her cycle. Here's a key ability that a lot of us are missing today.

* Suffer In Silence

I know I always got pissed off when my father told me this. I'd fall out of a tree and get the wind knocked out of me,  ""suffer in silence"" is what I got.
My girlfriend cheats on me and goes with another man ""suffer in silence"". I have to a lot of chores to do that will take all fucking day, ""suffer in silence"". I'm about to get my ass whipped for setting stuff on fire when I was told not to, ""Turn around and suffer in silence"". I didn't know until now that I was being groomed into an emotional stronghouse.

The very act of complaining or telling someone your problems is weakness, for the mere fact that you're trying to let someone else hold the emotional burden you have. That's all complaining is, a cry for help or relief from an outside source other than yourself.

Suffering in Silence goes hand in hand with being tough. It's being strong for others in the midst of soul crippling pain. It's carrying your own weight and getting the job done.

Men are productive & logical  (At least a few of you still are) and we shouldn't have time for things that are counterproductive like complaining/crying. It gets nothing done, it solves no problem. Complaining is what women do, because most the time they don't have the physical capability to get shit done themselves. 
 
To sum this up, here's one of the greatest quotes from TWD for yall to keep in mind.

""If you have to eat shit, best not to nibble. 'Bite, chew, swallow, repeat. goes quicker.""

The Feynman Technique is a method of learning that is incredibly effective for deep understanding and information retention. How many time have you learned something fast only to forget how to do it weeks later? Maybe it was the Pythagoras theorem, back in high school when you crammed for your math exam. Now when you friend asks you to recite it, all you can do is shrug and say 

***“What the fuck is that? A Harry Potter spell?”***

The problem was that you never learned the thing properly, you simply stored it in the temporary storage section of your brain. This is how many people go about learning, reciting things only to forget them later. 
There is a big difference between knowledge and wisdom, knowledge is having the information, wisdom is knowing how to use it. 

The Feynman Technique is a mental model that will help you gain sufficient wisdom in any endeavour. 
Richard Feynman was a Noble Prize-winning theoretical physicist who was best known for his work in the fields of quantum mechanics, quantum electrodynamics, superfluidity and other groovy shit. To say the least his was a smart dude, he was often called the ‘Great Explainer’ for his uncanny ability to teach complicated principles in layman terms that everybody could understand. 
  Feynman claims that he wasn’t a naturally gifted physicist but managed to make it due to his learning style and hard work. Here is his notorious method for accelerated understanding. 

##**Step One:**

Write the name of a concept that you want to learn about on top of a blank piece of paper. 

##**Step Two:**

Write down an explanation of the concept using plain English. Pretend that you trying to teach it to the slowest person you know or a child. Assume the person has no idea what the hell you are talking about so make sure you cover everything you know simply. 

##**Step Three:**
 
Read over your explanation and take note of the areas in which you are lacking the sufficient knowledge in order to articulate yourself properly. Take note of these areas and return to your source material until you have a better understanding Use a variety of materials: YouTube videos, books, and experts. Return to step two and simplify further.

**Note: When you simply you are cutting out the slack, do not remove things that are important for understanding whatever you trying to learn. You are simply trying to be more concise.**

##**Step Four:**

Use the aid of simple analogies, diagrams, metaphors and anything else that can help you commit what you have learned to memory. Come at it from different angles to gain a deeper understanding of the topics.
Einstein is often attributed to saying:

***“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough”***

The Feynman Technique will ensure that you understand any subject incredibly well. 

##**What Can You Learn Using The Method?**

To put it simply you can learn anything with the method from:

* Computer Programming 
* Calculus 
* Physics
* Economics 
* Chemistry 
* Mathematics

Anything at all! You might have to modify the method slightly for some disciplines but the main underlying principle is what makes the method so effective. 


##**WHY IT WORKS:**

The Feynman Technique works for many reasons. Often when we are trying to learn new concepts we erroneously assume that we have learned them and understood them when in actuality we haven’t fully grasped the concepts. 

Feynman once said:

***“The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.”***

This is the first and most critical mistake that many make when trying to learn new things. Writing what you know and trying to simplify it exposes your gaps in understanding. 

The second reason it works is through the beauty of neural connections. Think back to 2 weeks ago when you went grocery shopping. Can you remember what you bought or what happened at the shops? Most likely not, your brain does not put much stock into the mundane. Now let’s assume 2 weeks ago you were shopping and you saw three firefighters running towards to deli section. Now that’s a memory you won’t forget, you might remember it for the rest of your life because it was out of the ordinary. 

The strongest neural connections are always formed with things that are out of the ordinary. This is why you can remember what you were doing when you heard about 9/11 or can vividly recall your first kiss.
Now when you are learning and are up to step 4. You are forced to come up with analogies and metaphors to help you understand concepts. This simple process is out of the ordinary and allows your brain to have more stimulus to work with, more checkpoints to return to when you trying to recall a piece of information. 
So that’s the Feynman Method, for overrun and an actual real-time example, make sure to check out my animated video here:

One of my direct reports has been taking advantage of this (even before I came into this role) to basically create a Smurfette effect. She was the second draft pick for the position I got moved into and only lost by a hair. Keep in mind that this is after I saved the company from a coworker's substantial fuckup and demonstrated competence. Meanwhile she's mediocre at her job at best. Crazy to see how far titties can get you. We'll call this woman Susan.

Needless to say she resents the fuck out of me. Thinks my job should be hers and even mentioned such to a former coworker and close friend of mine. Loose lips sink ships, right? She turned up her flirtatiousness ever since, specifically targeting my superior (who is on the executive management team). He's been falling for it hook, line, and sinker. He regards flirting with attractive females as a privilege of rank from what I can tell and, at one point, even had a ""talking to"" with me (doubtless prompted by this bitch) about her feelings and to be nice and blah blah blah.

Naturally, I decided about ten seconds into this conversation that her name should be taken off my phone directory and put onto an unemployment check.

I fabricated a line of analytical reasoning as to why a problem that had existed in the inventory systems of a foreign office (we'll say the German office) had to be addressed now. Someone would have to go to ""Germany"" for about three months (give or take) to fix it. My presence was required here to finish rolling out something that was mid-implementation. So Susan was the only option. Boss man was visibly upset. This was his spank tank material after all. Susan was thrilled. She ""Always loves to travel!""

Unfortunately for Susan, the work waiting for her in ""Germany"" was some of the shittiest, most grueling work in existence. And there was no way to avoid it without it being obvious that she had shirked. So she had to do it. That's irrelevant, but it helped me get through those months knowing that she was miserable.

As soon as she left, I set about finding ""temporary"" help as a replacement. This had been discussed as part of the plan. I quickly found a more than suitable candidate. She was perfect. She was younger than Susan. She was meek and compliant whereas Susan had been boisterous and dominant. She was humble. Most importantly, she was Asian. We will call her Hijun. I told her that the job was temp-to-perm. In a way this was dishonest. But, ultimately, it *was* truthful!

My boss, I knew for a fact, had a thing for Asians. He took to Hijun immediately. Like cancer takes to a prostate. And it just so happened that she was a very, *very* diligent employee as well. Her metrics were far better than Susan's ever were. I took note to mention her success publicly and praise her multiple times.

Fast forward three months and I call Hijun over after making sure Bossman is in his office (which is well within earshot). I tell her, quietly, that the three month period of her employment is ending because the person she replaced is due to come back from ""Germany"" in a week or two (Susan's project ran late because obviously it did). She doesn't understand. I said temp-to-perm, didn't I? Fortunately, I've nailed the ""earnest and surprised"" look. She begins to cry and I offer her a tissue.

On cue, bossman comes over and asks what's going on.

""Well, as you know, Susan is coming back and will be able to resume her duties... So...""

""Oh, right."" I can tell now that Susan had honestly slipped his mind after three months. He seems genuinely torn.

""Unfortunately, it seems there may have been some sort of... language barrier or miscommunication? Hijun was under the impression this would be permanent.""

""Oh, Jeese. That stinks."" Hamster spinning. ""But didn't you say that her numbers have been really good?""

I nod. Hijun is not crying but is still clearly distraught and sniffling. ""That's true. All of her metrics have been stellar. But unfortunately there's not enough work here for two positions.""

""Yeah... there must be something we can do, though.""

He wants an excuse at this point. I have one.

""Well, aren't they still looking to fill that position in accounts payable? Susan had a minor in accounting.""

This position has been filled and vacant on and off for years. Because the manager is an idiot who doesn't know what she wants. This position is a metaphorical toilet with the flushing power of Niagara falls that can dispose of even the largest pieces of human refuse. Namely, Susan. What's more, it is in an entirely different department. But big dick bossman can get her placed there if he wants.

""Hey! That's right!"" Ignores me, immediately turns to Hijun and begins to comfort her. ""Don't worry, Hijun. We've got it. You'll stay on and become permanent in this role and Susan will take a *different* role in the company. Okay?""

She's obviously still broken up a bit, but hopeful. She nods. His white knighting over, he turns back to me to deal with the reality of the decision he's just made. ""Is she still up, you think?""

""Well, it should be 3:40 in 'Germany' now. Do you want me to ask her if this is okay?""

""I'll tell her."" Bossman exits stage left. I let Hijun regain her composure, apologized for the confusion, and made sure to have her made permanent before Susan was back on the same continent. Susan is currently battling the atomic water pressure of the Accounts Payable toilet, Hijun is performing better than ever (she still thanks me sometimes), and bossman can jack off to this nice girl who is not qualified for and has no interest in my position.",1036,0,0.24240000545978546,"girl, feel, really, find, still, shit, male, always, leave, relationship",1

[**TL;DR: Animated Video Post**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l96-rIqWeYU&)

It’s easy to understand why people exercise their bodies. Your physical appearance is observed every day when you look in the mirror. Failure to take care of the body has obvious repercussions. The mind is different. Unlike the body, maintenance failure is not as obvious. So why would one wish to expand their mind in the first place?

Expanding your mind allows you to have a more comprehensive understanding of reality, which in turn better equips you with the resources you will need to achieve your goals and live a happier life. Knowledge is potential power, and potential power is better than having no power at all. Simply put, you will have more tools and be more informed which will allow you to make better decisions.


##**1. Hang out with insightful people**##
The easiest way to become more insightful is to hang around insightful people. You become like the people with whom you surround yourself. You might have noticed that overweight parents tend to have overweight kids, or that athletic parents tend to have athletic kids. In many cases, the people with whom we often associate with are responsible for many of the beliefs and values that we uphold.

If the most insightful things your friends have to say have to do with ‘Game of Thrones’  fan theories, perhaps it’s time you start associating yourself with new people.  You need to hang out with people that will give you new perspectives and make you contemplate higher quality thoughts. You don’t have to get rid of your old friends, just find some new ones.

There has never been an easier time to find insightful people. Through the powers of the internet, you can find your clan with a simple Google search. These people tend to hang out in niche forums or in dedicated Facebook groups. If you really want to find them, you will!

##**2. Meditate**##

Meditation has been practiced in the East for thousands of years. The exercise is starting to gain more popularity in the West due to scientific backing and general open-mindedness.

There are many benefits that stem from meditation; some are more obvious than others. However, these benefits only become evident after you have made meditation a daily practice in your life. Just like in the gym you cannot expect to see a huge transformation in one week.

Some benefits include:

* Increased ability to focus
* Increased emotional stability
* Reduced stress
* Increased Gray Matter in the Brain [1]
 

Meditation allows you to observe your thoughts and choose which ones to follow. You will no longer be run by impulse. Consequently, you will become better at decision making. Meditation leads to the development of ‘meta-awareness’, which means being aware of your own awareness. Enhanced meta-awareness allows you to step outside yourself and to judge your actions as if you were an observer. This ability is critical for those who wish to expand their minds. In the pursuit of knowledge, one will be forced with the task of challenging their presumed beliefs and thought patterns. That is why meditation is essential.

**Tools for meditation:**

* Headspace app
* Guided Mediation videos on YouTube 

##**3. Listen to Audiobooks and Podcasts**##

If you are serious about expanding your mind, you will be an adherent of the ‘Kaizen’ philosophy. It’s Japanese for ‘continuous improvement’. We all have the same twenty-four hours in a day, but what separates us is how we spend that time.

You can learn almost anything with audiobooks and podcasts. You can download new information to your brain whilst doing everyday activities. I, personally, can get through and audiobook easily within 2-3 days. If I am consistent, that’s 2 books a week and over 100 books a year. Can you imagine how different your mind will be if you went through 100 books a year? You don’t even need to read that many books for your mind and perspectives to shift. Even 30 books is more than 90% of people would complete. Here are some activities you can do whilst listening to audiobooks:

* Commuting to work
* Vacuuming the house
* Cleaning your car
* Cleaning your dishes
* Walking the dog

There are plenty of opportunities throughout the day that will arise in which you can slip in an audiobook.

Podcasts are also good and have gained huge popularity over the past few years. The advantage of listening to a podcast is that they can cover specific topics that are normally difficult to research. Podcasts are a goldmine, and just like audiobooks can have the same influence on your mind.

**Tools for Audio:**

* Audible
* Itunes Podcasts (contains over 250,000 different stations)
* Soundcloud (contains amateur podcasts)
* YouTube 

##**4. Read Biographies**##

Imagine if you could sit down with some of the most influential people in history, and hear them tell you their life stories. Imagine if you could learn the lessons they have learned, or discover certain insights that they had. Well, this is possible with the aid of biographies, and more specifically autobiographies. You might never get a chance to talk to these people, but you can absorb their words. Biographies are incredibly useful in regards to expanding your mind because they allow you to consider different contexts.

The best thing about biographies is that they distill many of the lessons that would have been learned over a lifetime.  You will not receive the same amount of insight as the person who experienced the events, but you will gain knowledge.

You might never become a boxing legend, or blow hundreds of millions of dollars, but you can learn the lessons from Mike Tyson’s biography. You might not be a president who spent twenty-seven years in prison, but Nelson Mandela’s biography might have something to say about it. You didn’t win the Mr. Olympia, and you weren’t the terminator or governator. But Arnold Schwarzenegger was, and he wrote all about it.

You get the picture; there are many life lessons to be learned through reading biographies! So what are you waiting for?

**Tools for Biographies**

* Goodreads (Find ratings and top lists)
* Total Recall (Arnold Schwarzenegger’s biography, a personal favourite)
* Long Walk To Freedom  (Nelson Mandela’s biography, another favourite)

##**5. Watch Documentaries**##

I remember when I was a young man. I used to spend many hours a day watching documentaries. My favourite documentaries were ones that dealt with: Astronomy, Quantum Physics, classical physics, war history, wildlife, and crime investigation. I stopped the habit after the age of sixteen.  Last year during my Mechanical Engineering course I was tasked with choosing an elective subject. I decided to choose Astronomy because of my prior interest in the subject. To my surprise, much of the content discussed in the lectures, I had already learned as a teenager through documentaries! Topics such as: gravitational waves, black hole event horizons, the moons of Jupiter, supernova, and nebula formation, as well as the expanding universe seemed like common knowledge to me. Long story short, I ended up getting a high distinction for the class. I didn’t get the mark because of natural intelligence; instead I got it through the documentaries that I had enjoyed as a teenager.

Documentaries are a fun means to expand your mind, especially during your downtime! The good thing about them is that they don’t seem like work. Many people can’t stand reading because to them it seems like work, it reminds them of school. Documentaries offer an alternative to the usual means of education, and you can find some good quality information in them as well. You can watch a range of documentaries on YouTube as well as a number of online websites for free. Do not ignore this medium; I try to watch one every couple of days.

**Tools for documentaries**

* topdocumentaryfilms.com (watch documentaries for free)
* YouTube Playlists ( many free documentaries )
* IMBb Highest rated documentaries (a useful list)

##**6. Read Philosophy**##

Reading philosophy is easily one of the best ways to expand your mind. Philosophy is derived from Greek and means ‘love of wisdom’. If you love wisdom you will not ignore philosophy. Philosophy challenges you to question many things in your life through the use of reason. The capacity to reason is one of the special human endowments that distinguishes us from animals. If you wish to expand your mind, you must learn to reason and use critical thinking to gain clarity. Philosophical inquiry can lead you to entertain deeper thoughts than you have ever imagined. You might find yourself asking questions such as:

1. Is it worse to fail at something or never attempt it in the first place?
2. If I could change one thing about the world, what would it be?
3. To what extent do we shape our own destinies, and how much is down to fate?
4. Does nature shape our personalities more than nurture?
5. Should people care more about doing the right thing, or doing things right?
6. What single piece of advice should we offer to a newborn infant?
7. Where is the line between insanity and creativity?
8. What is true happiness?

Luckily for us, we can also read the ideas and conclusions made by some of the greatest thinkers who have ever lived. We can read philosophy from both the East and the West in order to form our own personal world view. I highly recommend you read philosophy if you are serious about expanding your mind.

**Tools for philosophy:**

* Philosophy in minutes (introductory book that summarises key concepts)
* The pig that wants to be eaten (fun philosophical conundrums)
* The Republic (classic text by Plato)
* Meditations (classic text by Marcus Aurelius)
* School of life Philosophy (a YouTube crash course in philosophy)

##**7. Learn a new language**##

Learning a new language is an extreme workout for the brain, it’s like running a couple of marathons and competing in a strongman competition straight after. Language is complex, and in often shapes how we see the world. Learning a new language forces you to learn new syntax structures, and a completely new vocabulary and way of describing the world. Research has shown people who are multilingual often:

* have higher general intelligence 
* are better at planning, prioritizing, and decision-making 
* have better focus, concentration and attention 
* have better memory and memorization skills, including better working memory 
* exhibit mental flexibility 

There are just so many benefits to learning a new language, and as society becomes more globalised you might be forced to learn a new one.

**Tools for language learning:**

openculture.com (free language lessons)
busuu.com (language lessons)

##**8. Learn programming**##

Programming, much like learning a new language, can be incredibly taxing on the brain. Steve Jobs famously said,

>“Everybody in this country should learn how to program a computer… because it teaches you how to think.”

Programming requires a structured and logical way to thinking, much like mathematics. Programming is advanced program solving that requires you to break down complicated problems into smaller manageable pieces that can be tackled. This structured way of thinking can then be applied to real-world scenarios. Good programmers are good problem solvers, and as the world becomes more technologically advanced, individuals with these skills will be rewarded greatly. Programming also requires incredible persistence as well as creativity. This is because small errors in a line of code can ruin the functionality of the end product.  Programming develops grit due to the persistence needed for it. It has been said that a young Bill Gates (Before his billionaire days) would often code for twelve hours straight. Gates would often fall asleep on the keyboard, wake up and continue his coding.

Programming has never been easier to learn as there are many of online resources and communities that can help you. I personally like to use codeacademy.com as you can learn a range of languages from HTML to C++. Go and give coding a try!

**Tools for programming:**

* Codeacademy.com (learn to code online for free)
* MIT ‘Introduction to Computer Science and Programming’ (free online course)
* Codeschool.com  (paid courses)
* Khan Academy ‘Computer Programming’ (free online course)

##**The Bottom Line**##

Expanding your mind is not rocket science. There is one common denominator between everything that I have listed. Everything challenges your mind in some way. Anything can be used as a tool to expand your mind, as long as it involves you learning something new. This list is by no means exhaustive; there are many things that I have omitted for example:

playing chess or any other strategy game
learning a new musical instrument
learning cognitive biases and heuristics
building up your memory
It’s up to you to figure out which tools you will use. I hope this article has been of value to you. Go out there and expand your mind!

Frame can't really be faked. And if you do fake it, it won't take long before women will poke holes in it. That's what they are meant to do.

Luckily, frame is directly related to your own personal value and belief system. So it doesn't actually take that much to alter. Even a low SMV man with a strong frame *can* work like magic on women (think of convicts and junkie musicians)

Here are the most important points to internalize and actually change your attitude to believe. If you truly make these points real in your mind, gaming will get easy for you.

1. You're better than her. (In every way except maybe taking care of a child)

2. She's there for YOUR entertainment. (Treat her like a servant and ask her to do favors for you)

3. She stopped maturing at 18. (Treat/tease her like a child.)

4. She's a nasty dirty cumguzzling whore for **the right guy.** ALL girls are very sexual. (Don't fear sexual implication, you're a man, it's natural and masculine)

5. You're more willing to walk away than her. Women need to feel that you do not need them. (Outcome Independence. This one is key. DO NOT be more invested than her.)

6. There's NOTHING that she can do to make you emotional and reactive. (Women should be literally incapable of getting under your skin. Nothing phases you. You've seen it all before and it's laughable when they try their mindfuck games)

7. Its her loss if you're hard rejected. You were simply trying to share some of your awesomeness with the world instead of being a selfish asshole and hogging it all to yourself. (Never forget that when you approach, you're OFFERING value to a girl, not LEECHING it. You're doing them a favor.)

8. Recognize knowledge of improvement. (No matter what happens, you're improving your approach and results in the future. Always. There's no such thing as going backwards in skill on approaches)

9. Failure is fun and embrace it (you should approach 9's and 10's to get shut down and learn the difference of their tests to get better).

10. You take/work for what you want. (See hot girl. Want to put dick in. Take steps to see if that's an option to get the desired result you want)

11. Walk and act like you have two french 10's that lick caviar off your balls as soon as you walk through the door every fucking day. (Ignore her beauty, you're used to smokeshows already. They're just girls..)

12. Sex is on your mind and your actions reflect it. (You should be undressing her with your eyes, spanking her/grabbing her ass every chance you get, escalating often, and whispering dirty things you want to do to her in her ear, grabbing her thigh when you're driving, etc. Be the fun sex guy. Leave ""Billy Beta"" in the fucking past)

13. You're the leader. (She follows you. YOU make the decisions, you call the shots, you design the plans. She's just along for the ride.)

14. Her moral recklessness and emotional rollercoaster riding is adorable to you. You've read briffault's law and you know WHAT they are, (not necessarily WHO they are.) You enjoy their fragility and savageness in the same breath.

15. Confidence and boldness is your default. (Walk like Brad Pitt, talk like George Cloony, fuck like Tyler Durden, and lift like Dwayne Johnson)

The average newcomer is probably a young man, out of shape, n-count below 5, addicted to porn and ready to jump through hoops and into a relationship for the first sweet chubby girl who will suck his dick. We’ve all been like this.


Newbie starts lurking at the sub and at first is disgusted by the *women-bashing* that goes against his core values. The language is for sure very direct and vulgar, and the stories about how these hot college girls were competing to suck the cock of this older guy are really hard to believe.. “What a bunch of fake-macho assholes, they’re probably all virgins and this is fantasy world”, he thinks. Yet something rings true in these stories and for whatever reason, he keeps coming back to the sub.


**Lesson learned at this stage:** what brought you to TheRedPill is obviously you natural craving for pussy, but also humility. It’s hard to admit that a lot of things you have been taught are wrong, and that you actually don’t know shit. Humility is necessary for growth, without humility you wouldn’t have found TRP. Keep this in mind for the future, when you stop being humble you stop growing.


**Risk**: the risk at this stage is to hold on for dear life to your bluepill mindset and to your ego, and reject the redpill without actually taking the time to dig in a little.




**

 

II.                   **The truth sinks in like a dark cloud**


You’ve tried to resist the Truth, because it’s ugly and cold, and it doesn’t sit well with you. But the Truth doesn’t care about your feelings, it just is. Sure, in the upcoming weeks you will apply redpill principles and will be amazed to see them work so well, but you already know it’s the Truth even before you have had the chance to test it: Briffault’s law, the Hamster, female love vs male love, it just hits you in the face and you can’t escape it.


Let’s be fair, this is all VERY depressing. You enter the anger phase. Fuck this society and these lies. Fuck women, I hate them! What’s the point of living this masquerade? You recall all the instances when you thought a woman was actually caring about you, when she was in fact using you. You cringe at the recent memories of bluepill you acting like a doormat.


**Lesson learned at this stage:** Life in itself is no fairy tale. Swallowing the pill and learning the truth doesn’t make you happier, actually it’s the opposite at first, it makes you sadder. 


**Risk**: The risk is to give in to this desperate state, and say “fuck everything, I’ll just stay home and wank to porn and play video games”. You blame your thirst for pussy, and declare you don’t need women. Problem is, it’s not really about pussy in the end. Blue pill society has made you believe that it’s ok to be weak and the lowest version of yourself.  But now TRP teaches you that women won’t get wet for that, rightfully so. If you don’t want to improve and be the best you can be, just admit it and don’t lie to yourself by saying it’s about not wanting pussy. No, it’s about not wanting to grow. Looking at you, the angry half of MGTOW.


**
 

III.                 **Ooh so now women want me? I fucking hate them. And those amogging alphas too**


A few weeks in, you’ve hit the gym and the first gains are showing fast. Thank god for this boost of confidence, because the rest is much slower: it takes time to internalize everything. You try to act Alpha but you only end up looking like a dick, because it comes from a place of anger rather than confidence.  You start spouting some redpill truths that no one wants to hear in a social setting.


But at least you have developed some self-respect and you’d rather lose the girl than act like a doormat. And just like that, you start having some success, albeit limited at first. More important, your eyes are now open and you’re impressed to see how women manipulate and can be manipulated, how superficial they are, how much they fake and lie, etc. The more it works, the more you get pussy, the more you start to hate women for loving the new you more than the old you.


You get average girls with no problem, but your confidence is shattered the minute a true Alpha Chad appears. Suddenly you cease to exist in women’s eyes, he’s so much cooler than you, effortlessly. You feel amogged and you respond by being aggressive against this dude who steals your thunder, and you look like a douche. But as long as Chad isn’t around, you’re doing fine. 


**Lesson learned at this stage:** Be careful what you wished for. You wanted the secret code to have unlimited pussy? Well now that you have it, it doesn’t seem so fun anymore. Understanding nature deprives you of mystery and fantasy.


**Risk**: You start hating what you crave the most. The risk is to not snap out of this, and become a lying sociopath who relishes using and hurting other people. Also, your friends are really not okay with you improving and disturbing the social balance that was set in your group. They make fun of you trying to improve and, if you listen to them, you’ll be back to smoking weed and playing video games at home every night.

 
**


IV.                **You get pussy, he gets pussy, everyone gets pussy!!  And now you’re a social object**


A couple of years after swallowing the pill, if you’ve been dedicated to improving, everything becomes natural. You have risen to the top of your social circles. You have social power now, and you understand that this is the currency women live for. Girls, but also guys, bug you constantly and insist just to spend time with you. You must learn how to say ‘no’, to average girls coming straight at you, to beta friends who guilt you into spending another Friday with them, to family members, colleagues, etc. Your social life is boosted and your social media start to be filled with new events and faces. One good thing is that after hating women and their nature, you learn to appreciate them again, but this time for what they really are: bubbly, beautiful creatures that only live in the present and remind us to enjoy every minute of our lives.


Also, you fuck. A LOT. Constantly. Your n-count rises up by dozens in a few months. At parties, good-looking girls come at you and actually compete with one another for your attention. You have multiple plates, you don’t care about dropping some because there are always new women that you are vetting just for the privilege to become part of the rotation. More scaringly, most of your beta friends’ girlfriends have made a move to fuck you. You have, ultimately, the power. And so, the moral responsibility is now your burden, as well as the task to unbetafy your friends.


**Lesson learned at this stage:** Everybody you know, in your expanding social circle, wants a piece of you. Even if they can’t fuck you, they want to be seen with you, to show you off, just to increase their social value. You start to understand how hot girls, who get a thousand times more attention, become jaded and bitchy. It’s hard to have to reject people constantly while maintaining a good-hearted spirit.


**Risk**: You are now the king of your own little kingdom, you fuck 6s and 7s constantly with no effort, they just come knocking at your door. Your friends -and their girlfriends-  revere you. The risk is to enjoy this too much, be satisfied and stop improving. Soon enough you end up marrying a good looking 6 and get fat while watching football with the same beta friends you had. Still better than your past self, but you could do so much more.. This point is actually where I think a lot of redpillers get stuck. They stop improving the minute all their needs are met.

 
**


V.                  **Pizza is awesome, but in the end it’s just pizza. Let’s look for more important things**


It’s been a few years now, and you’ve grown into a full-blown alpha. You look much better than you ever did. Not only is your physical frame solid, but also knowing the Truth has molded your brain in a different way, and as mind and body align, you start to have a different stare, a different voice that comes from within, a confident demeanor, a calm and solid posture. People say you’ve changed, but they can’t really pinpoint why. This is why: you own 100% of your shit, you’re basically unshameable. If you get wasted at a bar you’ll still hit on the hottest girl, and will get her to come home, and if you go soft the hot girl will actually be turned on by how much you don’t care about losing her. You’ve had threesomes, sex with gorgeous girls 15 years younger, blowjobs from girls you met in an elevator. You don’t lie because you don’t need to lie anymore. You can tell a girl that you just fucked another girl two hours ago in the same sheets, it doesn’t matter, if she leaves there are so many in line. You realize the stories you read on The Red Pill when you were a newbie were all true, as the same crazy things happen to you, and more.


At this point, pussy is in free access. It’s like pizza. You love it, everybody loves pizza, even bad pizza is still pizza. A few years ago you would have eaten pizza every day if you had the chance, but now you realize it’s just a cool thing you can get whenever you want. You start to enjoy other things than women, like finding and dedicating yourself to your mission, the real friends you have, etc.  


**Lesson learned at this stage:** Now when another Alpha enters the room, you’re actually genuinely happy. What you thought was amogging a few years ago, is actually him testing you to see if you’re solid. Now you stand your ground and banter back, and both guys are delighted to meet another real man in an ocean of male and female betas. Also, neither of you cares about who gets the hottest girl because you have so many chicks lined up, and that’s how you know you’re both Chads. And when you end up turning one of your beta friends into an alpha, there is no better feeling than this.


**Risk**: In all your masculine glory, you have applied your skills and efforts to something (getting pussy), and have mastered this art. See how amazing that feels, to be on top of that mountain? But there are way bigger mountains around,  things more worthy of your masculine energy than pussy. Don’t get stuck on such a trivial thing, find your mission and focus on it.",1015,2,0.2678000032901764,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck",3

Honestly some of the extreme views on MGTOW reddit offend me. They can be very sexist and discriminatory. So I'm somewhat hesitant to associate myself with MGTOW. Having said there I think there are a lot of good, well-intention people on here and I respect that.

I feel like there are maybe three or more stages men go through:

1. **Ignorance** - unaware of current status quo and the imbalances.

2. **Anger** at women and society which we see on MGTOW reddit.

3. **Self-love and strong boundaries** - Understand that we are all fallible. Women are like us men.... just trying to get through life. That doesn't mean we need to demonize them. We can reject the status quo and lead good, healthy lives in harmony with others while respecting women. That doesn't mean we have to bend to their will.

I was 5 when I threw sand in some girl's face in retaliation (she threw sand in mine.) She started crying.

The girl's dad, an unemployed welfare hick, came to the fence separating our property-

*""I'm gonna come over this fence and beat your son's ass!""*

My dad is standing in front of me-

**""If you come over that fence, I'll rip your fucking head off and shit down your windpipe.""**

I remember the look on my dad's face- determination, his eyes wide but fierce, almost crazy in fact. His jaw was locked, his fist clinched whilst I clung to his leg. He looked lethal- like a gun ready to go off. 

The guy never did come over that fence.

***

Growing up, I was scrawny and weak. Picked on, and half the time I deserved it. Big mouth, annoying, weird. I would stick up for my friends and promptly get the shit kicked out of me. I didn't even put up a good fight. The most damage I ever did to another person was a bite on the leg after being jumped by three kids. When I opened my swollen eyes to see why the punches stopped after I sunk my teeth in, I looked up to see that the person I bit was the adult who came to my rescue the house over. I bit the guy who saved me.

3 years ago, I signed up at a BJJ gym. I put my time in. I left that gym and signed up for an MMA gym 2 years ago. I'm now one of the instructors at my gym.

I convinced my step brother to sign up 6 months ago. ""Don't you want better for yourself?"" I asked him. He signed up.

4 months ago, whilst he's lifting weights, he sees a girl who's also lifting and wrestling. She has muscles in all the right places. Fit, pretty, HB8 by my standards but an SMV of 4. He tells another gym-mate, ""Who is that? She's pretty!""

The person he told was one of the amateur fighters at our gym. He is unemployed and is all-in on his, so far, lackluster fighting career. He's 24, this is it for him.

He's also the boyfriend of this girl.

*""That's my fucking girlfriend.""*

My step brother apologizes, tells him he didn't know, and steers clear of both thereafter.

***

2 months ago- I'm coming out of the gym and invite one of my gym-mates out to pizza with my step brother.

AmateurFighter overhears.

*""Hey bro, I like pizza! Also, you have a step brother?""*

I smile, and respond-

**""Yeah, my step brother is __!""**

He frowns, and gets a serious look on his face.

""*Oh, that fucking guy! Why hasn't he been coming to the gym to get fucked up? Tell him I'm looking for him.""*

I smile again, throwing warmth in my eyes and using a higher tone than I'd care to-

**""Oh, he's injured and has been taking a break. But no worries on the whole girlfriend thing, I handled it and now he knows!""**

""*Tell him I'm looking for him.""* He repeated.

**""Well bud, don't look too hard!""** I responded with a smile, before driving away.

***

I'm sitting at the pizza place with my step brother. We're going over RP truths. I believe we were talking about value and physical fitness. I was theorizing how sexual strategy was a two sided coin, you can either game women through subterfuge or you could be skilled enough to physically challenge your competition. Either should, in theory, give women the tingles.

I look over to my step brother, and I tell him about what had transpired at the gym before I came to the pizza parlor. AmateurFighter had injured 2 other fighters over the years over perceived slights against his relationship, he had made many more threats. He had a reputation. He had pushed one of the instructors over an alleged *leer* towards his girlfriend.

**""Don't worry, brother. You're family. I have your back.""** I was thinking back upon my father's old saying: he had just gone to the hospital again the day prior. There was no guarantee he would make it at this time.

**""You and my dad are all I have in this world.""** I thought back to my dad's words. I had nothing to lose, all I could think about was my father and how close I was to losing him. 

I see a familiar car pull up in the parking lot.

AmateurFighter had arrived, uninvited.

My step brother becomes apprehensive- *""oh shit.""* He says with some concern.

**""Don't worry, I'll handle it.""** I assure him.

AmateurFighter throws open the door. His gait is with purpose, his face has the look of a man looking for a fight. He doesn't even look at me, his eyes are fixated on my step brother.

I smile, add warmth to my eyes, I throw my hands out and say in a high voice, **""hey, AmateurFighter! I don't remember inviting you!""**

No acknowledgment. He comes up behind my step brother, he forcefully places his hand on the nape of his neck. He leans in, *""hey man, you said something pretty disrespectful about my girlfriend-""*

I shot out of the seat in a flash. I knocked over the tables and chairs. I secured a cross-collar grip on his jacket with my forearm against his throat. I pushed him against the wall.

**""This isn't the fucking place for that.""** I growled, my voice resuming it's natural deep Bass that I normally hide. My eyes bore into him with a wild-eyed look, not unlike my father's back in the day.

He threw his hands up. His eyes darted around in visible fear. He didn't respond, he didn't move. His eyes never met mine throughout the exchange.

**""If I wanted you here, I would've given you a fucking invite. Now get the fuck out of here.""** I finished. 

The staff rushed over, attempting to separate us. It was like time stood still. The whole room had been enveloped in my frame. I released him and the staff proceeded to escort him out, threatening police. I proceeded to sit back down to finish my pizza and beer, and continue my conversation with my step brother. In spite of me being asked to leave, the staff didn't push the issue and I remained unmolested for the rest of the night.

I looked over to my step brother and clasped his hand with mine. I looked him in the eye-

**""You had my word that I had your back.""**

**""One day, I may need you stand for me, much like I did for you today. I may become injured and weak""**

**""That guy won't let this go. His ego won't stand for it. So you better learn how to defend yourself, because I won't always be around.""**

**""But lucky for you, and unlucky for him, I was here. He put his hand on the stove and he got burned.""**

He acknowledges this, and we finish talking about TRP without further issue.

***

As I walk out, I see the AmateurFighter and the gym-mate I had invited earlier hanging out down the ways, waiting for us to leave. I expected the worst.

**""Get in the car and leave, bro.""** I command. He reluctantly obliges, still mindful of his injuries from the week previous during training.

I walk over to the group. I felt relaxed but wound-up. I was calm and I had a sense of certainty. Fear, something I would normally feel when I was younger, was strangely absent.

I felt lethal, but I was also mindful that I needed to be functional for my dad's sake. Regardless, in my mind, there was only one way this situation would go if it came down to it.

AmateurFighter starts talking.

*""Dude, ketogainsmongoose, I'm sorry. I came here to talk to you!""*

**""Don't bullshit me, AmateurFighter, you came here looking to cause problems for my step brother. You put his hands on him. You simply expected me to stand by, but you put your hand on the stove and got burned, now you're trying to pretend you weren't here to fuck him up.""**

*""He disrespected my girlfriend! She doesn't know what just happened in there! I asked her if she was offended, and she said yes! I asked if she wanted an apology, she said yes! I was just gonna have him come outside and apologize to her!""*

**""Bullshit. You came in with anger on your face and in your heart. You put your hands on him. You violated man's law. You disrespected me by coming here.""**

*""But I thought you invited me!""*

**""How the hell would you figure that?""**

*""You said 'don't look too hard!' that wasn't an invite?""*

I laugh.

**""You're an idiot. That was a threat. I was trying to hint to you to back the fuck off.""**

*""But my girlfriend wanted an apology!""*

**""Fuck your girlfriend, and fuck her apology.""**

I see a shadow move in the passenger side of his car. The girlfriend has been sitting in the car this whole time, listening to this exchange, without me realizing it.

***

I walked away unmolested that night. In a fit of rage, AmateurFighter had confronted our coach, the owner, at the gym over another issue regarding the girlfriend ""being harassed."" This time she alleged that she was 'touched' inappropriately by another instructor and waited a week to report it. A view of the cameras inside proved the allegation was false. When Coach told him as much, AmateurFighter pushed him to the ground.

The coach, knowing what had transpired with me and AmateurFighter the week before, banned both AmateurFighter and his girlfriend, and threatened him with police.

***

Some amongst the viewership question the authenticity of the field reports and stories posted on TRP as of late.

I'm here to tell you why you're simply a pussy-ass bitch who deserves your boring, uneventful, unfulfilling life.


Every single day, opportunities present themselves for you to drop the facade and be a man. Here it comes! Your chance to actually have something *unbelievable* happen in your life! A situation that would make your friends shake their heads in disbelief and say, ""bullshit, I don't believe you!""

And every single time, you choke.

You see other men, being men, and rationalize it as bullshit. Because the bitter truth, that you're simply a coward, is too hard for you to swallow.

You hamster away opportunities to show the world and yourself what you're made of.

""I need this job.""

""It's not worth the hassle.""

""Karma will get him.""

""One day, he'll mess with the wrong guy.""

""He's not worth it.""

""He's just lucky I can control my temper.""

""If *insert ideal conditions here* then I'd show him!""

You're just a pussy That's all there is to it. You're afraid to speak your piece because you're afraid of all the things you'd lose in your life.

Your job.

Your house.

Your bills.

Your car.

Your girlfriend.

Your wife.

Your kids.

And on and on it goes.

Those who would trade their self-respect for security, will neither be safe nor will they receive respect.

If you can't stand up to the random petty Tyrants riddled along your path in life, how the hell are you supposed to stand up for yourself when it matters?

If you don't take a stand now, you'll never catch up to those who trudged along, ignoring the crabs that attempted to pull them down.

Stop being a crab. Start being a man. Get your ass out of the house and stand for something.

Quit making excuses for why today just isn't the day to stand up for yourself.

If a man has enemies, that's good! It means he actually stood for something in his life.

If you're tired of looking in the mirror and seeing a doormat, dig in your heels and start being a man for a change.

Go out there and live life.

I walked up to a beautiful girl and said, “Hey, I thought you were cute, and I had to say hi.” She smiled, said thank you, and we talked for a couple minutes until she paused and said, “It was nice to meet you,” and walked away. I never saw her again.

I’ve read dozens of books teaching men how to attract women with lines, tactics, and tricks. But after 10 years in the game, thousands of approaches, and yes, a good number of “lays” – I’ve found that attracting women isn’t something you can force. In fact, the harder you try to get a woman to like you, the less attractive you will be to her.

When that girl from the above example rejected me, I could have blamed it on the line I used. But truthfully, no matter what I said, the result would have been the same. This is because attraction isn’t something you do, it’s something you are.

Of all the times I attracted a woman, not once did I attract her because of some technique I used. Every single time, I attracted her because of who I was.

There’s a saying, “The self is always shining through.” Basically, no matter how hard you try to “make a girl like you” using some tactic, it won’t work because using a technique to attract a woman is in itself a form of overcompensation.

We only use techniques because on some level we don’t believe we’re good enough by default, so we try to make up for our inadequacy with a line or a trick(1).

I can’t teach you how attract a specific girl using techniques, but I CAN teach you how to be an attractive man who naturally draws women in.

There’s no quick-fix. Becoming the most attractive version of yourself requires that you invest both time and effort in yourself. But the end result is easily worth it. Over-time - by following the 4 tips in this article - you will become exponentially more appealing to the opposite sex.

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 1:
##Develop your Self-Confidence

&nbsp;

It’s no secret that self-confidence is attractive, but what is it, really?

If asked, most people would say, “Self-confidence is belief in yourself.” And that’s true, but there’s a key component missing in that definition.

Self-confidence isn’t just belief in yourself, it’s the belief that everything will turn out okay when you attempt something.

Self-confidence doesn’t mean you expect every girl to like you, it simply means that you’re okay with the consequences of taking a risk, even if the girl doesn’t like you.

When we lack self-confidence with women, we think that rejection is the worst thing that could happen to us. That fear causes us to filter ourselves in conversation, to adopt defensive body language, and even to speak with a weaker vocal tonality.

Our inner lack of confidence causes us to behave less attractively. The more confident you become, the more attractive you will be - because you’ll stop getting in your own way.

How do you actually do that? Well, how do we become confident in anything? Take driving for example. We become confident drivers by giving our brains proof that when we take the wheel, disaster will not ensue.

Every time we drive - and we live to tell the tale - we become a little more confident in ourselves as a driver. The same applies to dating. Every time you take a social risk, and come out the other side unharmed, you will become a little bit more confident.

For example, the more women you approach, the lower the stakes will feel when you walk up to a girl, because you’ll become comfortable with the possibility of getting rejected.

What this means will vary from person to person. For many guys just starting their journey, the first step to developing self-confidence will just be getting out of the house, for others it will be something bolder.

As you develop your self-confidence, you will become more attractive to women. Fortunately, if you utilize tip 4, the process of confidence building will largely take place automatically.

The most important take-aways from this are that you can’t fake confidence, and that it will take time to develop – BUT your level of confidence is completely under your control and improving it will make you more attractive.

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 2:
##Develop Standards

&nbsp;

The more women you’re willing to reject, the more attractive to women you will become. This is counter-intuitive, but it’s true.

If there is one thing that turns women off more than anything, it’s neediness. A guy acts needy when he is so desperate to be with a girl that no matter what she does or says, he would still sleep with her.

Neediness is suffocating. It shows that you take getting with a girl way too seriously and that you see yourself as incapable of getting another girl of her caliber if you wanted to.

Most of the guys I’ve met who have trouble attracting women (and there are many) have a problem with neediness. They see girls as a means to an end. They will happily sleep with any girl because that makes them feel like they “won”.

Men with this mindset don’t meet women to connect with another human being, but to get a sense of accomplishment from sleeping with a girl.

These guys don’t have standards for themselves. They see a hot girl as a prize to be won, so they are desperate to get her. Her personality is irrelevant. Her values are irrelevant.

When you see women as mere sex-objects, it’s impossible to have a real human interaction with them. And, naturally, a man who sees a woman as a human being is much more likely to attract her than a man who sees her as the fleshy equivalent of a gold coin.

The best way to eliminate this neediness that derives from seeing attractive women as prizes is to develop standards. Instead of being the guy who will do anything to get with the hot girl, you want to be the guy who’s interested in the hot girl but hasn’t decided if he wants to sleep with her yet.

Just like confidence, this can’t be faked. Pretending that you have standards by disqualifying a girl or negging her won’t make her see you as a high-status guy. You have to develop actual standards.

A good place to start is to make a clear list of what you won’t accept in a woman you’re considering dating (in whatever capacity). For reference, here’s a few of the things I won’t accept in a woman:

-If a girl has any kind of drug addiction, I’m out.

-If she’s unhealthily narcissistic, I’m out

-If she has a negative mindset, I’m out.

-If she is uninteresting, I’m out.

When I’m interacting with a woman, I’m screening her for the above traits. She might be a perfect ten in appearance, but if she’s narcissistic and uninteresting, I’m not going to sleep with her. To do so would be selling myself short.

The only reason I would sleep with that girl is because it would give me a sense of ego-gratification. I’d be doing it, so I could tell my friends about, not because to do so would actually be enjoyable.

In my experience, at least, sex is better when you actually like the person. Physical attraction is important, too, sure. But I’ve been with extremely beautiful women in the past who I didn’t have any chemistry with - and it was crappy.

Writing a list of the things you won’t tolerate in a potential sexual partner and rejecting women who don’t meet those standards is a powerful strategy for becoming more attractive to women. (Btw, it’s also useful to write a list of the things you do want in a partner.)

When you’re interacting with a beautiful woman and you’re willing to reject her depending on what she does and says, the entire dynamic changes. Instead of acting like a guy who would do anything to get laid, you will act like a guy who has an abundance of options.

Your non-neediness will make you infinitely more attractive than all the desperate guys pining after her. But this starts with taking a moment to write out what you want (and don’t want) in a girl you’re considering having a sexual relationship with.

&nbsp;

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 3:
##Improve your Appearance

&nbsp;

Looks matter. The better looking you are, the higher percentage of women will make it easy for you to pick them up. At the same time, no matter how unattractive you are, some percentage of women will be attracted to you if are confident, non-needy, etc. (and that percentage is probably higher than you think).

There are two important misconceptions about looks that must be cleared up:

-Waiting to get in shape before meeting women is a silly idea.
-Your looks matter, but they don’t exist in a vacuum.

A lot of guys realize that looks matter, so they decide that once they’ve got their looks “handled” they’ll start approaching women. This is problematic because it can easily turn into a form of procrastination. Your appearance is something that you can constantly improve, but you’ll never reach a particular point where you’ve “made it”. Furthermore, improving your looks won’t make game easy. I’ve seen numerous good-looking guys fail at game. These guys expect their looks to do all the work for them, but truth is you still have to be very confident and assertive to succeed with women.

The vast majority of guys don’t have the confidence necessary to take a woman home, and that’s something you can only develop through practice. Thinking you look good helps, but it’s not magically going to make you comfortable with social risk taking –(if only it were that simple).

Improve your appearance while also improving your social skills. It’s not one or the other, it’s both. Focusing on your looks while neglecting to actually interact with women is a recipe for failure.

Social skills, confidence, and physical attractiveness are all important when it comes to dating, don’t sell yourself short by improving one and neglecting the others. To do so would be as silly as learning how to shoot in basketball, but not how to dribble or pass.

That said, you can make a staggering improvement in your appearance in the course of a single day. Get a high-end salon haircut. Buy some clothes that fit well and don’t make you look like you live in your mother’s basement. Simply dressing better and having a sense of style will make you more substantially more attractive. It’s not going to make up for a lack of confidence and experience, but it’s a good start. And really, 95% of guys in the seduction community have plenty of room to improve their style.

I’m no expert on fashion, but here are a couple resources you can look at to get started with:

http://masculine-style.com/rugged-refined-and-rakish/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiAubtXLnFs

Obviously, when it comes to improving your looks, style is only half the battle. There’s no reason not to be in good shape. If you’re not already working out regularly, the easiest way to start is to go to the gym with a friend of yours who’s already in good shape.

Having a gym buddy will help keep you accountable to working out even when you don’t feel motivated. Plus, if your friend is in good shape, they’ll be able to help provide you with guidance.

If you don’t have a friend who can help you, there’s an unlimited number of fitness guides you can download. Find someone you resonate with and trust and follow their plan. If you have trouble being consistent, get a trainer to hold you accountable and provide guidance.

&nbsp;

##How To Be An Attractive Man Key 4:
##Treat Dating Like A Skill

&nbsp;

Whatever you want to accomplish in life, there are certain elements that are outside of your control. - If you want to be a doctor, a low IQ is a disadvantage that’s outside your control. - If you want to get rich, having a poor family is disadvantage that’s outside your control. - If you want to date beautiful women, factors like your height, race, etc. can be disadvantages that are outside your control.

Dating coaches who say factors like your race and height don’t matter are lying. Sure, they matter, but they’re out of your control: worrying about them is only going to hurt you.

When you tell yourself, “Girls don’t like Asians,” you’re going to see your interactions with women through that lens. If you walk up to a girl, and she rejects you, you’re going to say, “It’s because I’m Asian. If I were white that wouldn’t have happened.”

This narrative becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When you’re interacting with a woman, and you expect her not to like you, you’ll act different than if you expect her to like you. Your insecurities will show up in your behavior, and when she rejects you, you’ll think, “It’s because I’m Asian.” Then you’ll become even more insecure, women will like you even less, and so on.

You can’t change your race, but you can change many of the other factors that create sexual attraction. The guy who wants to get rich but has a poor family can work twice as hard as his competition, and within a few years he can get to a point where he’s making a six-figure income.

Similarly, a short Asian guy with a below average face can succeed with women IF he works twice as hard as his competition and focuses on the factors that are under his control. His level of self-confidence is under his control, his style and fitness are under his control, and his ability to take social risks is under his control.

Look, with the above example, I said that the guy with a poor family could make six-figures, I didn’t say he can become a billionaire. Being a billionaire probably requires a certain amount of luck, the right family, being born in right time and place, the right genetics, etc.

But anyone can make six-figures with enough time and effort. The same is true in dating. If you’re naturally a four on a looks scale, I can’t promise that you’ll be able to date Victoria’s Secret models, but you can still bat way out of your league and hook up with attractive girls.

By treating dating as a skillset, you can date higher quality women than you would otherwise. If you fixate on whether you can get “perfect tens” you’re just going to cause yourself frustration.

We have these fantasies, whether it’s to be a billionaire or to sleep with “10s”. These fantasies stifle us because they’re so far outside of our reality. Worry about pulling “10s” when you can already pull “9s” easily. Treat dating like a skillset by taking it one step at a time. Don’t spend much time learning how to build attraction when you still have crippling approach anxiety.

-I know a guy who’s great at getting women attracted to him, but he always chokes by leaving the interaction before anything sexual can happen. He would massively improve his results if he focused on leading interactions forward by inviting the girl to the dance floor, to another area, etc.

-I know another guy who is great at opening girls, but he’s so quiet they don’t pay attention to him. He would gain so much by working on his volume.

 -I know a third guy who is great at dating girls who aren’t particularly attractive. But he won’t even approach girls who he thinks are pretty. He’s unnecessarily limiting himself to only date women that are far worse looking than he is!

I could give countless examples like the above. No, these guys can’t change their race, but they can learn to lead interactions forward, to speak louder, or to approach more attractive women.

In dating, there countless factors that are under your control. Worrying about the things outside your control is silly when there are so many things you can proactively improve on.

Don’t think about your race, think about your confidence. Don’t think about your height, think about your inability to approach attractive women.

Treat dating as a skill, and you can improve your results dramatically. Treat it like something entirely based on your genetics, and you’ll just drown yourself in self-pity.

&nbsp;

###Skill Only Comes with Practice

&nbsp;

The other key to treating dating like a skill, is to practice. If you spent 5 hours a week reading about how to pass a basketball, but never went out and played the game, people would think you’re an idiot.

Yet it’s common for guys to spend dozens- if not hundreds - of hours learning about how to attract women, without going out into the world and practicing. Intellectual learning is only useful if you’re spending most of your time in the real world getting real feedback.

Imagining what a good basketball shot looks like is completely different from taking the actual shot. Similarly, imagining what a good approach looks like is completely different from doing the approach. Information is only helpful to provide some guidance, it can’t do the work for you. Only real practice can.

It’s a lot easier to read about picking up women than it is to actually do it. I know this as well as anyone. When I first learned about the seduction community, I spent over a year watching videos without doing a single approach. Was it helpful? No. If anything, my social skills got worse because I became so overanalytical. Learning how to attract women without practicing is just as absurd as trying to learn any other skill without practicing.

Treating dating like a skillset is difficult. It takes patience, time, and effort to do so. Here are some resources that can help you if you get stuck:

This books both give you a step-by-step strategy for going out, meeting women, and developing your pickup skillset:

##Conclusion: How To Be An Attractive Man

&nbsp;

There you have it, how to be an attractive man. Any of the four tips can change your life individually, but master all four and you won’t believe the successes you’ll have.

Reading is how to do this is the easy part, becoming more attractive to women is a long-term process. Remember, anyone who tells you it’s going to be easy - that you can use some “hack” to succeed with women – is more interested in making money than in helping you improve.

Changing your life is hard, but what’s the alternative? Approaching women can be painful, but not nearly as painful as it would be to settle for a woman you’re not happy with because “she was the best you could get” (which is what the majority of men end up doing).

Fortunately, most of the factors that make a man attractive to women are under your control. If you’re willing to treat dating like a skill, you can master it.

-

Below are examples of each one listed, the motivation behind them, and how to respond. 

-

----------------------
----------------------

-

**1)** HER sending sexually suggestive pictures

* **Example A**: Kid on askTRP received sexy pics from some girl. OP took this as a sign of a guaranteed lay and proceeded to tell her how hot it was and what he wanted to do to her. Girl loses interest. He's left confused.

-

The purpose of the girl sending a naughty pic in the the askTRP kid's situation was to see if he'd drool over her. She was dangling pussy on a stick to see if he'd try to pounce on it immediately. He did, thus demonstrating low value via thirst. **Women want you to escalate while showing sexual restraint**. By not going for the kill, she perceives you as not desperate because you have other options and this is nothing special. Male sexuality is based almost entirely on physique while female sexuality focuses on refusal to give them short-term validation in response to their power grabbing moves and other *abstract* traits that *indirectly* insinuate signs of past sexual success, not your looks or body (especially hot girls).

-

Before the phones became 'smart phones', when they were flip-phones with a pull-out antennae, press buttons, a low resolution camera, and a very primitive email app, if it had apps at all, this would be a different story. When texting was invented, Myspace was in its infancy, Youtube just came out, and Napster and Limewire were cool, a naughty pic would be a sure sign of DTF. But now historical internet porn is common Instagram photos of everyday girls. They post pictures of them dressed and posed in a manner only hookers were known for in the not so far past. **Suggestive pics don't mean shit anymore. That pic she sent wasn't spontaneous out of lust for you, it was one carefully crafted long ago she had saved on her phone and is probably somewhere on the internet already and was sent to several guys in the past**.

-

Men send suggestive pics (i.e. [dick pics](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=krHKxPzl2-A)) in hopes of invoking a woman's arousal enough to want to fuck with low effort. Women send suggestive images to acquire validation and test your value. She has little concern, if at all, for sex, although intrigued. Far from the finish line. 

-

 * **Example B**: Friend of mine matched with a girl on Tinder and began to exchange messages. Tinder girl starts playing games. Friend says bye and unmatches her. Tinder girl later follows him on Snapchat. She sends him a sexy pic. Friend sends one back. She's send another in addition with a ""you gotta earn it"" -like line. Friend laughs and says no thanks. Girl throws a tantrum. 

-

In this case, the girl tried to use her pussy to get my friend to jump through hoops in hopes of sex that was likely never to come to boost her ego. When that didn't work, she went into frame recovery mode. She sent that first pic hoping she would get my friend to do what the askTRP kid in the Example A did, smother her in validation. My friend's response pic wasn't good enough, she wants an overt display to feel a sense of power. So she sends another thinking she can reel him in with the same games she played during the Tinder convo. My friend sees what's up and just ghosts her. If my friend did what the askTRP kid did, she would immediately withdraw and cease contact with him ==> *""teehee, I win. Bye""*. It's all just a game to her. Validation is sex to women. Sex is secondary, often times a 'last resort' way of acquiring the validation they failed to get in the beginning. 

-

edit: **What to Do**: When you recieve one of these pics, give her a small compliment, but nothing more. ""That's hot."", ""bad girl"", anything that suggests slight interest or is sexual. Even tell her you'd like to see her in a specific color or whatever, but don't drool. Keep it short and sweet and wait at least a few minutes before responding to it. The game isn't over yet.

- 

**TL;DR** pics ain't shit. Anything not face to face doesn't matter. [You say yousa freak, you gon' prove it or nah?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUj0otkJEBo)

**2)** HER talking about other guys hitting on her

-

* **Example A**: An ex-girlfriend and I were doing the long distance relationship thing during college. I got a text one evening stating that she had guys ask her out but refused them saying she had a boyfriend. Me: *""Good.""* She then replied with *""I just wanted to you to know that you could trust me.""*

-

Sounds so nice right? She's letting you know you can trust her! If you believe that, you're clueless. **She didn't send this text to alleviate my anxieties, but to INSTILL them in me. It's dread game disguised as noble intention** (plausible deniability), a favorite weapon among ALL women's psychological warchests. Not AWALT, *all women DO that*. She wanted to see me get jealous and worried by blowing up her phone. She wished to see the power she had over me.

-

The best way to respond is ""okay"" or ""I trust you"". That's it. She will likely attempt to instigate drama by bringing it up again and again, attempting to 'reassure you of her loyalty'. Don't fall for it. She may even try to peg the blame on you for not being worried enough. Don't give this a second thought. Drama is for women. **When you wrestle with pigs you both get dirty and the pigs like it**. 

-

I've heard this tactic take many forms like a guy tried to kiss her or touched her butt or men from her sexual past or whatever. Same shit. 

-

 * **Example B**: Same girl told me that she hung with a 'friend' the other day while driving somewhere. Me: ""okay"". Didn't give it any attention. I noticed her looking uncomfortable...... While sitting on her couch later that day, she wanted to confess that it was an ex-boyfriend, but assured me I had nothing to worry about. I ignored it, but the direct acknowledgement of it started to bother me. Come Christmas Eve night, I told her we should 'talk' about it. Long story short, I cried like a faggot with her on her porch bench, telling each other we'll be together forever and trust one another. Christmas Day, family and I were opening presents. My father noticed I was down. I told him what happened. He gave me some tips on how to handle it. Felt better, applied the tips, and it worked in the future. 

-

She told me this instill dread in me. She insisted on telling me because she wanted to be punished for her bad behavior. Women had a deep seated need to observe you setting boundaries. What do you do if a woman decides to do 1-on-1 meetups with ex-boyfriend or other dudes? **Answer**: When a woman indirectly mentions other men, ignore it. When she 'confesses', punish her indirectly by withdrawing attention with no explanation or a bullshit one. Women don't communicate directly.

-

**3)** A girl threatening to leave your presence

-

I was at a bar once. At a table near an exit was a trio. A couple and the girl's friend. The conversation between the couple slowly escalated into an argument and the girl began to creep backwards towards the door while talking to the boyfriend. She slung her last insult and announced, ""I'm leaving!"", then stomped out of the building. The boyfriend soon followed her and started calling out to her to resolved the issue. Don't know what happened next, but not relevant.

-

**Patrice O'Neal**: *""What will you do when she takes the pussy hostage and puts a gun to it's head?""*

-

When a girl starts walking away from you, don't chase. When she announces the infamous, *""I'm leaving""*, she's really saying *""I, the beholder of the pussy and my vaginal affections are exiting!""* She's saying, *""Chase me so I feel validated about the power I hold over you!""* That's exactly what it this scenic act was about: ego, power, and validation.

-

If you try to get her not to leave, you fluff her ego and decrease the tingles. Let her stomp off like a child and blow off some steam. It's hard when she's an LTR and you have put in emotional investment, but that's when it matters the most.  Understand that women need these moments of emotional spikes to feel alive. She NEEDS them for her own good. 

-

""Go kick rocks, bitch"" should be your attitude. If she's being ridiculous, be the first to withdraw by telling her to go away if she wants to continue acting the way she is. Big chance she doesn't, because the point of her leaving was to compel you to grovel and have the situation in her [frame](https://archive.fo/QCnET). She can't frame her exit this way if you initiate it. That would be a defeat. Doesn't matter if you were her ride, that's her problem. She can call an Uber or a friend or parent or some beta chump sitting around. Doesn't even matter if she exits the car (bonus points if you stop on the side and kick her out, not accepting pseudo last minute apologies). Don't be like Kelso was with Jackie in [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXRSVvsOg8g). And never initiate contact! Don't keep an eye on her, especially if she starts talking to another guy (she's just doing it to make you jealous and fluff her ego). 

-

I guarantee if you don't chase her or contact her, she'll do one of these things:

 * **A)** Come straight back. You called her bluff.

 * **B)** Say sorry (especially if you told her to leave)

In case A, remain dismissive and show no affection. No apology (especially if didn't do anything wrong you pussy). In case B, if you have deemed this event as a reconcilable offense, make her wait before you respond. Don't discuss the matter in any detail or try to explain your side of the story in an attempt to garner sympathy (she doesn't care about you, she cares about the validation). In either case, you must make her work to return to your good graces, else she won't respect it. 

-

 * **C)** She'll taunt you some more by shifting the blame on you. She'll consider your indifference to her absence as evidence of the 'crime' of not 'caring about the relationship', and attempt to get you to accept liability.

-

This is psy-ops. Don't fall for it. Even if you were somewhat in the wrong, NEVER accept a woman's frame. *EVER*. 

-

>**My Story**: I remember a night with an old girlfriend where she did something to piss me off at the mall. I instantly became cold towards her and we left. Didn't speak to her in the car. She started looking to me for signs of validation in the corner of my eye with puppy dog eyes, a slight frown, and a submissive posture.  Didn't speak to her in the car. I had to get something from the store, didn't speak to her in the store much. We were in separate aisles. By then I had cooled down and we ran into each other in another aisle. I just slowly walked toward her without saying anything and hugged her. Then we walked out the store without me saying anything or showing affection. When we got in the car, she apologized and had some tears. I just put my hand on her leg and said, *""shhhh""*. The conversation eventually turned a little humorous and we kissed. It was the most passionate kiss I ever received from her. She was more kind and affectionate than usual for the next couple days. That was our first 'conflict'. Not exactly as described earlier, but close enough.

-

Make-up sex is often the best sex. At the end of an emotional roller coaster, is wet pussy. The the cycle of drama brings catharsis. This is where *""treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen""* comes from. This is why girls 'stay with' (continue to have sex with) boyfriends that treat them badly. 

-

----------------

-

**4)** A girl threatening or implying the end of the relationship

-
**Read**: [By the time you have 'the talk', she's already packed and planned her exit](https://archive.fo/lKkgP)

-

---------------

-

**5)** Overt communication

-

Women are not like men, they communicate their intentions covertly. When a woman blatantly discusses her intentions or sexual topics, it's a trap or a shit test.

-  She puts up impenetrable LMR. You get frustrated and go cold and do something else. Then she says, ""are you mad because I wouldn't have sex with you?""

-

There are other examples I can't quite put my finger on, but I think you get the idea. Explicitly stating the unspoken dynamic is not what women do. 

-

edit: **What to do**: Ignore and pretend it never happened. ""No it's fine, I'm not gonna pressure into doing anything you don't wanna do."" Play it cool. Just lay down. Some convo. Then say what you need to say to exit or have her leave in a non-butthurt manner. Nothing you can do. Never mention previous ASD. Just sounds butthurt, spirals down a path of no tingles, and activates more ASD. Never remind a woman why she denied sex to you. 

-

------------

-

**6)** Claims she is in some kind of danger

-

**Example**: An ex-gf of mine was at the mall ~40 mins away. She sent a text ""I think these guys are following me"". I then instantly gave her advice on how to handle it and to call me if she needs help. Revenge fantasies flowed through my mind, what I would do to guys who'd try to hurt her. She then instantly said, ""no it's okay. but thanks. It's nothing I can't handle."" 

-

This was pre-meditated. She just wanted her ego boosted by seeing me willing to come to her rescue. There could have been no men at all, she just made it up. The details of her story aren't important, just the outcome. 

-

-

**7)** Pseudo displays of sexual receptivity (attention whoring)

-

* **Example:** I was at the bar section of a venue. Down by the pool tables were two girls (early 20's). They had this hot-slut look. High boots and uggs. Skinny jeans wrapped around their big posteriors and up on the hips. Mid-section exposed below shirt. Makeup. Earrings. Rings. Necklace. Can't really explain the 'slut look'. They walked towards one particular table. One girl leans back, using the table as support.The other in front of her. They begin grinding on each other aggressively with considerable space from everyone else. They tried to make it look like they were 'just having girl fun, woooohooooo!'. At the end of this erotic display, they returned to the group they came with like nothing happened. They spoke loudly. They flirted with nobody their entire stay, not even the guys with them. 

-

Attention whoring, that's all that was. All they wanted was for men to stare at them. [That validation alone satisfied them](http://archive.is/GspuI). If you were to try to hit on them, you'd fail. They continuously pranced from one side of the bar to the other as a duo. Always quick on the move, flighty, and loud with each other as if trying to have their presence known. At one of their brief stops that just so happen to be in my vicinity, I over heard a conversation with them. One of the sluts was talking about the relief and delight she felt hearing that her baby daddy was going to be released from prison in a few months. Supposedly, he was incarcerated for shooting somebody. 

-

I've only known one guy who can keep these types of girl's attention (the guy mention in 'No. 1, Example B').  He has mastered the art of loud clown game at bars that draws the attention whores to him. He will dress provocatively via peacocking, will ante up the girls high energy, and become the center of attention instead of the hot women, basically the guy version of what the girls were doing, but better than them. He gets off on the whole bar scene, loves it for the sake of it, women or no women. It's his element like a fish in water. It comes off natural. They can only get attention because of their pussy, he gets it because they think he's the fun guy, thus is worth more. These women can't beat an attention competitor, so they try to join him, or rather attach themselves to him. 

-

These women's display of attention seeking acts (dance, loud talk, and walking all over the place) create an illusion of immediate receptiveness. False. This is a chump trap. The barrier to entry is quite high. If you're not Mr. Baby Daddy People Shooter or my friend Mr Clown Game Master, you're not getting any action. Promise.

Don’t be fooled, [you still need game to bang sluts](http://archive.is/jU0Rd)

**8)** 'Rapport Bombing'

Women are selfish. Women will take a perfectly good conversation and intentionally sabotage it for feelz. If you follow her down this path, you'll get no lady-hole. Anticipate it so you're not caught off guard. Not *""whoa, wtf""*, but *""oh boy, here we go. How can I maneuver around this back to sexy-time?""*

-

 * **Example A**: I was at a college hitting on some milf going back to school. The vibe was happy, conversation was going good until she decided to talk about how her husband passed away... and talked about it for several sentences though I tried to change the subject. It wasn't appropriate based on the topics of discussion. 

-

* **Example B**: Claims to have been raped, abused, or molested in the past (especially when 'unprovoked'). 

-

Real rape and molesting victims usually feel great shame, often times not even sharing it with the family. If that really happened to her, do you think that would come up as a casual part of a conversation with some guy she doesn't know well? Especially in a causal manner? Never. This is some *#MeToo bullshit. All rape allegations should be assumed false until proven otherwise. Women have abused this too much. If she never filed a police report, don't take it seriously. 

-

**What to do**: For both of these examples, always pause for a second. ""Hmmm."" and maybe a ""that sucks"", then gradually change the subject. Never let something emotionally negative from a woman phase you. Often times it's bullshit or is insignificant. But do keep in mind women like to get the feelz running for feelz-sake. It's not a bug, it's a feature. It's a woman thing. No way around that. 

-

 * Side Note: If a girl starts talking about boring shit, remember getting up and walking away without warning is a viable option. Don't let women waste your time. Don't be a [time-ho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9QOQNcpuiA). 

 * Side Note 2: Opie and Anthony w/ Patrice O'Neal (only ones with Patrice), [CultofBlackPhillip](https://www.youtube.com/user/CultOfBlackPhillip/videos) (Patrice O'Neal), [Beige Phillip Show](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheBeigePhillip/videos) (Dante Nero, award winning male stripper)... Just listen to them on youtube. To you newbs, these two are TRP legendary.

[Here's the thread](http://archive.is/Fdi6w).

Characters in the story: the hamster (32F), her ex-husband (33M) and his new girlfriend (26F).


Husband focused on career, while wife stayed at home caring for his son. She had no hobbies nor friends, was overweight and became less attractive as she hit the wall, and being home alone, she was feeling lonely (probably cheated on her husband occasionally) while husband was working his ass off to provide for family.

The husband stayed faithful, yet to her that wasn't perfect, she wanted him to leave his job(?) to spend more time with her, yet had the husband did so, she'd have left him after a while because he'd no longer be providing her and their kid with quality life, and would have turned into a loser just like she is.

Instead of appreciating the quality life and supporting husband in his career, she gave him drama and **initiated** the divorce.

Hooked the husband on child support (she wouldn't mention facts like this, because that's not good for her self-image) was banging random dudes she'd have found online (very easy for a woman to get laid and get that instant gratification from attention/sex), then after realizing she lost a man with very high SMV, and there are slim chances of getting another one now, she regretted her decision and wants him back.


But unfortunately for her, the husband moved on, found himself a pretty, fit 26 y/o girl with a positive attitude.

Had the husband became miserable and turned into a loser alcoholic, she wouldn't have wanted him back, and rationalized her decision to divorce him as ""right"".

Remember, women will rationalize whatever they want so long as it benefits them.

In this case, she became the victim of her own stupidity. If you're at a point in life, when your SO gives you shit/or your wife divorces you, with little care to your ""feelings"". Just remember, that the best revenge is to get more successful than you currently are, get higher SMV, nothing grinds hamster wheels harder than seeing the man they dumped becoming a better person in the future.

Whatever. Dudes will flirt. I'm standing there, lightly grilling him on his nerdy cashmere sweater, not really paying him mind. However, I notice my girl starts making heavy eye contact with him. At one point, he's holding out this peppermint candy to her, asking, ""You want it?"" My girl says: **""Feed it to me.""** While looking him dead in the eyes. There was no mistake: it was seductive af. I also noticed she was lightly running her fingertips up his stomach/torso. 

At this point, I grab her HARD by the forearm, yank her over to the side, and say, **""Do NOT fucking disrespect me like that. Ever.""** ""Do you want me to walk on you?"" etc. Suddenly, flirty-boy's posse  steps up and they're like, ""Don't touch her yo."" ""Why you being rough with her?"" etc. 

I tell them to mind their business and they back off. I'm fucking pissed, so, I storm off to the staircase (the balcony at this bar was upstairs). My friends are downstairs ordering drinks. 
I find them and prepare to leave as my girl's coming up behind me. I'm completely ignoring her and she's crying. We're starting to walk out and she's getting increasingly hysterical, shouting at me, saying, ""You have no idea how much I've given up for you! I cut off everyone!""

We continue walking down the street; her yelling and crying, me ignoring her, my friends awkwardly walking ahead of us. At one point I start splitting off in the other direction from her, to head to my friend's house, and she goes: ""FINE!"" 

*Not even 10 seconds later she comes running back up to me. Pleading.* **""I can't do this""** she sobs.

Eventually she gets really fucking hysterical (especially after I told her to fuck off) and at this point it's a legit *scene*. We're standing in the goddamn pouring rain and she's yelling and crying, her fucking makeup running everywhere. Repeating the same excuses over and over. She's saying sorry, and yet, also proclaiming she ""doesn't remember"" and ""doesn't know what she did."" 

Anyways. That night was the 1st time she told me she loves me. Neither of us had said it before over the 8 months we've been seeing each other (and we did have an LTR for a short period). 

Did I overreact here? From my retelling of the story it may sound like it, but all I did was swiftly reprimand her then ignore her. The other 80% of the time was her meltdown.

#Tired of seeing posts on here shitting all over Tinder. If you do it right there is no easier way to meet women in my opinion. The ones shitting on it are the ones not having any success. I've been successful at Tinder(and Bumble) for the past couple of years and let me show you how I do it. 

I know a lot of Tinder guides have been posted here before, but here is my take on how to have success.

-----------

#Step 0 - Understand The Ultimate Maxim of Tinder

**IF YOU ARE NOT GETTING MATCHES, ITS BECAUSE YOUR PICTURES SUCK.** 100% of the time this is the case. It's not Tinder screwing you, its not Tinder trying to get you to pay for its Plus/Gold features, its not shallow women, its not women only on there for validation, its not a glitch, its not anything but the fact that your pictures are ass. Keep this in mind when you inevitably see someone shit on Tinder in the comments of this post or elsewhere on TRP. 

-------

#Step 1 - Understand The Tinder ELO System and how it works

Basically Tinder uses an ELO rating system to ""rate"" each account to judge how attractive the account is based on their swiping and how they get swiped. Obviously, if your profile gets swiped right a lot, you'll have a higher rating, and vice versa. It's not just how people swipe you that determines your rating, but also how picky you are. If you are swiping right on everything, your rating will go down because when you do that you are swiping right on low rated profiles. If you are pickier and only swipe right on higher rated profiles, you'll have a chance for a better score, assuming you are getting swiped right a lot as well. To learn more about how the ELO rating system works mathematically, check out http://archive.is/O07Ad

**TLDR, your Tinder ELO score is determined on the rating/quality of profiles swiping right on you, and the rating/quality of profiles you are swiping right on.**

--------

#Step 2 - Know your competition

One thing I recommend doing, if you have the time, is creating a burner Facebook account as a woman. Use it to make a Tinder account and select that you are interested in men. This way you can scroll through the profiles to see the men you will be competing with in your area. 

A general theory of Tinder is that for brand new accounts, you get a ""noob boost"", which means they are going to show you the higher ELO rated Tinder accounts first, and your profile will also be put toward the top of other user's stacks so they don't have to scroll through many profiles before seeing yours. This doesn't mean every single Tinder account in your stack that you scroll through will be high rated, because remember, there will also be new accounts in your initial stack who are also being boosted, many of which will suck.

Why am I mentioning this noob boost? Because you can use this to scout your competition. The profiles you will be seeing when you do this are generally the profiles the attractive women will be seeing. That way you know what you need to do to beat the competition. 

For the sake of this post I went ahead and did this for my area(medium sized city in the Southern United States). I scrolled through the first 100 male profiles and gave each profile a rating on picture quality(1 being shit, 5 being top tier) and attractiveness(1 being ugly, 5 being top tier) and then I flagged an account if they were not lean.

Settings: Age 18-32, 30 mile radius.

Results: 

* Of the 100 profiles, only 3 of them had what I considered top tier pictures. Most were shitty selfies, bad quality pictures that had grainy or fuzziness in them, bad lighting, or bad poses. Lots of crappy gym selfies and mirror selfies. The average picture quality rating was 1.866 out of 5. That's bad, and shows you don't really need to do much to have better pictures than the rest.

* The average attractiveness rating was a 2.1, not much higher than the picture quality number. And this is supposedly contains the best profiles? I think a lot of the profiles I saw were ""noob boost"" profiles, no way they would be high rated. Either way, I only handed out a ""5"" to 4 profiles, that's 4%, and only handed out a 4 to 3 profiles. That means out of 100, only 7 were what I considered attractive enough profiles a woman would swipe right on.

* 65 of the 100 profiles were not lean, 51 were overweight, and 32 were obese. Once again, shows how much impact being lean has. 

* Average age was 20.9, but the average age of the profiles I gave a 3 or higher to was 24.6. Older guys seem to have a better grasp on this.

**Moral of this story? You really don't have a high bar to clear when it comes to having a top tier Tinder profile. Most guys Tinder profiles suck ass. All you need are good quality photos and to be lean to beat most Tinder profiles out there. Unless Tinder only shows the highest rated accounts to accounts who already have a proven high ELO score and still hides them even from noob boost accounts.**

--------

#Step 3 - Yes, being attractive matters

This is an app where people judge you on apperance. You think looks don't matter? They absolutely do. I am not saying this app is worthless for you if you are below a 7/10 in looks, but you have to reel in your expectations. Women on these apps are pickier than they are in real life, so if you are a 5/10, don't go in expecting to match with 8s or higher. 

Before dismissing Tinder and other apps all together, try to max out your looks first. Lose weight, get lean, lift, dress well, wear the right accessories, sport a good haircut/hairstyle, have a good facial care/skin care routine, and all of that. Doing all of this + taking good pictures will go a long way and can add points to your attractiveness. 

----------

#Step 4 - Pictures are 90% of the battle

I repeat the Ultimate Tinder Maxim: **IF YOU ARE NOT GETTING MATCHES, YOU HAVE BAD PICTURES. PERIOD.**

You are going to sink or swim by your pictures, specifically, the quality of your pictures. Period. I consider myself an attractive man, but I failed at Tinder at first because my pictures sucked. Even if you are attractive, if you have shitty pictures, you are doomed. When I finally put some good pictures on my profile, it was night and day the number of matches and interest I was getting. It became like shooting fish in a barrel. I even got reported to Tinder as a catfish because women thought I was ripping my pictures from models and wasn't who I was in the pictures. 

Now the term ""good pictures"" can mean so many different things. From my experience, here are the elements that make up good quality pictures:

* Picture quality - There is a difference between a shitty cell phone front camera picture and a picture coming from a DSLR or expensive camera. This does matter. Front facing cell phone cameras generally have bad quality, bad apertures, bad lenses, and distort your face. The clearer and less grainy the picture, the better. 

* Lighting - Lighting matters. Pictures taken in the dark will suck because they will have high ISO settings, meaning more grainy. Pictures taken using indoor lighting often cast unnatural shadows with harsher lighting. Pictures taken with a camera flash add 7 years to your face and create all kinds of bad shadows and unappealing flashback. The best lighting is outdoors. The problem with outdoor photos is that generally the sun will be too bright, causing too many harsh shadows, overexposure and your eyes to squint. One solution is to take pictures when its cloudy. Or you can take pictures in the shade(but beware of surrounding glare that causes you to squint). The best time to take outdoor pictures is an hour after sunrise or before sunset, known as the golden hour. You can google ""Golden Hour Calculator"" to determine what time exactly this is for your location. During the golden hour you can take good pictures with soft, golden lighting and yet its not bright enough to cast bad shadows or make you squint. If you are wearing sunglasses it doesn't matter what time of day you take outdoor pics, but generally you don't want to have more than 1 or 2 pics in your Tinder picture album with sunglasses.

* Setting - Where you take your pictures matter. A computer selfie at your desk in your room = shit. A picture of you outdoors somewhere interesting = good. The key here is variety. When I was doing the burner account competition check earlier, most guys are bad when it comes to variety of their settings. Find unique outdoor places to go to. One of my favorite is the roof of a parking garage downtown on weekends. There is no one up there, I don't have to pay to get in, and you get a badass view of the downtown skyline in the background. Parks, hiking trails, mountains, lakes, beaches, rivers, etc. all work. You can also be creative and get shots on the sidewalks, streets, etc. 

* Pose and Posture - You want your poses to be natural based on the setting your picture is taken. If you are taking a picture on a sidewalk, you obviously don't want your pose to be as if you are posing for the camera, you want your pose to be as if you were walking down the sidewalk. Go to YouTube and look up modeling poses for inspiration. And make sure to have good posture whatever pose you use.

* Facial Expression - The key here is variety. You don't want all your photos to be of you smiling into the camera. You don't want all of your photos to be of you looking away from the camera with your mouth closed and a serious expression. I go with the rule of halves here. You want half of your pictures to be smiling, half not smiling. Then half of your pictures looking into the camera, and half looking away. 

* Composition - Where you are placed in the frame matters a lot. You see a lot of guys fail at this when checking out the competition. In my opinion there are only 2 acceptable compositions: Half body shots, and full body shots. Half body shots are generally shots from the waist or upper thigh up, full body has your entire body in the frame. But that is only half the battle - you don't want much open space between the top and bottom of the frame. Use the entire frame. [This is a good example of what I mean in a full body shot, the concept for a half body shot is the same.](http://www.elevatephotography.co.uk/image-view/whole-body-shot) Notice how the whole frame is used, not much gap above his head or below his shoes. [Now here is an example of a bad full body shot - notice how much empty space there is above his head and below his feet.](http://www.photo4design.com/stock-photo-full-body-shot-of-teenage-guy-66071) You want to avoid face only shots because they just aren't flattering and will hide your body, which you want to show off if you are lean, and also hides your fashion, which leads me to: 

*  Fashion/Style - Your clothing choices matter and can greatly enhance your overall look if done right. You want your pictures to show off a diverse variety of well fitting stylish clothes. FIT is the key, more than style. They both greatly matter, but bad fit will ruin any style. A good style can't overcome bad fit. Go shopping to stores like J Crew and wear the smallest size you can that still fits, in a slim style cut if you can find it. Some good ideas for clothes to wear: Dark Wash Slim Jeans, Slim Chino Pants(Khaki is my favorite color), Flat Front Chino Shorts at 9 inch inseam or less, Slim Fit Casual Button Down Shirts, Polos, Well Fitting T-Shirts, Denim Button Downs, Denim Jackets, Bomber Jackets, Leather Jackets, Slim Dress Shirts, Nice Sweaters, Watches(you need to wear one in every photo), boots, dress shoes, loafers, nice sneakers, necklaces, pendants, and bracelets. NO - Cargo Shorts, Cargo Pants, tennis shoes, basketball shoes, ""skater"" shoes, flip flops/sandals, baggy clothes, hats, sweats, hoodies, logo or graphic shirts. You need to be wearing a wristwatch in all your pictures.

* Hair - Make sure you put some effort into it, whatever you do. Find a good haircut/hairstyle for your face shape. 

* Pets - If you have a dog, probably a good idea to have a dog pic. 

* Motorcycle - If you have one, probably a good idea to have a pic of you on your bike

#Step 5 - How to actually go about taking good pictures

So I stated what makes a good picture. But how do you actually do it? There are 3 ways I recommend, all of which are viable and have their pros and cons.

**The Friend With a Camera Approach**

Find a friend to go along with you with a camera and have him/her take pictures of you in various places or settings. Ideally you'll want a friend with a good camera who knows a thing or two about how to take good pictures. Or you could go on Craigslist or something and hire a professional photographer but that can be a bit pricey.

Pros: Lots of possibilities, someone else controlling the camera means you don't have to set and forget the photo settings or placement, good for getting shots at busy places with lots of people without creating a distraction or scene(think downtown locations), cheapest approach

Cons: Less creative control over the pictures, can only be done when friend is available and in that certain time frame, not everyone has a friend who is available or willing to do this. 

**The Tripod Approach**

This is where you buy a tripod to go with whatever camera you are using, set up the tripod and take pictures. I do have a nice camera and a tripod, and have used this approach, but it can be difficult to get right even though I have a remote controller for it because with nicer cameras, it's most ideal to have someone behind the camera to fine tune the controls for every shot.

Pros: Don't need someone else, can do everything on your own time, allows for unique locations to be shot

Cons: Can be expensive, not ideal for high traffic places, tripod can be unstable and knocked over by things like wind, some locations there isn't an ideal place to put the tripod, even with a timer or remote controller it can be difficult to get the right photo settings in terms of shutter speed, aperture and focus

**The Drone Approach**

This is personally the approach I have used over the past year to amazing results. Obviously, drones aren't cheap, but they are worth the investment. Not only can you get some good photos from some unique angles and take them anywhere, but it also gives you a fun hobby as well on the side. I've used both the DJI Spark and DJI Mavic Air drone for this. Both have good cameras, and even better, they have an interval setting meaning it will take a picture every 2 seconds. Meaning 30 pictures a minute. DJI Spark battery lasts about 12 minutes, and DJI Mavic Air lasts about 16-18 minutes. That means you can get 360-480 pictures per battery. Tell me you can't find at least one good picture? You can find a DJI Spark new for $350-$400 in stores or on eBay used for cheaper. Just make sure you get a quality drone, DJI is a good brand. The cheap $50-$100 drones you can get at Wal-Mart won't cut it. 

Pros: Don't need another person, can get all kinds of unique angles/settings/locations you can't get with a tripod, can be controlled remotely, good picture quality once you get the settings right

Cons: Loud, not ideal at all for use amongst places with a lot of traffic/people so you have to find more isolated places, some locations are restricted for drone use, takes a while to learn how to dial in the photo settings like ISO, shutter speed and exposure value that flatter you the most, expensive

**All 3 of these approaches are viable. But one of these 3 approaches have to be used if you want to have top tier photos. Getting your cell phone camera, leaning it up against something, setting the timer and running into place isn't going to cut it. Outstretched arm selfies won't cut it. Cropped group pics won't cut it. Mirror pics won't cut it. Yes, it takes time and effort, and for some of the approaches, investment, but it pays off. Do you want to succeed or not?**

-------

#Step 6 - To shirtless ab pic or not to shirtless ab pic?

From my experience, you can go either way. If you have a shitty body, are skinny or fat, and have no defined abs and vascularity, it won't work. If you have a good body with defined muscles, vein vascularity and a 6 pack, it won't hurt to have a shirtless picture in there. It's not always ideal, though. There *are* girls who will swipe left when they see a shirtless picture no matter what. I've found that shirtless pics work better when you are looking for hookups, not so much when you are looking for dating/something longer term. 

If you want to use a shirtless pic, there is one rule: **IT HAS TO LOOK CANDID.** Shirtless mirror bathroom pic = NO. Shirtless gym selfie = NO. If it looks like you are posing for the picture, and therefore it was planned, its not going to work. It has to look like it was taken candidly, unplanned, as if you were doing something, and someone happened to take a picture of you. The shirtless picture I had the most success with was one of me at the park holding a football, I made it look like I was playing football, even though I was there by myself and used my drone to take the picture. However, I made it come across as extremely candid, even though my 6 pack and vein vascularity and muscles were showing off. Shirtless pics at the beach or pool also work. 

---------

#Step 7 - Post Processing/Editing

You don't want to just use the pictures as they are. You want to find your best ones and then edit them. Use editing software(Adobe Lightroom is good, the stock Windows photo software is good, I am sure iPhoto is good) to mess around with the pictures. Apply filters, change the brightness/contrast/clarity/saturation, and all of that. The key is to not go overboard with the filters and everything. You still want it to look natural. The editing will add to your photo, not make your photo. Women will know if your picture is edited too much. Edit it in a way where it looks a lot better than the original, but at the same time you can't tell it was actually edited. 

---------

#Step 8 - Selecting Which Pictures to Use

The generally key, as I have already stated, is variety. You want your 6 pictures to give a well rounded perspective of who you are.  Variety in terms of poses, facial expressions, outfits, and locations. 

Obviously you want to pick your 6 most flattering pictures. The best approach to use is to pick 6 locations and outfits and take a shit ton of pictures at all 6. Then pick the best from each group and there are your 6. 

Your lead picture needs to be your best one. It needs to clearly show your face and your body, uncovered eyes(no sunglasses) with clothes on(no shirtless pics as your lead), by yourself(no group pics). Your last picture also needs to be a good one, as if a girl is swiping through your pics, will be her last impression before she decides to swipe right or left on you. Remember, she will judge you by your worst pic. 

I'm not going to post my profile, but here is a breakdown of my pictures:

* 4 of 6 I am smiling

* 3 of 6 I am looking at the camera

* 2 of 6 I am wearing sunglasses

* 5 of 6 are full body shots, head to toe

* All are taken outside

* No shirtless pics that I am currently using

* 2 of 6 I am wearing flat front chino shorts, 2 of 6 I am wearing jeans, 1 of 6 I am wearing khaki chinos, 1 of 6 I am wearing dress pants

* 2 of 6 I am wearing a v neck t-shirt, 3 of 6 I am wearing a casual button down shirt with the sleeves rolled up, 1 of 6 I am wearing a dress shirt with a tie

* 2 of 6 were taken in broad daylight(both sunglasses pics), 3 of 6 taken at sunset in the golden hour, 1 of 6 taken in broad daylight but in the shade

* Locations Used: Beach Sand, Downtown Sidewalk, Work(Outside), Top Level of Downtown Parking Garage, Football Field, Side of Building

* Poses Used: Sitting on Cooler, Leaning Against Pole, Leaning Against Wall, Walking With Football in Hand, Standing Straight Up Smiling Into the Camera, Looking Over Shoulder

* No Group Pics or pics with others. Group pics are overrated. Yes, it shows you having fun with friends, but generally they are not flattering and the cropping you have to do ruins the quality. I'd rather have 100% control over my pictures from start to finish. If your pictures are good enough she won't give a shit if you are alone in all of them. 

----------

#Step 9 - Your bio. Does it even matter?

In general, your bio doesn't matter. She really only looks at your pictures which are all that matter. If your pictures are good enough, then she might glance at your profile just to make sure you are a real person. 

Your bio will not help you at all. It can only hurt you. Since you have all to lose and nothing to gain, you need to keep your bio short and to the point. If you are over 6 feet tall, list your height. If you are 5'10, say you are 6 feet. Put where you are from, what part of town you live in, and about 3 or 4 things you like to do. Put the college you graduated from if you have graduated. If you have a cool job, put it in there, otherwise be either really vague with it or don't put it in there at all.

Example Profile that works: ""6'1, from New York, living here in Florida in West Miami. Ohio State '13. Fishing, traveling, fitness, and more.""

There. That's all you really need. Nothing in there that will scare anyone away or devalue you, but makes you look like a real person. Don't try to put anything witty or funny or out there. Just keep it simple. 

----------

#Step 10 - Deploying your Profile and Using Tinder

Don't set up your profile until you are absolutely ready to start with your full profile because once you set up your profile you are put in others stacks. If you already have an account, delete it so you can start over. Upload your pictures, write your bio, and where you go from here is up to you.

**Swiping**

Be picky. Only swipe right on girls that you are certain are who they are in their profile. If she only has face shots, chances are she is fat. Remember the rule: ""If you got it, flaunt it"". Girls live by this. If they have a good body, they will show it off. If they have good tits or ass, it will be shown off. If it looks like they are hiding something, they are. Read her profile, don't just look at her pics. Chances are you might like her pics, but then you look at her profile and it will state she is a single mom. Generally, if you have been swiping a while and have reached the point of the stack where all the girls are ugly, and then you come across one that is hot, chances are she is either a bot or single mom. Because legit hot girls who aren't single moms or don't have major red flags will never be that far down the stack. 

Being picky also helps your ELO score, which increases your chances of being shown at the top of the stacks of the more attractive women. 

**Super Likes**

There are two trains of thought on Super Likes. One train is that its good, it will make her think longer about you. The other train is that its creepy and too much and shows her you are already too interested. 

My take? Use them. I've had more good than bad from super likes. Not only that, but using a Super Like automatically puts you at the top of her stack, so you know you will be seen next time she logs on. Unless you have Tinder Gold, you only get one per day so use wisely. 

**Tinder Gold**

I am a fan. I only recommend, however, using this on a month by month basis. I think its a good investment to use your first month. The queue which shows who has liked you is helpful and will help you gauge how good your pictures are. If its not filling up you have shitty pictures. Also the quality of girls liking you will also help you see what type of women is finding you attractive. Lastly it helps because it helps you ground yourself to reality. A lot of girls don't log into Tinder that much, so by seeing who has already liked you, you won't get your hopes up for girls in the stack who may or may not be active(Tinder hides profiles inactive more than 2 weeks). 

If you are successful at Tinder I think its worth it to stay on Gold after your first month. I do. The passport feature is useful for traveling, as you can arrange meetups with girls before you even get there. This is just my opinion though. If you aren't successful, paying for Gold won't make you successful. The best way I can describe Tinder Gold is that its a valet for an already successful Tinder user, it just makes it easier. Seeing who has already liked you might sound like something you don't really need or need to pay for, and while I agree, its actually been more beneficial than I realized. 

**Boosts**

Regardless of whether or not you subscribe to Gold, I think everyone needs to try a boost at least once. A boost puts you at the top of the stack for everyone in your area for 30 minutes. This means you will be seen by everyone who logs on during that time. I get matches regardless but each time I boost it seems like I get a lot more. Boosts help because after a while, unless your ELO score is good, you fall farther and farther down the stacks of other girls Tinder stacks, and you won't be seen. Instead all she will see are high ELO accounts and new accounts getting their noob boost. Women swipe a lot less profiles than men do(since the attractive ones will match with almost everyone they swipe right on) so its vital to make sure you are showing up at the top of stacks. 

Timing is important with boosts. From my experience, Wednesday at 7:15pm is the best time to use it. This is ideal because its before the weekend before plans are set. If you use it on Friday or Saturday girls already have plans. 

You get a free boost every month if you have gold, otherwise its $4 each.

**Bots**

Obvious bot accounts are obvious. Their pictures are often cropped and low quality but of really attractive women in generic poses/settings. Their bios are often empty or extremely generic. And they often only have either 1, 3 or 4 pictures exactly. They are pretty easy to spot. 

**Instagram/Snapchat Follower Farmers, Sugar Daddy Seekers and Venmo Scams**

You'll see girls on here who are clearly only doing it to rope in instagram/snapchat followers, or find a sugar daddy, or get money sent to them via Venmo. 

Here is my take on them. Yes, that is what they are doing. However, for the right guy, they will throw that away. Use the Brad Pitt test here. If she saw Brad Pitt had matched with her on Tinder, you think she would just try to use him for Venmo money or to get an Instagram follow out of him? No way. 

If you think you are attractive enough, go for it anyway. Generally these girls obviously fishing for Instagram Followers or Venmo money should be massive red flags automatically disqualifying them from anything above plate material, but its possible to bust through the massive shit test. I've done it multiple times. 

-----------

#Step 11 - You've matched, now what?

So you have matched. Ideally with multiple women. 

As successful as I am at this, I would still say only about 10% of women message me first(and many women who message you first will be bots if you were unable to detect them prior to swiping). You are going to have to do the initiation. 

Fuck that shit about message timing, when to message her, etc. ""If I message her too soon after matching she will think I am desperate!"" No. Just message her when you feel like it. 

The key to an opener is to be different, set the frame, use her name, and play on her emotions. I've watched girls use tinder before and pretty much every guy either opens them with a boring ""Hey"" or ""Hi"", or uses some really stupid cheesy pick up or sexual opener that is just awkward. None of that is different, none of it sets the frame in the guy's court, and none of it plays on her emotions in a positive way.

It has to be organic. Review her profile and pictures, and try to craft a message based on that. Don't compliment her physically(i.e. you're hot or you're cute), don't get sexual in the first message, or use a dumb pick up line. 

Here is an example I used recently that worked. It was a profile of a nurse who said she worked the overnight shift and lets say her name was Anna.

>""Anna, are you a Waffle House or IHOP kind of girl? Since I am guessing those are the 2 places I would have to choose from to take you with that schedule...""

See what I did here? I did a lot of things. I set the frame as one that I will be taking her out(not necessarily to Waffle House or IHOP). I crafted the message organically based on her profile, and I made her laugh with the Waffle House/IHOP reference since those places are pretty sketchy in the AM hours, but people secretly love those places. I also gave her a reason to respond.

Here is another example of a girl who had a picture of her bowling, lets say her name was Tina:

>""Tina, if we go on a bowling date, I am not letting you use the bumpers, so you better learn how to bowl without them""

Again, I set the frame from the first message to one that I would be taking her out without asking her out. I teased her about her bowling skills and gave her a reason to respond(to defend her bowling skills). We did go on a bowling date when all was said and done. 

**It's a numbers game**

You are going to have girls who don't respond. You are going to have girls who unmatch. You are going to have girls who take forever to respond. You are going to have girls who are just not into it even if they respond. It's really a numbers game. The more girls you open, the better chances you have at least one who goes through with it all. Don't get hung up on any one girl. Assume every girl you match with will ghost you. Assume every girl you talk to will eventually stop. Assume every girl who gives you her number and you set up a date/meet with will flake. Don't get invested. Persistence is the key. 

I think this is where most guys get discouraged and come here to write their **OMG TINDER IS SHIT** posts. They have shitty pics, and only match with 1 or 2 girls, have no abundance, and when it doesn't work out with those 1 or 2 girls whether they don't respond, stop responding, flake, etc. they act like Tinder is shit and all women on there are shit. You have to remain persistent. Keep in mind the better you look, the better your pics are, the more attractive you are and better your text game is, the less likely she will flake, and the more likely she will respond and follow through. I can attest to that. Remember that girls have dozens of matches and are only going to bother with their best ones. 

---------

#Step 12 - When to ask for her number/ask her out?

So you have had a successful opener and started a conversation. When do you escalate to get her number or arrange a date/meet up?

Every girl is different, from what I have learned, so there is no one size fits all plan. Some girls want more rapport and chit chat before they are comfortable giving you their number or setting up a date. Others require less. Regardless, you need to at least try to get a number or set up a date in 5-6 messages or less. Remember, she has dozens of matches, with guys who are farther along the process than you probably are, so you have to shit or get off the pot eventually. Plus she will get bored if you don't go after what you want. 

The best way to do it is to have the conversation naturally flow into you asking for her number or asking her out. Here is an example that I used, of a girl who actually messaged me first:

>Her: Hey! How was your weekend?

>Me: Pretty good. You?

>Her: Nothing too exciting lol. Lots of work.

>Me: Well we need to fix the nothing too exciting part. Let's go get some drinks, when are you free

See how I took her response and turned it into escalation. You already have the IOI, otherwise you wouldn't have matched, so why waste time? I did it on message #2. You need to look for the opening to make it flow naturally to asking for her number or asking her out. Sometimes that takes longer than 2 messages, but you get the idea. You don't want to go too early though, then you just come across as a player/needy/desperate. 

The worst thing you can do is just make her your pen pal and ask dozens of interview style questions without escalating. She is not an idiot, she knows what you are there for. If after 5-6 messages or so you still haven't found the opening to ask for her number or ask her out, just do it. 

---------

#Step 13 - So you've got her number and set up a date, now what?

Try to set up a date within 1-3 days of getting her number/asking her out. Anything longer she will probably flake. The only times I have successfully set up dates longer in advance is when she was out of town. 

From there you need to shut the fuck up and not contact her until the day of the date, where you confirm plans. Don't text her, don't become her penpal. All you can do at this point is hurt yourself. 

If she initiates with you and texts you, respond to be polite, but space out your responses. I'm talking, take 12+ hours to respond. I had a girl who was all over me from the time we set up a date to the time we met up, always texting me. I didn't want to be rude so I would respond, and I thought that since she was the one initiating, I was fine. Wrong. We go out and then after the date she says she ""wasn't feeling a connection"". You'll never live up to the standard you set by texting her. You have nothing to gain and everything to lose. Resist the urge to text her until you meet up. 

If she flakes, she flakes. It happens. Don't become invested. If she is truly interested she will propose a counter time. Just because she cancels doesn't mean she isn't interested. I had one cancel on me and I thought it was over and I needed to move on but she rescheduled with me. 

-----------

#Does this approach also work with Bumble?

Yes. The difference is that she will open you, so you can take her opener and play with it. That doesn't mean its any easier or harder. 

My problem with Bumble is that the userbase is smaller, and there are so many inactive profiles on there. Unlike Tinder, Bumble doesn't remove/hide profiles that are inactive. I was using Bumble and saw the profile of a girl I work with who was married a year ago. She said she hasn't logged on there since 2015. 

Also you will match with girls on Bumble and they still won't message you. Again, girls get tons of matches so they will only message the cream of the crop. Become the cream. 

The upside to Bumble is that the quality of girls are higher. 

-------------

#Conclusion and Final Thoughts

* Tinder/Bumble/Online Dating is 99% pictures. They have to be outstanding. Not good. Not great. Oustanding. How much you want to invest in getting outstanding pictures is ultimately up to you because it takes effort and time and in some cases money. Just remember. If you aren't getting matches, its your pictures. End of discussion. It's not Tinder screwing you over, its not shallow women only looking for validation, its not women having you outside of their Tinder preference settings, its not anything but your shitty ass pictures. 

* Your approach if you are looking for hookups and your approach if you are looking for something more long term has to be different. 

* It really is a numbers game. I know this sounds cliche but the more matches you get the more your odds are in favor of at least one working out. You get more matches by having good pictures and utilizing features like boost. Tinder might seem like a lost cause if you only get 5 matches and none of them work out. But if you have 50 or 500 matches you're going to have matches that work out, its the law of averages. 

* Don't get your hopes up on any one individual girl until you actually meet up with her in person. From there you apply TRP to prevent the onset of oneitis.

* Don't match with a girl unless you are 100% certain she is who she is in her pictures. Read her entire bio and look at all her pics before matching to find red flags. 

* Tinder Gold in my opinion is useful if you are already successful at Tinder, but it won't turn you from unsuccessful to successful. 

* I've seen false advice given around TRP that the opener doesn't matter, if she is attracted to you she is attracted. While attraction does matter the most, you still have to give her a reason to engage with you, invoke her emotions and set the frame. 

* Shit or get off the pot. She has dozens of matches and dozens of guys doing the same thing you are doing. If you don't make a move, another guy will. Build some short rapport and then find an opening to ask for her number/ask her out.

* There is inevitably going to be someone in the comment section saying you don't need Tinder or dating apps, all you need is day/night game, Tinder is shit. What if I told you, you could do **both**? mindblown.gif",971,4,0.31200000643730164,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first",1
8pm17w,18,8pm17w,2018-06-09T01:55:22Z,comms_num,173,top,1,TheRedPill,1051,"I met this girl in the library. English, brunette, small and very cute. Pretty face.
It's exam time and everyone's been pulling all nighters or staying up late. We were in a computer room that was pretty empty, and she kept glancing over. I saw that we were studying the same thing.

We 'studied' like that for a while but actually I was just on reddit and she was playing some kind of RPG on her mobile. It was hot.

So I walked over because she was cute as hell and approach anxiety doesn't even register anymore and as soon as she saw me her eyes lit up and then she knocked her coffee over her computer keyboard. Lol.

We studied together for a while, (we had taken the same module,) answered some exam questions, flirted quite heavily and then decided to head off because it was late. She was very cute and smiley and seemed to be enjoying herself a lot.

It was like 2am or something, she lived in the halls close by, I lived far away. I decided to walk her back to her halls, because, you know, it was 2am. She was happy about it.

We walk in the night and she brags to me about how her IQ is 170 and she's in mensa and I'm like ""whowh this girl is into me huh.""

I see her off at the front gates and then go to head home, but not wanting to pass up a sure thing, I say to her ""we should study together again, that was fun"".

She gives me her number eagerly.
___________________________

Skip to a few days later. 

I wake around 1pm to a headache, ass taste and a dry throat. Pulled an all nighter for an exam the day before and my recovery sleep seemed to have run over deep into the next day. Oops. Gotta make up for that sleep debt I guess.

The first thing I do is drink some water, take a piss, brush my damn teeth and then check my phone and see the message;

""Omw""

Oh it's the girl.

She's on her way.

On her way where?

Shit, yeah. We were 'hanging out' today. Supposed to meet at 1.30.

I check the time. Shit.

I am not ready. And I will be late.

How long can I make her wait?... Well this is directly correlated to the attractiveness of the girl. 

In this case, not very long.

I get a move on.

The house is a tip, and I anticipate maybe possibly potentially hopefully fucking this girl after, so I can't bring her back to a shithole can I?

I begin cleaning the house: airing out the smoke, beer cans, food wrappers, trading cards. Soon I have a substantial rubbish bag and am not gonna let it stink up the flat. I put on my trusty slippers, put the door on latch and head downstairs.

I head out the main downstairs door and deposit the rubbish bag in the bin and attempt to re-enter through the front door.

But I've only gone and done it haven't I.

I've locked myself out.
__________________________________________

The first thing I did was buzz the neighbours. No need to panic yet. It's the downstairs front door that's locked, the door to my flat is on latch. They only need to buzz me in and I have access.

But no one was answering. I only have 2 neighbours, the cute Asian girl that lives across from me, and a European couple above. Whenever I bring over screamers they try to match us. It's pretty fun actually.

Poor asian girl though...

Anyway she wasn't answering. And neither was the couple. Well fuck they were probably at work. Of course. Real adults have real jobs and don't sleep in until 1pm to 'study'.

I weigh up my options and variables.

I should be at the library with this girl in 20 mins.

I am, quite literally, in the clothes I slept in. Luckily for me, that entails a thick hoodie and sweats, because I save money on heating and pyjamas are for fags.

Oh and my slippers of course. However, no phone, no keys, no wallet. No current way to enter the house.

I consider scaling the building, I'm a climber... but no parkour maniac. And I don't think I was stupid enough to leave any windows open.

Fuck. I realise that this date isn't gonna happen. I'm stuck outside, completely technologically naked, with no way to contact anyone.

Missing phone anxiety begins to creep in. 

Gonna have to flake on the girl, cos I'm a damn idiot and locked myself out of the flat. A silent flake too... harsh.

Oh well. She'll probably like me more after anyway.
________________________________________________
So I decide the smartest thing to do is wait for my neighbours to get back.

Which will probably be like 6 or 7 right? That's when normal people finish their normal jobs right?

Well until then I guess I just gotta kill time.

A few years ago, I woulda stressed about a situation like this, really just got stupidly anxious. But I've read Solzhenitsyn... this... this is no big deal at all. Pretty funny actually. 

Lets make the most of it.

So I wonder down the high street in my slippers, and get looks from the people on the street. I probably look like a mess, unshowered and unshaven and in my sweats; but then I see my reflection in a shop window and I've got that whole just woke up bed-head grizzled college boy stoner look going on and I marvel for the 1000th time at how attractive I am. Thank god for lifting.

The slippers flop on the pavement, they probably will not last the day if I'm gonna be walking around. But oh well. I remember buying these slippers. Only a few weeks ago. I was in a store and I spotted them and immediately felt this ethereal feeling like they were important somehow and I needed them. The slippers damn called to me. So I bought em.

Interesting. Now I know why. Morphic Resonance after all. Or maybe just very good slipper marketing.

I sit on a bench by the river and watch the water. It's a cold day. I feel naked and unplugged, and for the first time, actually feel good about it. I had no phone or money, no internet connection, no dopamine inducing distractions, and I was alone with my thoughts and the cold air. A sudden weight lifted from the top of my head. It felt like I'd just taken a small dose of... something....

It was freeing. I realised it was going to be one of those days. I haven't had one of these in a while, and I cherish them.
_____________________________________________________
It now has to be past the time when I was supposed to meet the girl but I have no real way to tell. I meditate for a while cos the air feels good on my face and then people-watch in the park and pet a dog. I begin listing off places to visit and planning out how I'll spend the next 5 or so hours until my neighbours get back.

It's as I am walking up the highstreet that I find what I thought was an extinct species of store.

An internet cafe.

An oasis.

Shit. Pass the tourniquet I have access again.

The Pakistani guy at the desks sees me in my slippers.

""I've locked myself out. I have no money. Can I use your computer please?""

He looks at me. ""Ok. Number 5"".

Thanks bro.

I get on facebook and its 2:05 and i notice she hasnt messaged me yet. Playing it cool. Nice.

I scroll reddit and memes for a while.

Then I have an idea.

I google the number of my estate agent. They should have a spare set of keys right? Paki bro let me use his phone to call them.

The lady on the other side didn't seem happy with my shit. They couldn't help me.

Plan foiled. Waiting for the neighbours it is then.

I scroll through trp for a while. The old hambeast next to me is watching some african music video and breathing very loudly through her mouth, and she's scrolling back and watching the same 10 seconds over and over. Has been doing it the whole time.

I finally get a ""?"" From the girl.

Nice. Still playing it cool.

I make her wait for 5 mins then hit her with the:

""cant come sorry""

She says ""why""

I start to think about what I should do. But I know immediately what I'm going to do. It's one of those days after all, and I want her along for the ride.

""you could come here though""

She waits a long time before saying ""where""

I message her the name of the nearest train station. She says ""why though?"" I tell her ""lol its a surprise "".

This was obviously too much for her to bear and she texted ""ok lol coming""

Wow that worked. Maybe I have her hooked already, or maybe she's just an adventurous one. Both options are great.

I didn't really have a plan for what happens next though. But who cares, I'll make it up as I go along.

Without my phone, or my wallet, I was entirely free to just drift with no responsibilities. It felt amazing.

Frankly, it felt like I was a kid again. Playing outside during summer.

I was suddenly very excited to see her.
___________________________________________
When she arrived at the station and saw me in my slippers she gave me the goofiest smile. I could see in her eyes that she knew immediately that it will be one of those days.

""I locked myself out"" I said.

""How?!?"" She's laughing.

So I tell her the story, as we walk around town. I'm very self conscious that my breath might be bad due to the fact I actually haven't eaten anything yet, but am also thankful I am OCD about brushing my teeth as soon as I wake up.

I didn't really think about gaming her at all, I didn't analyse anything or hyperfocus on my actions. I just kinda went with it. It was fun, I was completely in the moment and just ran around the town and played with her, like a boy dog with a girl dog following him around.
It helps that she wasn't shit testing me or anything bitchy like that, made it so easy and she happily bounced along like a lil' sidekick.

Well we try my flat again but my neighbours still aren't in, obviously, so we sit on the doorstep. I ask her if she wants to study. So we study on the doorstep for a while.

""Wait when do you have to be home?"" I ask her.

""Uh, anytime."" She smiles back.

""Cos I have no idea how long it will be till my neighbours get back. You don't have to wait with me the whole time you know""

""No I like it this is fun""

Wow. What a great feeling. When a pretty girl genuinely wants your company.
______________________________________

We chat for a while and quiz each other on metabolic pathways and then decide to wander again.

I climb a tree and then we talk about our families. I feel like a kid hanging out with his middle school girlfriend after school.

Eventually we spot a McDonalds.

So we go in. I haven't had breakfast, or eaten in hours. Fuck if I'm losing gains.

""So you know I don't have my wallet right?""

So she gets us a chicken nugget sharebox and sprites and we blow the straw packets at each other. Then we have ice cream.

We wonder by the park for a bit and it's getting colder so we head to a sports department store and check out all the cool bikes and skiing and climbing gear and I tell her I'll take her bouldering some time and she's down.

We leave and I reveal I've stolen a tennis ball and she gets mad at me becuase stealing is bad and scolds me so I keep bouncing the ball at her until she backs off and laughs and we play catch and she cant throw for shit and its cute.

The whole time, everything felt right. Like we'd been friends for ages, and we were on an adventure together.

We hit up a supermarket because I'm getting hungry again and we buy ham and dark chocolate and tangerines, and a jar of pickles. I wanted to get salted pistachios and mentioned it but the pistachios were very expensive and she was paying so... This time though we had a security guard following us around. For good reason too, I was still traipsing around in my slippers, which were muddy and beginning to fall apart. Probably looked like we were on drugs.

She pays again and I mentally add the tab up in my head with the nuggets. As we leave the guard says to us ""scuse me did ya pay for those"" and I say ""why would we steal pickles mate"" and she waves the receipt at him and gives him that Stacey disgust sneer that we've all sadly been on the receiving end of. It was astounding watching the pretty girl face morph into ultimate bitch putdown mode. There are probably betas in her life who only ever know her as this.

But hey I get to experience the cute, dorky side of her, and I'm loving it.

______________

We leave the supermarket and she reveals that she actually stole the pistachios and hid them in her purse and I hug her cos I'm proud and squeeze her ass and then we eat our meal in the park.

After the meal we lay together on the grass for a while and I give the tennis ball to a dog that tried to steal our food and then we attempt the neighbours again but still nothing and its like 6pm and I'm starting to get a bit irked.

It's beginning to get cold now and I'm afraid the girl is getting bored of me and also that my neighbours might just have gone away for ever and I don't wanna have to call a locksmith but soon it will be late. I decide to take her to the one place in town I haven't taken her to yet.

Paki bro is cool again with us using the computers, and so we browse memes together for a while, and the hambeast is still there literally doing the same thing as before. She tells me about rick and morty but I don't really like rick and morty but I pretend its cool anyway cos why not and then I show her reddit and she doesn't really get it and then I tell her 9/11 was an inside job and we spend the next 2 hours arguing over conspiracy theories.

I make 4 journeys to check on the neighbours in the meantime and my slippers are broken and flapping at this point and its fucking almost 9pm and no one is home yet. I really don't want to have to do the lame and expensive option of getting a locksmith but its getting increasingly likely. What if my neighbours were just away? I hadn't heard them banging in a while tbh...

Everytime I get back to the cafe she is slouched there scrolling instagram and she hasn't left yet and its dark now and the cafe has got that dingy yellow light grimeyness to it and with the pretty bored girl sitting there and the ambience it looked like a damn Hopper painting and that snapshot remains imprinted in my mind. Really nice.

I tell her no one is stopping her from going home as it's getting late.

She says she feels bad for me and wants to see me get tucked in bed nice and warm.

Sweet

________________________

At 9 pm I break and realise my neighbours probably aren't coming back tonight and it was just my luck (or providence) that I got locked out today. I decide to go for the last resort and call up a locksmith using the girls phone. I'm bit grumpy about it but also got shit to do tomorrow.

>""I only have 1 door I'm locked out of how much and how long?""

The lady on the other side said £70. Reasonable. 40mins.... Sure.

But first I have to run it by the girl.

>""You're not broke are you?""

>""Why""

>""I need 70 for the locksmith""

>""Sure"" she says

>""Okay please come immediately"" I tell the lady.

We leave and I attempt to give the internet cafe guy £10 of her money as a gesture of thanks but he's not having it and seems more invested in the asian tv show he's watching anyway.

So we go to the ATM so she can withdraw the cash and then return to the doorstep to wait for the locksmith.

It seems locksmiths and drug dealers have a lot in common. They always seem to be '20 more minutes"".
__________________________

After 80 mins the girl starts yawning and I begin to shiver cos it's cold and she cuddles up to me. I call again and basically shout at the lady on the phone to hurry up and also to give me a discount. She says 10%. I say that's not enough and I wanted 20. She said 'ok ok'.

I can feel myself getting hot angry at the whole situation now but I catch myself cos I know its stupid and I don't wanna break frame in front of the girl.

So finally, after 90 mins the guy arrives and I think its gonna be a simple affair but nope, life ain't that easy.
___________________________
**Final Boss**

So this guy shows up and he's eyeing me up oddly and eyefucking the pretty girl. He asks what needs opening.

I show him the front door and the top latch lock that just needs to be picked or whatever, I actually have no idea how locksmiths operate but I'm sure he's had this a million times before.

He gives me a 'hmmm' and a 'haaa' and says ""well it looks like I'm gonna have to drill it""

That sounds expensive.

>  ""Drill it? Is there nothing else you can do?""
> 
>  ""No I'm gonna have to remove the lock and install a new one""
> 
>   ""Does that mean new keys and shit?""
> 
>   ""Yeah I'm afraid so""
> 
>   ""Hey man I don't wanna bother my neighbours just cos I'm an idiot, you sure there's no other way you can try?""
> 
>   ""No this happens all the time only way is to drill it out"" he seems pretty sure of himself.
> 
>   ""Nah dude I'm not gonna pay for that"".

It's got a bit tense because we both realise neither of us is willing to back down yet. The girl can feel the animosity between us but she seems to know her place and doesn't say anything.

The frame battle continues.

I weigh up my options. I need to get in. This guy wants to rob me. I could get a new locksmith, that means another 90 mins probably, and maybe another scumbag. Fuck that I want to get inside now.

Then I think back to one of the first lessons I learned when i stumbled across this subreddit.

**""Your greatest power as a man is your ability to walk away"".**

I smile.

> ""Okay dude cool I'm not gonna inconvenience my neighbours, will figure out how to get in tomorrow""

> I ask the girl ""hey, can we go back to your place tonight?

> She's surprised but says ""sure of course"".

> ""Cool that's sorted then, sorry dude I'm just a broke student you know haha""

I see the panic of a lost sale in his eyes, he realises that I'm not bluffing.

But I give him an opening. In truth, I actually want this damn door open. You must always give them an opening to backtrack, it helps them save face. 
> 
> ""Could you just give it one last look though just to make sure?""
> 
> ""You know what mate, let me try something"" he says, as he rummages in his van.

Of fucking course. You go for it *mate*. You try something *mate*.

Bastard.
_______________________________

So he grabs this long hook claw thingy and feeds it through the letter box and opens the door in 4 seconds flat and I wanna bash his fucking head in but mostly I'm just glad that we're finally inside and it's warm and also victory tastes sweet cos absolutely fuck this guy. Don't blame him that much tbh, most people are weak and agreeable and probably fall for this one all the fucking time, but that's still such an asshole way to do business. 

So she hands me the cash but I give her 20 back and she has a £5 note and so I give him the £55 (for 5 mins worth of work not bad bro) and he says

>""Its 70 mate""

I get a hot flash of anger. Wow. Round 2 it is.

>""Your boss gave me 20% off for being late""

>""I wasn't told anything about that"" he says.

>""Well she did""

He pauses for a moment. Still holding the money. I can feel the girl get more anxious. We're inside now and the silence makes the tension worse.

> I'm pissed. ""Whether she told you or not you still owe me a discount you were very late""

He smiles. It's a good shit eating smirk, ladies must like it.

>""Okay but its 56.""

This guy must be joking.

The hot anger cools into a shrewd sharp chill as I realise.

Fuck this guy. I know exactly what he's doing. If he's not gonna get his cash, he'll at least try and make me sperg out and break frame in front of the girl. Petty but effective, cant allow me to win too hard can he?

I give them both a smile. ""Do you have a pound babe?"" I ask her. She doesn't. So I go upstairs and grab a pound from my loose change. It feels great to be back in my home again. I also clean up a bit more and fabreeze. Lol.

Probably should not have left her downstairs alone with the asshole, but I get back down and he hasn't cucked me so I put the coin straight into his palm.

""Okay we're done you can go now""

He seems pleased with himself and leaves.

__________

We get upstairs and I put the radiators on, down a glass of water and stare at myself in the bathroom mirror for a while to try to dissipate the anger. Such a great day and one guy's gotta be an asshole and ruin it.

Then I realise that I don't have to think about it that way and actually I just smashed through a significant confrontation that I would have failed miserably years ago. This is the kind of shit Dads train you for and I never had a Dad but shit, I managed to do it. They say TRP is just for picking up women but honestly it's so much more; this place taught me how to hold frame and power-talk and navigate confrontations like this. Beforehand I would have been an agreeable pussy and bent over for the guy.

And the day had been fucking great too. A day disconnected from responsibilities and exams and social media. A day free of anxiety, where I could just flow in the moment and mess around with a cute girl like I did when I was a kid... And had I never even spoke to the girl, had I pussied out in that one pivotal moment in the library, this day would never have happened.

Always approach guys, you never know where the story with that girl will go, and pussying out kills the story before it even gets to start. Regret is always worse than rejection.

As I think about this I give myself shivers and am proud, and then smile in the mirror like a fucking psycho and scare myself.... but then realise its not that bad and I can smile when I'm proud if I want it's no big deal.

I enter the living room and she's taken off her coat and shoes and looks at me warmly and says ""you have a nice place"" and I say 'thanks' and then she immediately and very eagerly begins removing my clothes.
_______

**Epilogue**
_________

The next morning we cook breakfast and I'm head chef and she's like my nurse handing me scalpels and shit and its fun to boss her around and she follows my instructions. Afterwards I walk her to the high street to see her off. At the ATM I withdraw all the money from the tab I racked up yesterday and pay it all back immediately. Then I kiss her off at the station.

I feel pretty darn great about myself and basically skip home and jump into bed and just take some time to process things now that I'm finally alone.

The whole of yesterday was amazing, and I learnt so much about myself. All it took was some damn disconnection from life for a while.

I consider trashing my phone and getting a brick. Could I make the leap? Probably a good fucking idea. We know now that Zuck is listening to everything we say, and I'm trying to avoid getting on more lists than the many I'm already on.

Then I think about the girl, and just how lovely and sweet she was to be around. It was like she energised and supported me, gave me the life and exuberance I was missing. I suddenly really wanted to see her again, and felt the first few hints of one-itis settle in... She was so nice and feminine and smart and loyal and had the whole girl next door ""would never cheat on u"" vibe going. Hey, if we were a couple this would be a great origin story to tell people... I wonder what our kids would look like...

I settle for going on facebook to look at her pictures and miss how pretty she is.

I click on her profile pic which is very demure and innocent and makes her look smart and then I see it instantly.

>""In a relationship with""

Lol. Why did I get my hopes up. What was I expecting.

AWALT after all.

 Sylvia Plath, *The Bell Jar*

____
Around two years or so ago. I became attractive.

I’d swallowed the pill a while back, but like most of you, I assumed I was some kind of exception and didn’t lift. Well I kind of did, but had a pretty severe case of fuck-around-itis and no discipline; not to mention an inability to cook and feed myself properly. I made no gains. 

I was redpill aware, and gamed girls, but really didn’t make that much progress. I knew how to pass shit-tests but didn’t get any, I knew what to do with LMR but had no girls in my room. 9s and 10s were actually quite kind to me; I mistook this for attraction, not realising that I’d actually just fallen into the “asexual-child” category women put guys in who are not even considered men, let alone a prospect.  

Eventually the humility hit me, I couldn’t stay deluded forever, and I had to accept it when looking at myself in the mirror. I was ugly.

Now I had been given a few gifts that I was wasting; one was height, no one can call me “tall”, but I’m above the average at least, so, hypothetically, I was at the threshold most women needed to consider me. The other was a not-ugly face. I wasn’t beautiful, I didn’t have a thick jaw or strong cheekbones, but my face was passable; no stand out blemishes or disproportioned features.

I can work with this, I thought. I may not be Brad Pitt but I can scrape through into “attractive” if I work hard enough. 

There were however, downsides to the gifts, and things I didn’t get; my height came with a skinny, ectomorphic body, with an albatross armspan leading to thin wrists and pencil neck. My face can be considered feminine, boyish; more Justin Bieber than Ryan Gosling, weak chin, unable to grow a beard, or even sufficient stubble. My hair at the time was long, thick and gay. My back twisted into one of the worst cases of rounded shoulders I have seen on anyone, with a forward facing nerd neck, video-gamers anterior pelvic tilt, the whole shebang. It was gross. 

I was a 3, if I’m being nice. But at that level ratings mean nothing anyway; anything less than a 7 and you’re invisible to women. 

At the time I still had this magical idea of women, that they were different than us, that they could look past the beauty and be attracted to alpha-personality on the inside, that they didn’t need us to look good in order to want to fuck us, we could make up for it in other ways. That they had better control of their sexual urges and weren’t as visually turned on as us. That they didn’t really enjoy sex like we do and degeneracy put them off; that they were pure, poised beings with grace and innocence.

Lmao. Delusional. 

After years of painful rejections and bitchy put downs, I stopped making excuses and began to accept that I wasn’t the exception; I needed to lift and fix my body in order to become attractive; all the game in the world couldn’t help me if I still looked like a teenage fedora nerd.

So I began to take it seriously.
________________________
I started off as a 3. 

The first thing that happened was my posture sorted itself. Deadlifts and Bent-Over-Rows fixed my forward shoulders within a fortnight. Stretches solved the APT. I was purposefully checking my posture and neck whenever I remembered, and forcing myself upright. It was uncomfortable, sometimes painful, at first, but my body fell into a new equilibrium and settled. I stood up straighter and sat better in chairs; people would notice, a few said “did you get taller?”. I became a 4. 
________________

Next I cut my hair. It used to hang below my ears cos fuck gender norms and short haircuts were for jocks and I liked heavy metal. This time though I told a new barber to cut it short. Men have short hair.

It was a disaster. I was horrified at the boot-camp haircut he gave me, it made my face look even skinnier and gaunter than before.

But I pushed through it, after a few weeks the hair grew out and became scruffy and messy and actually… looked good. I suddenly felt 3 years older and more masculine, looked like an actual male. I began taking care of it better, stopped shampooing it every day like a retard, and after a few weeks of grease it settled into a natural, thick cleanliness. It felt so nice I would just play with it sometimes. 

People commented; “your hair looks so much better this way”. I became a 5.
_______

At this point I was lifting properly. I was going 4 times a week, no exceptions, no excuses, and enjoying it. I wasn’t lifting heavy, and was a bit insecure about my low weight on the bar, but knew ego-lifting was for pussies who hurt themselves. More importantly though, I was cooking properly, and eating properly. I enjoyed this new hobby, cooking, more than the lifting. I was hungry all the time, something I had never known or experienced, and so I grazed throughout the day until I was hitting 3k+ calories consistently. Everything about me got slightly chubbier, and I stopped being able to see my ribs; my face started packing on fat too, and began to take on a more masculine appearance, my skin looked and felt different. A few people said “you look healthier, you look like you’re glowing”. I became a 6. 

____________________

I changed my wardrobe. I’d just hit it big time on a STEM scholarship so splurged out on new clothes. At first I went on reddit fashion subreddits and brought desert boots and oxford shirts and chinos, but I looked like a damn Victorian twink wearing all this. I was very self-conscious going outside because it just didn’t feel right, it was like I was in a costume.

Sometimes I would go out in sweats and a hoodie and trainers and think “wow I actually look kind of badass” like, old women would walk across the street to avoid me. So I adopted the style. I dressed like a black dude for a while and felt much more comfortable; it felt like “me”, and it would hide my skinny frame. Eventually I started finding which colours worked for me, and adding my own personality to the style; things about me from teenagehood I couldn’t just drop, band t-shirts and chucks and vans and flannel. It worked, very well. I got compliments from people on the roadman-grunge hybrid, it felt effortless and suited me, didn’t feel like a costume. I’m young, and stopped trying to dress old. I became a 7.
____________________________
It was at this point I started getting looks from women on public transport. I would hop onto a train and a 5/10 would see me and I’d see her and then her eyes would snap away and I’d be like “weird” and then she’d look again and see me looking and her eyes would snap away again and then she’d fix her hair. Often I would check my face to see if I had anything in my nose or whatever.

This kept happening for a while and I was getting quite self-conscious about it. Was I creepy or weird? Was I dressed funny? Have I got a big nose or ears or something and they just can’t stop looking?

It’s been about a year at this point and I can finally squat my bodyweight for 5x5 and while I still look skinny in clothes I check myself out shirtless in the mirror and am impressed. I moved on from my strength program to an aesthetics program and started actively working on my pencil neck to make it thicker and chest to make it wider. I saw results within weeks. Suddenly my neck was solid and thick and I was stretching my shirts. I’d also picked up bouldering and this pumped up my forearms and back like no-ones business. I became an 8.
___________
It started to become undeniable that women were checking me out. Every time I would get on a train there would be at least one woman who would see me and we’d meet eyes and she’d quickly look away. Then her hand would go to her nose and scratch it or she’d smooth down her skirt or she’d fidget or fix her hair or fringe. I didn’t understand why. Often she’d look back at me when she thought I wasn’t looking again and I’d catch her and she’d snap away again and I started having a lot of fun messing with girls this way. 

I even began to count how much it happened during the day; my average is 6. Some days are better than others, normally after a haircut or during rush-hour. Honestly, if this is what it’s like being an attractive guy getting checked out by women, I cannot even begin to imagine what it’s like being an 18 year old HB9 in public; like a minor celebrity probably. No wonder they’re all so damn entitled and full of themselves, the validation is immense. Or maybe it just gets tiring and annoying after a while. I still enjoy it though. 

Some women would hover nearer to me or turn their body so they were facing me and their feet would point in my direction or they’d begin copying things I did or how I sat. Some just couldn’t stop looking, even if I caught them. There was this one girl, not that attractive, who backed up into me on a very crowded sardine train and started grinding her fucking ass into my crotch like we were in a club. I thought it was an accident at first but got a boner anyway but then she kept fucking doing it and I knew for a fact that she could feel my hardon poking her buttcrack yet she continued. 

It started to become flattering when I would get the looks from really hot women. Girls who I still considered out of my league would stare at me and sneak glances and I’d look back like “wtf you looking at” and then they’d sit next to me or across from me and play with their hair or part their legs or touch the inside of their thighs. Sometimes it would come from older women, cougars and milfs who were much more subtle about it but would also smile at me when I caught them looking. 

Oh yeah, the smiles from women were a big giveaway, women don’t randomly smile at ugly men. 

________________

I was still denying it though. Still sneakily checking my reflection in my phone to make sure I didn’t have anything on my face or a booger. I couldn’t accept I was attractive, not after a whole life of invisible betadom. I was actually getting laid at this point though, with 6s and 7s I met at school, and this would improve my mood and mindset. It began to show in the way I walked, my aura changed and I would manspread or check out girls without giving a fuck. At this point, I’m a 9 to some women. I can’t pull off the whole big and masculine thing, still too boyish, but I definitely got that pretty boy Dorian Gray fuckboy vibe going.

It was when I got these stares from women who were with their boyfriends that I began to get blackpilled. They would sit there holding their boyfriends hands or he’d be diddling away on his phone and the bitch would sneak glances and then get all fidgety. We’d meet eyes and I’d hatestare her and then she’d blush and then start grooming herself and the guy would be fucking oblivious. She would continue to sneak glances for a while until they left, or sometimes the guy would pick up on it and then hatestare me back and then put an arm around his girl or something. I don’t blame him. The whole time all I could think was “stop looking at me whore your bf is right there”.

It’s when I started getting stares from the teenage girls and children, some of them quite clearly pre-teens that it started to make me feel sick. I understand that I look like I could be in one-direction or something but I was not ready for this level of blackpilling. They can’t start this early can they? When I was that age all I cared about was yugioh. Wtf are they doing staring at me? This is wrong, very wrong. Often it would make me so uncomfortable I would get off and wait for the next train.

Every time I looked in the mirror I was unimpressed, still fuck ugly and twinky, still and forever small.

Yet the indicators from the outside world were undeniable. I would be walking past a group of girls who were talking loudly and they’d all go quiet and look. Women in my vicinity would get louder and more obnoxious, trying to draw my attention. And still, always, excessive spontaneous grooming from any girl who would see me. 

One girl in the library who I used to check out while she squatted at the gym would plop herself down next to me and sigh loudly. Then she’d keep doing it and then accidently bump into me sometimes or drop things and then sigh some more. Another girl followed me around a party and eagerly fetched me drinks and asked me very personal questions until her boyfriend had to confront me and I acted all oblivious. 

A lot of women conveniently forget to mention their boyfriends around me. I’d hang out with them for weeks or months and we’d chat in class and I’d flirt quite heavily but subtly as I’m good at it by now and she just won’t tell me she has a boyfriend until I either find out myself through social media or I see them together or she’s forced to mention it because we’re in a group setting or one of her friends sabotages her and brings it up. Normally there’s a quick “wtf bitch why u do that” look between the two girls after. Hilarious shit. 

_____

Then you get the betas who are scared of you and treat you like a king. The guys who stutter around you and worship the ground you walk on. You have the guys at the gym who end their sets early if you ask them for the rack because they’re so fucking agreeable they’re scared of telling you they have sets left. There was a dude who basically did my coursework for me for a while, whenever I’d ask him for help with a question he just sent me the full answer and it confused me at first why this guy was bending over backwards for me until I found out he was a faggot and that’s when I realised just how much worship women get from betas; pathetic.

Then you have the betas who are absolutely threatened by you and try to AMOG you at every turn. They get all hyper-competitive in groups, especially with girls, and are fucking loud and obnoxious. I just sit back and let them crash and burn, knowing the golden rule is the more you talk the more faggy you come across. I feel kinda bad for these guys because they’re not attractive and hate you because you are, but they don’t lift or make any real effort and think being aggressive makes them more alpha so not my problem. 

________
Ugly and average girls are super nice to me and give me the sparkle eyes like I’m a god and seem to be happy they’re just in my presence. They laugh at everything I say even when I’m not trying to be funny and stalk my facebook profile with their friends (attested by the random likes on photos posted 4 years ago). Pretty girls go into full on bitch mode as soon as we meet. This never happened before, I was treated like a child before, but still human. Now the 8s and up all assume I want to fuck them (or hope I do) so start shit-testing me from the first word. 

Then there’s the girls who change their whole personality around you and become fake. There’s this histrionic jewish girl in my class who bounces around me and does all she can to try and impress me and is wild and childish but in that attractive way where you know she’s crazy in the sack. It was cute at first so I asked her if she wanted to hang out after class with my friends to smoke weed and so we did and I brought my bro round who is one of my best friends but also kind of beta still and we all smoked and he didn’t really say anything embarrassing or cringey he’s just kind of shy and doesn’t lift and this whore went into full on beta shaming putdown mode on the dude and made fun of him and laughed. It made me SO angry that she could so easily flip between submissive sex kitten to ice queen sneering maneater, especially to my best friend, and so I caught that shit and stopped it as tactfully as I could in the situation then ghosted her. 
_____________________
At this point I’m actually getting laid a lot, from women who meet my standards, and it’s hard not to start hating women and just how fucking degenerate they can be. I started off being scared of women; thinking they were smart little princesses with sweet smiles, and they terrified me because they seemed to see right through me and had this magical, ethereal power of intuition. Now I know that was just me projecting my own weakness and insecurity and actually they’re all fucking stupid and malicious and irrational.

Before trp I didn’t hate women. They baffled me, they confused me, they scared me, but I didn’t hate them. I treated them with “respect”, which really meant I kissed ass and sucked up to them. I didn’t get laid.

Now I get laid, and I hate women. Now they piss me off. Now they frustrate me. Now they disappoint me. Now I’m a misogynist.
________
I’m not a woman hater due to inexperience like the feminists think so, in fact when I was inexperienced I treated women better than I ever do now. It’s precisely because I deal with the prettiest and smartest girls on the daily that I’ve come to the conclusion that they’re all fucking retarded. All of them. If they’re pretty they’re a whore. If they’re smart they’re also a whore. The “smartest” girls I know are the biggest sex addicts and wildest in bed. If they’re not a whore they’re normally ugly, or just fucking dopey, or incredibly bitchy and hard to be around. 

Oh and “boyfriend”. Lol. That word means nothing to pre-wall women. Or at least, it doesn’t mean what we think it means. It means companion. It means backup option. It means fashion accessory. It means status symbol. To be paraded around and make other girls jealous. But it definitely does not mean “exclusive sex partner”. The “boyfriend” is a term for the baseline, comfortable branch she’s sitting on at the moment while reaching for a higher-chad, at the slightest hint of confirmed upgrade the dude is dropped. Closest translation to trpSpeak is “main plate”. There is no such thing as a girl who is 100% exclusive to her man, they all cheat, and often without thinking about it, never ""on purpose"". They don’t see it as cheating, it's just normal to them, they feel entitled to it. Their definition of cheating changes with their whims and the weather. I’ve banged way too many girls with boyfriends to ever take the “I have a boyfriend” shit-test at face value. 

You’ll be surprised at the things girls tell you when you’ve just pounded her into an existential crisis and she realises you’ll never actually commit to her, you know she’s a whore and accept it without judgement. She’s honest in that moment. The n-counts they reveal… the experiences they’ve had, and the way they speak about their boyfriends, or orbiters… With utter contempt! With revulsion, mockery! I’ve had more than one girl lay there telling me about the size of another guys dick or how much of a pussy he is or laughing about when he cried or did something embarrassing and it made me fucking sick. 
________________
I’ll be laying in bed after having cum in some girls asshole and she’ll sigh as she picks up her phone and there are 20 ignored messages from her orbiters and I’ll sometimes look over and it will be something like “sorry for getting all emotional yesterday I was drunk lol, wanna get lunch today?” and she’d be like “not today sorry xxox” and if only the dude knew that she’s laying on my chest scratching my balls with her other hand while typing this. Sometimes I’m pounding a girl with a fistful of hair and her phone keeps buzzing and it’s her boyfriend and I say “aren’t you gonna get that” and she says “nah just ignore it” and I say “it’s distracting switch it off” so she switches off her phone.

And then you have the ones who are all sweet and innocent and demure and shy and have the perfectly cultivated family oriented social medias and aesthetic photography instagrams yet are in an uber to your place at the slightest hint of a booty call and eagerly tongue swirl your asshole while you browse reddit on your phone.
_________________________
The wool is no longer over my eyes. It has been burnt away violently. They’re all whores. All of them. women on the train who stare without shame. The MILFs who brush their tits up against you. The teenage girls who think they’re being sneaky taking snapchats of your manspread. The girls who kiss you while their boyfriend is in the other room at the party. The girls who sit in front of you during lectures and bend over and turn around a lot. The girls who take selfies for their boyfriends while their lower half is grinding on your dick.

All of them. Without exception. All it took for me was to get attractive and suddenly I’m in a completely new world, an entirely different fucked up game where the true nature of the female sex is revealed. Becoming Chad was the best and worst thing that ever happened to me. Sure I wasn’t getting laid before but at least I had faith in the “fairer” sex and my world was more pleasant. The illusion was nice to uphold for a while… but now that it’s shattered I’m left with a disgusting, stark, reality that I didn’t sign up for. I didn’t want this shit, send me back to the Matrix please.

___

You don’t get hit by the anger phase just once, it comes in waves. Initially when you swallow the pill, but multiple times after that. The first time you fuck a cute little thing and she treats you like a sex-god only to realise you’re actually her plate and she treats every other guy this way too. The first time you accidentally meet the kids of that woman who’s face you cum-splattered a few days before. The first time you get given an STD by that small innocent girl you met at the art gallery. Each time you’ll get the surge of rage. Why the fuck do they have to be like this? How can they ALL be like this, yet uphold the good-girl image so perfectly and sweetly? They’re all fucking whores. They’re all damn liars. 

The sex isn’t worth it. After overindulging as Chad for a while it becomes boring. Meaningless. I don’t want to use these girls as fucktoys, I hate it. And even if I stopped, some other guys will use them anyway. I just wish they’d all stop being lying fucktoys period. Can’t we just have enforced monogamy again where everyone fucks only one person their whole life and sex isn’t a big fucking deal at all? Where we understand the destructive nature of sex as a drug and keep it under control?

Yes I know it’s delusional and beta of me and imma get the spergs like “still bluepill, still anger phase why r u endosrsed u retard, just deal with it enjoy the decline blab la bla” but fuck man, if you’d seen what I’ve seen you wouldn’t just be able to cope with this shit and remain a bystander, it’s sad what’s happened to our women. They’re not the enemy, they’re not something to be used and enjoyed and thrown away, they’re our sisters and mothers and daughters…“enjoy the decline” is for hedonistic, nihilist losers, faggots who assume they have no power in the world so just fucking give up trying to change it.  

I became attractive to get girls, I became Chad, and the world I was inducted into horrifies me. I want out.

Women want to feel like they have to overcome obstacles to win a man’s heart. They crave the challenge of capturing the interest of a man who has other women competing for his attention, and eventually prevailing over his grudging reluctance to award his committed exclusivity. The man who gives his emotional world away too easily robs women of the satisfaction of earning his love. Though you may be in love with her, don’t say it before she has said it. Show compassionate restraint for her need to struggle toward yin fulfillment. Inspire her to take the leap for you, and she’ll return the favor a thousandfold.

**II. Make her jealous**

Flirt with other women in front of her. Do not dissuade other women from flirting with you. Women will never admit this but jealousy excites them. The thought of you turning on another woman will arouse her sexually. No girl wants a man that no other woman wants. The partner who harnesses the gale storm of jealousy controls the direction of the relationship.

**III. You shall make your mission, not your woman, your priority**

Forget all those romantic cliches of the leading man proclaiming his undying love for the woman who completes him. Despite whatever protestations to the contrary, women do not want to be “The One” or the center of a man’s existence. They in fact want to subordinate themselves to a worthy man’s life purpose, to help him achieve that purpose with their feminine support, and to follow the path he lays out. You must respect a woman’s integrity and not lie to her that she is “your everything”. She is not your everything, and if she is, she will soon not be anymore.

**IV. Don’t play by her rules**

If you allow a woman to make the rules she will resent you with a seething contempt even a rapist cannot inspire. The strongest woman and the most strident feminist wants to be led by, and to submit to, a more powerful man. Polarity is the core of a healthy loving relationship. She does not want the prerogative to walk all over you with her capricious demands and mercurial moods. Her emotions are a hurricane, her soul a saboteur. Think of yourself as a bulwark against her tempest. When she grasps for a pillar to steady herself against the whipping winds or yearns for an authority figure to foil her worst instincts, it is you who has to be there… strong, solid, unshakeable and immovable.

**V. Adhere to the golden ratio**

Give your woman 2/3 of everything she gives you. For every three calls or texts, give her two back. Three declarations of love earn two in return. Three gifts; two nights out. Give her two displays of affection and stop until she has answered with three more. When she speaks, you reply with fewer words. When she emotes, you emote less. The idea behind the golden ratio is twofold — it establishes your greater value by making her chase you, and it demonstrates that you have the self-restraint to avoid getting swept up in her personal dramas. Refraining from reciprocating everything she does for you in equal measure instills in her the proper attitude of belief in your higher status. In her deepest loins it is what she truly wants.

**VI. Keep her guessing**

True to their inscrutable natures, women ask questions they don’t really want direct answers to. Woe be the man who plays it straight — his fate is the suffering of the beta. Evade, tease, obfuscate. She thrives when she has to imagine what you’re thinking about her, and withers when she knows exactly how you feel. A woman may want financial and family security, but she does not want passion security. In the same manner, when she has displeased you, punish swiftly, but when she has done you right, reward slowly. Reward her good behavior intermittently and unpredictably and she will never tire of working hard to please you.

**VII. Always keep two in the kitty**

Never allow yourself to be a “kept man”. A man with options is a man without need. It builds confidence and encourages boldness with women if there is another woman, a safety net, to catch you in case you slip and risk a breakup, divorce, or a lost prospect, leading to loneliness and a grinding dry spell. A woman knows once she has slept with a man she has abdicated a measure of her power; when she has fallen in love with him she has surrendered nearly all of it. But love is ephemeral and with time she may rediscover her power and threaten to leave you. It is her final trump card. Withdrawing all her love and all her body in an instant will rend your soul if you are faced with contemplating the empty abyss alone. Knowing there is another you can turn to for affection will fortify your will and satisfy your manhood.

**VIII. Say you’re sorry only when absolutely necessary**

Do not say you’re sorry for every wrong thing you do. It is a posture of submission that no man should reflexively adopt, no matter how alpha he is. Apologizing increases the demand for more apologies. She will come to expect your contrition, like a cat expects its meal at a set time each day. And then your value will lower in her eyes. Instead, if you have done something wrong, you should acknowledge your guilt in a glancing way without resorting to the actual words “I’m sorry.” Pull the Bill Clinton maneuver and say “Mistakes were made” or tell her you “feel bad” about what you did. You are granted two freebie “I’m sorry”s for the life of your relationship; use them wisely.

**IX. Connect with her emotions**

Set yourself apart from other men and connect with a woman’s emotional landscape. Her mind is an alien world that requires deft navigation to reach your rendevous. Frolic in the surf of emotions rather than the arid desert of logic. Be playful. Employ all your senses. Describe in lush detail scenarios to set her heart afire. Give your feelings freedom to roam. ROAM. Yes, that is a good word. You’re not on a linear path with her. You are ROAMING all over, taking her on an adventure. In this world, there is no need to finish thoughts or draw conclusions. There is only need to EXPERIENCE. You’re grabbing her hand and running with her down an infinite, labyrinthine alleyway with no end, laughing and letting your fingers glide on the cobblestone walls along the way.

**X. Ignore her beauty**

The man who trains his mind to subdue the reward centers of his brain when reflecting upon a beautiful female face will magically transform his interactions with women. His apprehension and self-consciousness will melt away, paving the path for more honest and self-possessed interactions with the objects of his desire. This is one reason why the greatest lotharios drown in more love than they can handle — through positive experiences with so many beautiful women they lose their awe of beauty and, in turn, their powerlessness under its spell. It will help you acquire the right frame of mind to stop using the words hot, cute, gorgeous, or beautiful to describe girls who turn you on. Instead, say to yourself “she’s interesting” or “she might be worth getting to know”. Never compliment a girl on her looks, especially not a girl you aren’t fucking. Turn off that part of your brain that wants to put them on pedestals. Further advanced training to reach this state of unawed Zen transcendence is to sleep with many MANY attractive women (try to avoid sleeping with a lot of ugly women if you don’t want to regress). Soon, a Jedi lover you will be.

**XI.  Be irrationally self-confident**

No matter what your station in life, stride through the world without apology or excuse. It does not matter if objectively you are not the best man a woman can get; what matters is that you think and act like you are. Women have a dog’s instinct for uncovering weakness in men; don’t make it easy for them. Self-confidence, warranted or not, triggers submissive emotional responses in women. Irrational self-confidence will get you more pussy than rational defeatism.

**XII.  Maximize your strengths, minimize your weaknesses**

In the betterment of ourselves as men we attract women into our orbit. To accomplish this gravitational pull as painlessly and efficiently as possible, you must identify your natural talents and shortcomings and parcel your efforts accordingly. If you are a gifted jokester, don’t waste time and energy trying to raise your status in philosophical debate. If you write well but dance poorly, don’t kill yourself trying to expand your manly influence on the dancefloor. Your goal should be to attract women effortlessly, so play to your strengths no matter what they are; there is a groupie for every male endeavor. Except World of Warcraft.

**XIII. Err on the side of too much boldness, rather than too little**

Touching a woman inappropriately on the first date will get you further with her than not touching her at all. Don’t let a woman’s faux indignation at your boldness sway you; they secretly love it when a man aggressively pursues what he wants and makes his sexual intentions known. You don’t have to be an asshole, but if you have no choice, being an inconsiderate asshole beats being a polite beta, every time.

**XIV. Fuck her good**

Fuck her like it’s your last fuck. And hers. Fuck her so good, so hard, so wantonly, so profligately that she is left a quivering, sparking mass of shaking flesh and sex fluids. Drain her of everything, then drain her some more. Kiss her all over, make love to her all night, and hold her close in the morning. Own her body, own her gratitude, own her love. If you don’t know how, learn to give her squirting orgasms.

**XV. Maintain your state control**

You are an oak tree. You will not be manipulated by crying, yelling, lying, head games, sexual withdrawal, jealousy ploys, pity plays, shit tests, hot/cold/hot/cold, disappearing acts, or guilt trips. She will rain and thunder all around you and you will shelter her until her storm passes. She will not drag you into her chaos or uproot you. When you have mastery over yourself, you will have mastery over her.

**XVI.  Never be afraid to lose her**

You must not fear. Fear is the love-killer. Fear is the ego-triumph that brings abject loneliness. You will face your fear. You will permit it to pass over and through you. And when your ego-fear is gone you will turn and face your lover, and only your heart will remain. You will walk away from her when she has violated your integrity, and you will let her walk when her heart is closed to you. She who can destroy you, controls you. Don’t give her that power over yourself. Love yourself before you love her.

The closer you follow the letter of these commandments, the easier you will find and keep real, true unconditional love and happiness in your life.

# 

Such a thoroughly-weaponized and yet nonsensical term.

What men actually *hate* women? Seriously, where the fuck are these dudes?  Sure some men might be frustrated, and yes, even *angry* at women.  But hate? Seething, desire-to-destroy-and-humiliate **hatred?** It's laughable bullshit.

As men, we literally depend upon women biologically for the continuation of the species; hatred of them would be antithetical to our existence. The capacity to express any malice or violence toward women has been so thoroughly bred out of men over the ages **that we instinctively gang up and beat the shit out of a man who hits a woman, even if we've never met her before.** The men who are here on TRP aren't looking for an outlet for hatred or malice; men don't seek emotional outlets. They seek solutions. They seek a fix for unrequited desire. A need for acceptance, and yes, validation from women. It's very possible to be frustrated and even resentful of women because of that unfulfilled desire.  But hateful?  No.

**One cannot truly hate something while desiring it simultaneously.**

Like many terms that are feminist in origin, ""misogyny"" is emotionally-charged, broadly- and ambiguously-defined, and conveniently unfalsifiable.  It's the perfect recipe for **power talk.**  The reality is that what is ""sexist"" or ""misogynist"" varies enormously not only depending on what was said, but what man said it, what women heard it, and how those women perceive that man.  An actual, objective standard for what the term means **does not exist**.

In practice, the only definition for misogyny that women can universally agree on is ""things men do that I don't like"".  Maybe some component of a woman labeling a man a ""misogynist"" is actually rooted in her belief that he hates women, but the true message is in the **subtext** of the statement.  When a woman calls a man a ""misogynist"", what she's really communicating is that that man is not attractive or worthy enough to poke fun at women or ""get away"" with being offensive.  It has very little to do with addressing what is hateful and unjust; it's just women's way of sounding alarm bells at the sight of a man they perceive as bitter, or frustrated, or even angry with women, and thus demonstrably undesirable.  This term is used to make that assertion clearly, but without any **accountability** attached to it (which, of course, is a big no-no for most women).

""Misogyny"" isn't women *actually* being worried that a bunch of men secretly hate them and are out to get them.  It's just hypergamy in action.  It's women sussing out which men are worth fucking and which aren't, and then stating it out loud, but without any overt attachment to the statement.  It's rarely ever an indictment of a behavior itself, but of the man doing the behavior; a feeble and bratty attempt at a character assassination.  Treat it like any other petty insult from someone who's butthurt and emotional, and refuse to take it seriously.  Accuse her of being a Martian invader in a human skin suit, or one of those kleptomaniacs who steals the tops off of spray bottles.

The real tragedy here is that all of this crying-wolf over gendered ""offenses"" misses the forest for the trees, and with real and dire social consequences.  For women, real misogyny, true hatred of that which is feminine, **comes from within.**

The only misogyny that anyone should ever be worried about arrives secondhand, from the collective voice of the chubby, blue-haired masses, bankrolled and publicized by the Great American Church of Consumerism, whose response to rejection from the men they desire is never to look inward and improve, but to bleat long and loud, ""Men are evil. Reject everything they have built for you, for it will only keep you down. Pretend you have a penis, and this will solve all of your problems.""

This voice is the true enemy of women; the true source of the conspiratorial **hatred** which they so fear.  The one that, in the midst of the ever-growing gender-equalist narrative put forth by popular culture and media, the majority of women simply accept and let influence their life choices, because on a superficial level **it seems like it feels right.**  The one that compels them, one Huffpost article, one snide, passive-aggressive comment, and one affirmative action STEM hiring quota at a time, that happiness and fulfillment are to be found in mindlessly struggling against their biological programming, and against a life that would otherwise grant them meaning and contentment.",934,4,0.476500004529953,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first",1

This weekend, [The New York Times broke the story](http://archive.is/tB82x) that in 2013, Argento gave alcohol to a 17 year old actor and had sex with him.  The age of consent in California is 18.

The actor originally asked for $3.5 million, based on his income before the incident and its effect on his career.   According to documents sent to the Times via encrypted email, Ms. Argento, who is divorced and has two children, was both a mentor and a mother figure to Mr. Bennett, and the two were intermittently in contact as he grew up. “Jimmy’s impression of this situation was that a mother-son relationship had blossomed from their experience on set together”

This development mirrors my own experience with the court system in California.  While women enjoy many advantages in society, including often getting a pass for behaviors that would land a man a nearly guaranteed prison sentence; if you do your due diligence and follow procedures to the letter, the justice system works well for men against women who have wronged them, too.

It serves as a good reminder of a few things;

-if you dont use a throwaway, i would consider it. These lunatics are the kind of people who will doxx you.

-don't talk about TRP outside of TRP. Regular people are not going to respond well to words such as ""hypergamy"" and ""alphas"". Nobody these days has any critical thinking skills. Everyone is emotionally incontinent and is likely to just call you a misogynist rather than listen to what you have to say.

-almost every other sub will give you flak for even mentioning TRP.

-if you want to talk about TRP concepts to a buddy then make sure he can be trusted. Don't talk about TRP to blue pilled betas.

-if you are still on the side bar material, DO NOT mention that you go on TRP to anyone, nor go spouting off about how you understand women.

-censorship becomes more and more likely each day. Speak the truth and stand up for it.

Women are so turned around that they think the path to happiness is by acting like a man.

**The Modern Woman:** *I will become highly educated. I will build a successful career and make lots of money. I will have sex with as many partners as I can*

Women who enter their masculine frame and start acting like men end up miserable and lonely. We all know it, and we clearly see it playing out in society.

But there is a much more nefarious and less-frequently discussed phenomenon that I find much more disturbing.

Vagina envy.

Men are cutting off their own balls, their own masculinity, and acting like they wish they had a vagina.

**The Modern Man:** *I can't wait to find a chick to settle down with. I will sit around doing nothing meaningful with myself, praying for Mrs. Right to save me from my boring life. I want to cuddle on the couch with her and whisper sweet nothings. My greatest ambition in life is to find the Right One.*

-

**Introduction**

-

The following report is (edit: the first) one of a few hangouts I've done with the same woman. We do 'date-like' things. Some of this will be in a small portion of a book I've been working on outlining the path from lone wolf cold approach to proximity and social circle game. The journey we've been on will illustrate several concepts I attempt to convey about attractive women and social circle game. This one encounter opened me up to a new world which I'll describe in later reports with her. 

-

Now let's begin...

-

----------------------------------
------------------------------------

**Body**

-

I was going through security at a courthouse when a hot foreign girl came in line behind me. Nice tits. She was accompanied by an older schlub. I could hear her speaking one of the two other languages I can speak, 'Language Y' (enough competence to flirt with women). I attempt at some small talk. 

-

**Me**: *""Why are you here? You a criminal?""*, smirk on my face

-

**Her**: *""No! Just paying for a speeding ticket.""*

-

I forgot what else I said, but further interaction required disruption of the security process, look desperate, and looks bad socially. I didn't detect enough interest to go further. Moved on.

-

I check for my name on the screens, go up stairs, and enter the courtroom. I choose to sit at the very back on the bench. There were a few others already waiting. Nothing happened for a few minutes. 

-

Suddenly, I spot a girl to my left entering the room, she appears to be of a race that speaks one of the other languages I speak. Let's call her 'Rachel'.  She's cute, has nice tits, and is wearing tights that show off some booty. Yum. She sits down two benches in front of me to the left, a few people-widths inside. There are two men behind her. I don't remember the exact conditions, but I do remember wondering if some of the people around her were family/friends. This made me pause for a bit to strategize my approach. Approach anxiety was kind of there, but that's never my problem. My issue is being able to navigate this context properly so that negative social mechanisms don't kick in and shutdown my operation. **A girl can be totally into you, but then she senses her image is at stake then withdraws completely and you look stupid. Has happened before**. 

-

Eventually I determine that there are no social roadblocks in my way. She is vulnerable for approach now. It won't get anymore convenient than this moment. No one's sitting to her left blocking the entrance to the bench, and no one to the right for more than 15 ft. The opportunity lingers. All I have to do is walk over there. My window is closing. Just one person can screw it all up. Rationalizations about why I shouldn't try are going through my head. But if I don't attempt now, I'll forever hate myself. Rejection is better than regret. I make my move.

-

As I enter the bench, I use the language (language X). 

-

**Me**: *""Excuse me. Is anybody sitting there?""* (Me pointing to her right)

-

**Rachel**: *""Oh. Uhmm, no.""*

-

I squeeze in front of her and sit two people spaces to the right of her so as to not come across too strong. Chill for a moment. Don't look at her.

-

**Me**: *""What are you doing here?""* (Language X)

-

**Rachel**: (Doesn't seem to understand)

-

**Me**: (Repeat myself with better annunciation)

-

Turns out she's here because of some altercation with a friend. 

-

(Here on out, our conversation is a mix of Language X and English because she can't speak a lot of English)

-

She inquires about my appearance here. I tell her I'm seeing if I'm going to jail. This creates bait for her to ask more questions about me, creating more investment. Also, I keep some mystery while mixing in some badboy. Oh did I tell you I have a 'badboy' look? 

-

**Rachel**: ""What did you do?""

-

**Me**: (I tell her)

-

She goes more into depth about her situation and can't understand her summons sheet (written in English). An IOI most certainly. I take this opportunity as an excuse to scoot closer to her. She's wondering if she's at risk of going to jail. The paperwork doesn't say so, she's just summoned to act as a witness to the crime she charged her friend for.

- 

She asks if I've ever been arrested other times. I don't hold back on my history and my shenanigans. If there's one thing I've learned, crime, even violent crime is a panty-wetter. I once jokingly said I just got back from court deciding my fate on a liquor store robbery me and my friends were accused of. ""Not guilty"". She ate that shit up. Attraction over 9000. Just went along with it to see where it goes. I buttered her up and screwed up later, but that's not relevant. 

-

**Rachel**: *""You're soooo bad""* teehee hehe.

-

We chill for a moment. But I can see her fidgeting. She looks nervous. I ask her what's wrong. She says she's nervous with a shy smile. She changed her mind, she doesn't want to charge her friend anymore. She doesn't want her to go to jail. I lean over, put my hand on her shoulder and tell her it will be alright. I was the one who might get sentenced, but wasn't nervous, and most certainly wasn't going to show it. I'm the rock now. 

-

She starts touching me while talking some more. Indirect permission to escalate granted. I put my arm around her on the seat, caressing her shoulder slightly. She looks completely comfortable with it, doesn't acknowledge it. Turns out her friend and her friends mother were sitting in the same row as us on the other side to the right, giving us dirty looks. All I said was fuck her, if a 'friend' did that to me, they can go fuck themselves. Left it at that. I've learned to not delve into the affairs of a woman's life, just let her vent and just listen.

-

Other cases are going on. A bunch of idiots trying to bullshit their way out of their D.U.Is and drug charges. I wasn't buying it. The judge most certainly wasn't. Even a security guard laughed at some of them. I translate some of that to her and make fun of them. She tells me I'm so mean. Eventually I ask if she has a pen. She doesn't and asks why.

-

**Me**: *""You're going to write your number on my paper (summons sheet)""* (No phones allowed in court)

- 

**Rachel**: *""Oh really?""*

-

**Me**: *""Yes""*

-

I ask the woman two seats over if she has a pen I can borrow. She does and I give it to Rachel. *Number acquired*. Then I remember a lesson I learned at a bar once, always ask about her logistics in the middle of your session, not towards the end when she gets drunk and things become out of your control and can't close. So I ask her how she got here. She says she took the bus. 

-

**Me**: *""Maybe I can drop you off. Where do you live?""*

-

**Rachel**: (she can't pronounce her English street name)

-

I realized her summons sheet has her address. Perfect.

-

**Me**: *""I live only 5 mins away from here, you're only around 20mins away. It's not a big deal; I can drop you off""*

-

**Rachel**: *""Yeah, sure""*

-

*Now, we're getting somewhere*.

-

Her time is coming near based on the amount of people left. She's still nervous, I still caress her. She asks me if I can come up to the podium with her for support (how cute and feminine. Now I really want to violate her). I tell her I can't, but that she'll do fine. 

-

Her time comes up. She walks to the stand. She keeps looking back at me while speaking.

**Judge**: *""Why do you keep looking back there""*

-

**Rachel**: (No answer, keeps talking)

-

**Me**: (She's looking back at Papa Warlock, that's what she's doing)


-

There's a camera here monitoring all of us, monitoring me running some smooth game. Oh yeah.

-

Case Verdict: Friend gets a $1000+ fine and a record, no jail time.

-

Rachel sits back with me with my arm around her instead of the chair (slight escalation). The mother comes to our side and speaks in front of us to Rachel in Language X. I only caught bits and pieces, but I can tell it was shaming. Turns out it was...

-

**Mother**: ~*""How could you do that to a friend?""* Blah blah blah excuses.

-

I laughed and told her fuck them. Don't worry about it. 

-

My Case: Reduced fine on the condition I don't get another conviction, no jail time because I got lucky for reasons not relevant.

-

We exit the room and start walking towards the parking garage. I make sure nothing can fuck this up. I've gotten too far to fail. We get there. She offers to pay and even gives me her debit card pin. I spray the car with febreeze and a hint of cologne before she got in. She liked it, didn't care about the mess. She stays in the car. I tell her I'm taking the keys just in case she's a car thief. Parking paid. Drive off to her house playing Language X music. I take videos of us driving singing and laughing for my IG story. Letting the other girls know Dr. Warlock still got it. She admits to having a baby. I just say 'oh'. Cute, older than 24. Someone already impregnated her? *Shocker*.

-

We arrive near her apartment and start walking. As an excuse to go inside, I say I'd like to see the baby. She says it's at her aunt's house nearby.

-

**Me**: *""Oh I thought it was at your house. Let's walk to yours first, maybe we'll do that later""*

-

We arrive at the building entrance.

-

**Me**: *""Can I use your bathroom?""*

-

**Rachel**: *""Sure, that's fine""*

-

We go inside. There's a rocking baby chair near the door. Turns out I do have some urine to drain. 

-

She walks towards her room and starts fumbling around, I take a peek.

-

**Rachel**: *""No no no. You can't look. It's messy!* hehe. 

-

She grabs my arm and asks if I want something to drink.  I say yes.

-

We go in and she starts cooking something while listening to some music on her phone. She begins swaying her hips and getting into the music. Signal received, sweety. I begin some slight dancing, slowly getting closer to her. I grab her hand and slowly pull her to me grabbing her hips. I can feel those big tits on me. She turns herself around and starts grinding on me. I put my face in the crook of her neck and kiss her cheek. She puts my hands on her tits and starts kissing me. Insert make-out sesh and me grabbing some ass. No resistance at all. I pick her up and place her on the kitchen counter, telling her we should do it right here in the kitchen.

-

**Rachel**: *""You're so baaaad. Teehee. Not here, people can see!""*

-

We break away and smile at each other. I get into a more casual mood and say hey, let's check out your room.

-

**Her**: *""Why? What are we going to do there?""*

-

I ignore her and start walking out the kitchen. She follows me. I go in and it's small and indeed messy. There's a baby crib at the foot of her bed. I don't give a shit. Not my kid , not my problem, not my house, I'm getting some booty. 

-

She walks in all embarrassed. I tell her I don't care, then pick her up and throw her onto the bed, me on top of her. 

-

**Rachel**: *""Omg, I just met you and we're already doing this!""*

-

**Me**: *""Shhhhh""*, and start kissing her. She's very enthusiastic. 

-

I start rubbing her vagina above the pants, no resistance and I can feel she's wet. So I go in under the pants, no resistance and start fingering her. At one point, she, on her own volition, starts removing her yoga pants. I can smell her pussy, that smell when it's really wet and ready to go. We get to business. I felt like a Chad, rubbing it in all the faces on the blue pill sub and every guy that says my tactics are wrong and doesn't work. Just met this girl 1.5 hours ago in court, looking like trouble, and already fucking. She turned for doggy, I go to town. There's a big mirror in front of the bed. I stare at myself thrusting. I think of the [American Psycho scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXNCcWPUkBA). Oh, yeah. 

-

I tell her to suck my dick. She happily obliges. She was sucking like a porn star, purposely gagging on it. 

-

She said, *""Tell me how to please you. I want to see you cum""*. Man, I'm liking this girl already.

-

Anyways... business done and we're just lying down. She's tired. Apparently, she texted one of her friends that she met some guy at court and sent a pic. Now her friend is like ""omg I can't believe you let a strange guy into your house. You're so bad"". At this point I was on full alert. In an attempt to prevent any ASD bullshit, I told her to tell her I only came into the use the bathroom and left in a light-hearted way. She agreed. Whew. 

-

Edit: She told me this was crazy. We're in a court room. Its not appropriate to try. She thought I was cute but didn't think I would walk over and talk to her. She liked the fact that I didn't care. All in cute broken English. 

-

She wants to get dressed and go back into the kitchen. 

-

**Me:** *""No clothes allowed. I wanna see your body some more""*

-

**Rachel**: *""So you're my boss?* , teehee (English)

-

**Me**: *""Yes, I'm your boss""* (Language X)

-

Before she gets off the bed, I spank her ass.

-

She tidies up in the bathroom naked, but her kitchen windows have no covers so she puts some clothes on. I don't bother. We walk to the kitchen and I'm naked.

-

**Rachel**: *""Omg my neighbors and probably see you""*

-

**Me**: *""I don't care, let them watch""*

-

I have a good physique. No shame whatsoever.

-

We chat for a bit. I get dressed. Tell her I'll text her later. Leave.

-

Parts 2+ coming soon to forum near you. 

#The End.

**Lessons Learned**

 * Learn a another language of a people whose women you find attractive. Foreign women > [American Woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UzWHE32IxUc), even of the same color. School only gives you basics, is slow, and not much else. For proficiency, have a translator app on your phone, and you need to work around people that speak it or go to school/work abroad. Don't lie to yourself, you learned it to get pussy. 

 * My 'What are you doing here? Are you a criminal?' line was an intentional opener. It's accusatory in a fun way and gets her justify herself immediately. Has worked many times while a strange girl walked by me on the street, just not this time. 

 * Be aware of context. You liking her and her interested in you is not enough. Always be aware of the social situation. A girl can be totally into you, but then she senses her image is at stake then withdraws completely or even throws you under the bus. 

 * The best opportunities often occur when you're not looking for them. They happen so fast and often not at the best convenience. Act fast or the window will close. Rejection is better than regret. 

 * Criminal activity is never a negative for getting pussy. Neutral and often positive. Get arrested in front of a girl, committing crimes with her/in front of her, whatever, she likes it but often doesn't know it yet. Criminals often get the easiest and best pussy. That includes the 'sweet innocent' ones. Yo momma, yo daughter, yo sister, and yo wife. Not advocating crime, just telling you how it is.

 * You HAVE to be able to recognize indirect signs of interest and receptiveness to escalation. They are almost always INDIRECT. This girl asked me to help her read her summons sheet, that requires you to scoot closer. Don't mention it, just act. 'Just get it'. 

 * When she's nervous and uneasy or scared, you have to keep your cool. *""To be like a rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it""* – Marcus Aurelius. Let her flail around like a flag on a pole during a windy day, then return to rest. She'll thank you for it, I promise. Often in the form of pussy. You can hold her, shutup and just listen. Let her go through the emotional tide. That's all you need. That's what they consider, 'taking care of them'. 

 * When relocating for the bang, make sure you have everything in order. Check your pockets. Don't let others distract you or her from your rendezvous. Don't rush.

 * Don't delve into the affairs of a woman's life in search for a solution, just let her vent and listen. She's talking to you to vent, [she don't wanna be saved](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJn87TkZF38). Bite your tongue if you have to. 

 * Women and clueless men think this mating ritual process 'just happens'. My ass. It's methodical. You have to think two steps ahead and make the next move. She won't do it for you. Get creative if you have to and be persistent. 

 * Always ask about her logistics in the middle of your session, not towards the end when she gets drunk and things become out of your control and can't close. Driving a girl home is a perfect excuse to go into her place. 

 * If she's hot, is over ~23-25, she has a kid, guarantee. Guys have been busting nuts inside her since she was in 9th grade, maybe earlier, like nature intended. One of those sperm was bound to find its place. Expect it. 

 * Remember her dancing in the kitchen? This a female tactic. They put themselves in a position to receive male escalation attempts and see what happens. They don't think further than that much of the time. It's your job to identify this and make a move.",875,0,0.367900013923645,"girl, feel, really, find, still, shit, male, always, leave, relationship",1

And yet your prescription is to change and modify this undocumented problem, a very thinly veiled setup for failure. You know full well we cannot address concerns that have not been raised - Which makes this a kangaroo court by definition.

Your appeals process does not offer an opportunity to claim innocence, instead placing guilt into the default terms of appeal. 

But we reject your charges.

Our moderation team has gone to great length to ensure our members follow reddit’s terms of service. We see no terms in the [content policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/) that we have violated. And yet you allege we have broken this unwritten policy. How is it that you expect moderators and community to follow such rules is beyond me. Perhaps it is because you prefer to keep all communities in the dark about the unwritten rules. Keep everybody guilty of some crime, and selectively enforce it upon those you disagree with.

> “Show me the man, I’ll show you the crime.” — Lavrenti Beria, secret police chief under Stalin

To me, this seems like an immeasurably bad way to run a social media site which depends on its users for long-term survival. Perhaps it’s not in your interest to ensure Reddit stays around. Maybe you’re using censorship and quarantines as a means to redirect discussion into the direction you prefer. Maybe you’re trying to sway an election? I don’t know, that’s above my pay grade.


Misogyny is a very nebulous term, one that I disagree with heartily. Many use it in places where somebody has been critical of women, but does that meet the criteria of hate? I think that’s a very high bar to meet. One way we can test your definition of misogyny is simply to see how you’ve applied these standards site-wide.


Let’s say I started a subreddit with a mission statement:


>R/UpsetFemales is a subreddit for mocking reddit's large, vocal, and hypocritical female population.

>Women have a right to dignity and to exist, but they don't have a right to be upset and uncomfortable whenever they're confronted with sexism issues.

Would this meet your definition of misogyny? 


Well, substitute the words “female” and “women” with white people and you’ve got yourself the sub /r/fragilewhiteredditor. And for some reason they’re not quarantined.


Now I’m sure you guys understand the implications of picking and choosing what completely legal ideas and topics are okay to discuss on reddit. When you choose to block off /r/theredpill and post an endorsement to your point of view (Michel Kimmel), you’re tacitly endorsing the points of view you’ve chosen not to censor – especially the ones that align with Michael Kimmel.


Hatred (by your definition) is okay as long as the target is against white people.


What about towards men? Here are some lovely sentiments floating around reddit that the reddit admin tacitly endorses by not censoring or quarantining:

 [“Sorry you're going through this. It's the patriarchy: men think they own women. That is a flat out fact.”]( http://archive.is/XHCdk)

 [“sorry boys but its true and yall need to be taught not to rape. You are a cancer on society.”]( http://archive.is/GpzTw)

 [“I still see so many people say that ""All men are rapists"" This is a factually accurate statement expressing that men are socialized as both heterosexual and weapons against women and so typically have sex relationships that are not consensual in a fully self-actualized sense.”]( http://archive.is/e78kL)

[“I’m a misandrist, but I don’t want to be”](http://archive.is/N2lXY)

So it is clear, you tacitly endorse these positions if they are not quarantined as well.


To make matters worse, when you quarantined us, you put up a message directing our users to  Stony Brook University Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities whose executive director is Michael Kimmel.  The same Michael Kimmel who [denies male abuse victims](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9jypns/300000_subscribers_the_reddit_administration/). I see since then you’ve had the presence of mind to remove it- but without so much as an apology to our community of men who had to witness this. I would absolutely hate to know that the well being of abuse victims on /r/theredpill have been affected, or worse- hurt, by this event.


What would happen if the admin posted a message at the top of TWOX claiming that women’s abuse isn’t nearly as high as reported and that men’s abuse was much worse? Well, I’m pretty sure you’d call that misogyny.


So what’s it called when you do it to men? (It’s called misandry.)





We know the quarantine process isn’t simply about keeping the front page clear of controversial topics. There’s literal [shit porn]( https://old.reddit.com/r/scatporn), [women getting pissed on](https://old.reddit.com/r/watersports/), and [detailed rape fantasies](https://old.reddit.com/r/rapefantasies/) which have gotten the pass from your administration. Looks like you guys just love shit, piss, and rape. 

Meanwhile the content on TRP has helped thousands (if not more) of men find an identity and the strength needed to get back on the horse after terrible events like breakups, divorces, or false rape accusations. For some, they believe TRP literally [saved](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1prsqs/trp_knowledge_saved_my_life/) [their](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2dhqoh/trp_saved_my_life/) [lives]( https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/5daq79/red_pill_saved_my_life/). Some of whom could easily have ended up [dead](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/4il5of/close_friend_committed_suicide_after_falling/).

Look, you could have asked us to remove ourselves from /r/all, and we would have complied. But the quarantine makes things much worse. Mobile users see a message that we’ve gone private, causing our modmail to get literally hundreds of messages asking for access, completely halting actual mod functions. Members who have already subscribed are having a hard time finding us. It is clear that your goal with quarantine was to put as much into place as possible to make us fail, all while not actually pulling the trigger on an outright ban, because you know full well we keep the user base in check and do not allow rule breaking.


But I’m willing to give you guys the benefit of the doubt. Let’s say all of my well documented and evidenced accusations are simply wrong. Let’s say you really are just trying to make reddit a nice beige happy-land for new users and advertisers, and your goal was not to tacitly endorse all the hatred on the internet that you have chosen not to censor. I am willing to propose a compromise.


Remove the quarantine, and we will select the option to prevent being seen from /r/all. This has a lot of benefits. First of all, you won’t be tacitly endorsing every bit of hate on reddit because you’re no longer picking sides. But most importantly, your users will see the admin team actually applies rules in a balanced and fair manner, gaining you a level of respect that, let’s face it, Ellen Pao did a good job eroding.


We would be happy to comply with reasonable requests that help you with your advertisers and future IPO. We aren’t your enemy. The way you’ve gone about this was a big mistake and I think we can both agree on that. Let’s work together to move past this event and get the admin and users back on the same side for the benefit of reddit.

For those of you who don't know what ego lifting is,

>Ego lifting is someone who sadly gives a fuck about what others think of them at the gym, and loads more weight on the bar than they are capable of handling just so they can be seen by others ""lifting"" as much weight as they can get away with. 

Notice ""lifting"" in quotation marks. Yeah you might be able to do the minimum it takes to ""lift"" said weight, but at what cost? Your form sucks, you didn't do enough reps, you didn't do the right lift, and so on.

I see ego lifters every day at the gym. Doing way more weight than they can handle. Doing curls where they throw their shoulders backward so hard and have their elbows out in front of their body so far that they are getting zero bicep activation at all and turning it into a front deltoid workout. 

Or squatting 1/4 of the way down. Or dead lifting with a rounded back that looks like a question mark. Or using all the momentum they possibly can to bring the bar down on lat pulldowns. Turning incline bench/incline DB bench into a flat bench by moving their ass forward and arching their back. Turning overhead presses into a push press.  You get the idea.

A good prescription for being an insecure ego lifting faggot is to try out the Vince Gironda 8x8 system. 

#8 sets of 8 reps.... with 15 seconds of rest

Vince Gironda was an old school body builder who called this system ""the honest workout"" Your ego will quickly be crushed with this workout program. Because in order to do 8 sets of 8 with only 15 seconds or rest, you can't be doing a lot of weight.

Run it for 6 weeks. If you want to ease into it, take the first week and do 30 seconds of rest instead of 15 to get the tempo down, and calibrate the weight you can handle. Then in week 2, go down to 20 seconds. Weeks 3-6, 15 seconds. I guarantee you the initial weights you choose will be too heavy. That's how it was for me. You think you are picking a light weight, and then you realize you can't finish the 8 sets of 8 and have to go lower next time. 

It's not just 8 sets of 8, its 8 sets of 8 with good form. If you have to compromise your form at any point except maybe the last rep or two on the last set, its too heavy. 

Barbell curling 20 pounds? Dumbell curling 10 pounds? Squatting 135? Overhead Pressing only the bar? Neck Pressing only 115 pounds? Having to use the assist pad on pull ups/chin ups? If the thought of doing any of that makes you shudder because *gasp* people might think you are weak, the 8x8 system will put that mindset to rest. I can do 20+ chin ups easily in a single set. But in an 8x8 I have to do them assisted. Oh no, people are seeing me do assisted chin ups, oh no! How will I survive?

Here are the lifts I do when I run this program:

Monday: Gironda Neck Press, Wide Grip Dips, Overhead Press, Lateral Raise, Lying Tricep Extension, Smith Machine Reverse Grip Bench

Tuesday: Wide Grip Lateral Pulldown, Assisted Chin Ups, Drag Curls, Spider Curls, Reverse Grip Barbell Curls, Forearm Wrist Curls

Wednesday: Squat, Hack Squat, Leg Curls, Standing Calf Raises, Cable Ys, Barbell Shrugs

Thursday: Incline DB Press, Cable Crossovers, Standing DB Press, Kneeling Face Pulls, Rope Tricep Pushdowns, Overhead Rope Tricep Extensions

Friday: Chest Supported Row, Assisted Pull Up, Barbell Curl, Incline DB Curl, Reverse Grip DB Curl, Reverse Grip Wrist Curls

Saturday: Leg Press, Glute Ham Raise, Seated Calf Raise, Hang Clean, Prone Press

Sunday: OFF

Run it for 6 weeks. You'll learn how to workout at a fast pace, and perfect good form. I run it for 6 weeks every year, and just got done with my most recent 6 week cycle and its a great way to disrupt your body.",941,3,0.5576000213623047,"people, feminist, sex, year, well, live, actually, let, question, great",3

So you're at the point in life where you feel like you ought to start getting shit figured out, but somehow--almost certainly due to your own ignorance and sloth--things just never started coming together for you, and you spend all your free time playing Fortnite and masturbating. I can't do anything about your sloth, but after reading this post, hopefully you won't be quite so ignorant.

Getting your shit together involves a three-pronged attack.

**ONE: GET YOUR UNDERLYING STATS UP**

Part of the reason you feel so anxious and helpless is because you have it in your head that you're worthless. Maybe not *completely* worthless, but other people your age are miles better than you, and both you and they know it. Before you can start telling yourself, ""Fuck those people, I know I'm awesome"" you have to be somewhat awesome, or at least well on your way there. Your tasks are:

* Take school seriously. Keep those grades high.
* Lift weights. Eat a diet high in protein. Add muscle. Shed body fat. If you're a giant fatass, cut back to one meal a day, low carbs.
* Dress better. Get a halfway decent haircut. I don't care if you decide to sit on your ass all day and not talk to anybody, but you aren't going to look like a total slob doing it.
* Clean up your room, your locker, your car. You might be ashamed of yourself, but there's no reason to be ashamed of the space you inhabit. Stop sabotaging yourself; it's not that fucking difficult to be tidy.
* This can come a little bit down the road, but learn how to cook. If you don't know how to change your oil, you can take it to a mechanic and be pretty sure they'll do a competent job. If you don't know how to nourish yourself, you can go to a restaurant, and while they may do a competent job of making your taste buds happy, they sure as hell aren't going to make sure your body is fueling itself with the correct mix of macronutrients. Learning to make cheap, healthy food taste good will do so much to improve your day-to-day experience that it's unreal.

**TWO: GET YOUR HEADSPACE RIGHT**

Most of you assholes have convinced yourself that you have some kind of depression. Maybe you do, maybe you don't, but either way, your batteries are probably sitting on low. That means you aren't going to want to do much of anything. OK, fine. You're going to have a lot of free time. I don't care what you fill it with, but *stop filling it with crap*. The key is to avoid short-term dopamine hits, because those will make your brain chemistry even worse.

* No porn. No elaborate jack-off sessions. Take two minutes every few days to check that the ol' prostate is still working, then move on with your day; don't weave some elaborate fantasy out of it.
* I'll say it again, no porn. Seriously. That shit rewires your brain. You want to get horny when you see a cute girl your age wearing a nice outfit, not inure yourself to the female form so much that you can only get hard if you're watching a dozen black dudes in horse masks tag-team a pregnant midget. That's what happens when the ""regular stuff"" stops doing it for you. And the ""regular stuff"" isn't that fucking regular anyway.
* No videogames. For most of you, this will be harder to cut than porn, if not downright impossible. So let's say no more than 30 minutes to start with. And if you're going to play, try to play with someone that you know rather than just sitting there alone. The more you start getting your other shit together, the more you're going to realize videogames are a giant waste of time unless they're a social activity. (And the more you start moving in social circles that have successful people in them, the more you're going to realize that winners do other things besides play videogames when they get together, but that's an epiphany for a later date.)
* No caffeine. Caffeine fucks your sleep. Now, you aren't going to be able to cold-turkey porn, videogames, and caffeine all at once, and I'd put caffeine at the bottom of that list, but coffee is a crutch, and nobody learns how to walk--much less run--if they're stuck relying on a crutch. If you're drinking soda, cut that shit immediately, though... it's about the worst stuff you can possibly fuel your body with, and it'll rot the teeth out of your head.
* Get off Reddit. Or at least unsubscribe from subs where the whole idea is to point at people and laugh at how stupid they are. Same thing goes for ""outrage porn"" that reinforces how dumb/evil/corrupt the people on the opposite side of the political spectrum are. How the fuck does that help you get in a frame of mind to succeed?
* Ditto the YouTube videos you watch and the books you read. Watch, listen to, and learn from people that you *admire*, not people that you disdain. There are lots of people out there that do have their shit together, and they're more than willing to tell you how they did it *for free*. In this day and age, the only excuse for not knowing how to do some basic shit is not having the willingness to seek it out.
* Don't binge Netflix shows.
* **YES** to reading, exercise, yoga, walking the dog, hobbies like painting or woodworking where you are making something in the real world, a part-time job, doing chores, writing, volunteering. Stop thinking you don't have time to do stuff. Almost all of you are wasting 4+ hours a day between videogames, Reddit, YouTube, PornHub, and Netflix. If you set yourself a rule to avoid all that crap, you'd be amazed how much of your day still needs to be filled with something. You can make it something worthwhile.
* To elaborate on those last two bullets, do you know how many basic bitches--both male and female--are on dating apps thinking that the stuff that they *consume* is what defines their personality, rather than the stuff they *produce*? It is not to your credit that you like *The Office*. A retarded turtle could like *The Office.* Define yourself by what you're able to *do*, not by what other people have made.
* Get more sleep. That means quality sleep when it's dark outside, not lying in bed until fucking noon. Don't keep your phone or your laptop within ten feet of your bed. Don't read them in bed, ever. If it's 10:30 at night and you aren't tired, that means you should have been more physically active during the day. You can simulate the effect by taking a long, cold shower. Stand under the water until your teeth are chattering, then stay there for another 7-8 minutes.

**THREE: UNCALCIFY YOURSELF SOCIALLY**

Here's something a lot of people don't realize. In the absence of major trauma like going to war or losing a parent (and no, losing a girlfriend is nowhere near being in the same ballpark; women are replaceable), once you've broken through a particular type of social anxiety, it's gone forever. There's little to no backsliding. Exposure therapy is the thing. Go do shit that scares you a little bit. It might take three or four times before it stops scaring you at all, but once that problem is solved it's fucking solved for good.

Go talk to people just for shits and gigs. Tell a stranger at the park you like their shirt. Sign up for stuff that you have a legitimate interest in, even if you suck right now and don't know anybody who'll be there. Work out at the gym and then strip down naked and take a shower in front of people. This stuff if only difficult because you have a mental block--chip away at the block; it doesn't grow back.

Now let's talk a little bit about alcohol and weed. A lot of people will tell you that alcohol and weed will help loosen you up, while other people will tell you that weed and alcohol are vices that distract way too many people away from their purpose. Both sides are correct; this is a nuanced subject.

* Will these drugs open you up socially? Yes. (Though weed can also make you a paranoid wreck and keep you inside on the couch.)
* Do these drugs give your charisma score a boost? No. If you can't talk to women because you have social anxiety but are otherwise an interesting person, alcohol might help open you up. If women don't want to talk to you because you're a boring fuck, alcohol won't help at all.
* Should you go to a social event where there'll be drinking and smoking? Maybe. Is it a chill environment with people you trust? Then probably. If you get caught, are you going to lose your job or get kicked off the track team? Then probably not.
* Are you a giant pussy if you don't drink or smoke? At any one time, no. But over the course of your entire young adulthood, yeah you probably are. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that you're a pussy *because* you don't drink or smoke. I'm saying that you're probably a pussy in general, and not drinking or smoking is just a symptom of that. Going out and getting drunk might help you uncalcify yourself socially, but it's a small part in getting your shit together, and learning how to not be a pussy in general is a much more important thing to learn. In fact, if you lean into weed or alcohol too hard, it becomes counterproductive. Speaking of which...
* Is getting high or drunk an accomplishment? No! This is one that took me a long time to learn. In my teens, I was a pussy-ass introvert with social anxiety. As I improved, I found myself with more and more plans to go out on Friday and Saturday nights. At first, getting drunk with friends seemed like a pretty cool achievement, since it was something I never had the balls to do in high school. But as you take stock of What Did I Accomplish This Week, let me tell you, getting hammered doesn't belong anywhere near that list beyond maybe the first time.

**LASTLY**

Don't be too hard on yourself. Don't get lazy, but as long as you're getting better at *something* over the course of any given 3-4 day period, you're on the right track. You don't have to do everything at once. What will kill you is fucking backsliding. Don't backslide. Though inevitably you will here and there. When that happens, don't throw your hands up and think all is lost and go back to the sack of shit you were before. Move past it and keep plugging away. Progress isn't linear. Don't get discouraged. It does get easier. Like they say, nothing succeeds like success. Winning at life produces a positive feedback loop. The more shit you get under your control, the easier everything else becomes.

It's a psychological explanation on why more and more men are becoming feminist soyboy bitches. And it transitions right into big tech's current war on conservative/anti-globablist/anti-feminist ideas/thoughts/speech in today's time.

**BEGINNINGS**

I believe for most men, their values and ideology are formed while they are teenage boys in middle school and high school. I think most feminist/soyboy losers are the ones who were outcasts in school, or the ones who would be ""stuffed into lockers"" by the popular kids. They were not a part of the popular crowd. They didn't play sports and they weren't athletically gifted. They participated in fringe activities like video games, dungeons and dragons, band, and other ""nerd"" activities. Their friends were also in the same boat. 

These men had utter disdain for the popular crowd in their school. They were mad the popular crowd got the attention, the accolades, the trophies, and most importantly, the attention of the highest value women. They were mad that the praise went to guys who accomplished things like playing sports well, instead of intellectual accomplishments. 

However, they know damn well if they had the ability, they would have been perfectly fine with being an athletic achiever and winning those trophies, medals, and glory. They are just jealous it wasn't them. 

**THE QUESTION**

""Why the fuck are these women paying so much attention to these jock losers instead of me? I actually achieve things. I get good grades, I participate in sophisticated, intellectual hobbies, and am just intellectually superior to these guys. Fuck them!"" They would think to themselves.

These guys knew they were never going to complete with Chad on the playing ground of athletics, or strength, or looks, or size, or masculinity, or any of that. Therefore, the soyboy realized the only way he could gain the upper ground on Chad was by claiming the moral high ground. They go the ultra liberal, SJW route and now can claim some form of superiority over Chad. 

**THE MORAL HIGH GROUND**

""He may have all the medals and trophies, but I am a better human being because I care, you see""

Now armed with a newfound sense of moral superiority to go with his intellectual superiority, the SJW soyboy now attempts to compete in the sexual market place with this ""ace"" up his sleeve. However, he gets the same results. Most high value women aren't interested. Even the lower value women aren't really that interested. The soyboy can only dismiss these women who reject him as ""basic bitches who don't know what they want"" for so long. 

Instead of realizing the fault in his ways, the soyboy believes its because he isn't progressive enough, isn't feminist enough, isn't ""woke"" enough. He decides to double, triple, quadruple down on his liberal feminist SJW ideology. This causes it to literally become a religion for him. 

**LINKAGE**

The liberal feminist soyboy now links everything he hates - to conservative ideology. The popular crowd at school? They must be evil conservatives. The jocks? I hate them, therefore they must be hateful bigots. He paints his real life opposition in the same light as his political opposition. Therefore, the way to crush them is politically. Not only is his hyper liberal feminist SJW ideology going to save the world and usher in utopia, its also going to crush his enemies from high school. He will finally get his revenge from getting stuffed into lockers by these guys and those guys stealing the girls. 

**THE MISSION**

When your political views are literally your religion like they are for liberal SJW feminists, if you do not hold the same political views, you must be evil. You must be hateful. How could you possibly hold such horrible views that are not inline with my ~~religion~~ political views? Therefore, the mission must be to save the world from such views ""for the greater good"".

You must be re-educated. We must show you the truth. All forms of dissent must be silenced so no more minds are corrupted. We can not have people on this planet with such backward views. 

Tactics employed via the mission are doxxing people, joining groups like Antifa, blackmailing people, running social justice outrage campaigns, protesting, getting people fired from their jobs for wrongthink, and so on. 

If they do the mission correctly, they will be praised by their fellow SJWs and a fawning media. This will give them the glory and heroic dopamine rush they have always craved and missed out on by not being good at sports in high school. 

**THE PROBLEM WITH THE MISSION**

The problem with The Mission, is that its not motivated by compassion. Christian Evangelicals, for example, when they want to preach the gospel and win people over to Christianity, its done out of love and compassion(for most evangelicals anyway). For these hyper SJW liberal feminists, though, its not done out of compassion. It's done out of vengeance. Disdain. Hate. If they win people over to their side, great, but its more about revenge and payback. It's about destroying the guys who they hated in high school. Everything they hate politically becomes a proxy stand in for their high school enemies and oppressors. They are one in the same. This dopamine rush of revenge is far sweeter than the one for nobility. 

**HOW BIG TECH TIES IN**

Big tech ties in perfectly here. Let's be real. Most big tech workers were the nerds in high school. They were the oppressed. They were the ones stuffed in lockers. Now they are armed with all this power. Whether it be reddit admins, reddit power mods, Google admins, Facebook moderators, you name it. They have the power to really make a difference for ""The Mission"" that the normal person can't. They can ban people, censor ideologies and ideas, deplatform people, and silence ideology they don't like. Because they link ideology they don't like to their high school oppressors, it gives them satisfactory revenge, as well as making them appear noble to their fellow like minded individuals and as if they are ""saving the world"". Example, they will use platitudes like ""Muh, if you could have stopped Hitler, muh, would you have done whatever you could?""

I guarantee you the individuals who quarantined TRP and The\_Donald did it because they view us as a representation of their high school oppressors. Yeah, they could brag to their fellow SJW friends and the fawning media about what they did, to get the nobility ""heroic"" dopamine rush that they could never get in school by playing sports. But that's not as satisfying as the revenge dopamine rush they get from it. The dopamine rush they get for finally getting ""even"" with their high school oppressors and the ones who got the girls instead of them.",939,3,0.4641000032424927,"people, feminist, sex, year, well, live, actually, let, question, great",3

Women were misled into a losing ideology, falling into a path of jealousy, pity and misery for many years.

I would buy one pair at a time, and every. single. time. something bad would happen to them. 

One pair broke. One pair was stolen. One pair got sat on. One pair got scratched up.

Every time I would get angry as I felt the financial impact of my poor decisions, fuck ups and shitty luck. Sometimes a pair had been discontinued and I would never see them again.

I loved and lost pair after pair. The brutal cycle seemed infinite.

Then one day, when I had lost my latest pair, I was at a festival and someone handed me a cheap pair of promotional sunglasses. 

Suddenly I saw the world through brand new lenses.

I took the new shades home. Wore them in my car. Tossed them across the room with reckless abandon. I scratched them, and didn’t care. This was great!

I did not care. Not caring was nice. I fell in love with not caring.

Then one day I wore them out to party. I had a blast. I was relaxed with nothing to worry about. 

I woke up the next morning and my glasses were gone. Oh well... wait... what is that??

That horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach came back. I had grown attached to this pair just like the old.

I thought I had found the solution to rid myself of this pain and anxiety. What could I do? 

MY sunglasses I loved so much were gone. I could fix this.

So I went online and found myself another cheap pair of wayfarers and all was good in the universe - or so I thought.

Then the first time I went out drinking, I felt a concern to protect my sunglasses. Why wouldn’t this feeling go away???

Somebody would pick them up off the counter and put them on, I would get angry and protective. But these were cheap sunglasses, what gives? I thought I didn’t care. 

One time someone put them on and broke them. I was irrationally mad. 

Then it hit me. I should buy multiple pairs! That way if anything happens to one pair, I would always have a backup.

I bought multiple pairs of the same style and things got a little bit better.

This was years ago. Over time I have become a collector cheap sunglasses. Every time I see a pair I like, I make a small investment and pick them up. I toss them around, sit on them, throw them on the ground and break them if I feel so inclined.

One day I wear wayfarers, one day it’s aviators, one day it’s something a little more sporty. It’s always different, always interesting, and always low stress.

You guys getting outraged at the recent post about a guy fucking his best friend's wife are revealing **how little you know about women.** Women are not just capable but eager to engage in the most degraded shit. TRP is about realizing the TRUTH about women and the world, not about your morals.

You might think the following is just a humblebrag, but there are Red Pill lessons embedded throughout.

&nbsp;

How I pulled a long con seduction on my wife's best friend (now best enemy) and my best friend's girlfriend, and **put ZERO effort into it.**
-

This happened many years ago. Sweet Tits moved to town, needed a place to stay, and glommed on to my best friend and moved right in. What was the rush, she wondered later when she met me, but it was too late. So she spent the next year having to watch me go through a roster of every hot chick in the scene. All she could do was offer sexual innuendo, in which I was glad to partake.

When I heard that she reported significant ""sexual tension"" between us (really?) I knew it was just a matter of time, and I didn't particularly care how much time.

I moved away, but we still visited all the time (he was my best friend, and she became my wife's best friend) and over the years, the sexual tension remained. The greeting hugs and the goodbye hugs got longer and closer. She can't make a move, for fear of rejection by all three of us. Meanwhile, I find the situation hilarious.

TEN FUCKING YEARS LATER, I drop them off at the airport, and the goodbye hug includes side-boob, which she offered. And it's on.

TWO FUCKING YEARS LATER, she leans over to pick something up and shows me, not just cleavage, but the entirety of her sweet tits. *But,* she senses I didn't see (I did) because I might have been moving a magazine in front of me. So she leans over to *pick up the same fucking thing* to show me everything again.

The poor thing is in agony, and I'm not a cruel person; her boyfriend my best friend is out of the picture now. Milling about the house, we round a corner into each other. Eyes meet. **I just pulled her in for a kiss.** We had a laugh about the side-boob, from 2 years before; of course she remembered.

The fact that everybody else was right in the next room was apparently not a problem.

Some general advice for this kind of situation: **the first order of business, after the initial kiss, is a blow job.** Or two. Not intercourse first. I'll have to think about it and figure out why, but that's the way it is.

So, the next day, while everybody else is lounging outside, I ask/bet/challenge her: can you make me cum in two minutes? Yes, yes she can. 

Next order of business is the natural act, but I don't make any actual plans for it -- as I said, **I put ZERO effort in.** I tell her to meet me on campus after I'm done teaching. She arrives in a long flowing skirt. Carrying a blanket. In the middle of the day, we go lounge in a nature area, not secluded, about 30 meters from sidewalks full of eager young students. 

In full view of whoever wants to see, she undoes my pants and gets on top of me. She's not wearing panties. With the skirt draped over me, it might look innocent, but the way she was moving was pretty obvious.

That's how it began, and it ended shortly after, in her sister's bed. 

But not before my wife came downstairs in the middle of the night to see us on the sofa, with my arm around her. How do you get out of a situation like that? You play innocent, say it was nothing. Wife regularly brought that up to get mad about whatever, I eventually gaslighted her into thinking she imagined it. LOL

&nbsp;

I want to emphasize this lesson with the articulate words of /u/dr_warlock . 

> Most people won't upvote because it's not relateable. This is the SMP most will never see. Between the humble brags (it was but who cares), there's an underlying theme... **what women are willing to do vs what they and society have you believe.** Always good to have posts that remind you of it.

Think about what this woman was willing to do: cheat with the husband of her best friend; blow job in the house with everybody right outside; first sex is in broad daylight in public; last sex is in her sister's bed.

I love em raunchy like that.

I'm a long time lurker on this sub, and agree with pretty much everything you guys talk about. There is one major thing that I don't understand though... Many of you emphasize how women these days are only good for their looks, and thus bring no real value to relationship. Many of you agree that women ""infiltrating"" the workforce is a BAD THING. You wish for a time before ""modern"" feminism, where women are stay at home moms. This is a huge part of MGTOW that I've seen constantly come up.

With that in mind, isn't a huge part of MGTOW flawed? If women aren't in the workforce, they provide LESS value to a relationship. If they don't have equal opportunity (workplace involvement) to men, then they just have the rely on their looks EVEN MORE. Once again, many of you complain that women just have to be pretty in this day-n-age, and they can can get a way higher (perceived) value partner. See how this is sort of a paradox?

If it were the 1950s, would you guys complain about how women are worthless and only good for their looks? What exactly is the ""ideal"" woman to you guys? A stay at home mom? Well if that's the case, she is pretty much a gold digger and is therefor worthless in your guys eyes. What about a hard working female who competes in the workforce? Well it seems like you guys wouldn't want that either (for a magnitude of reasons based on MGTOW believes)...

Can you guys understand the confusion I have here? I am extremely red pilled and am definitely MGTOW. I see so much truth in the posts I see everyday on this reddit. However, this ""paradox"" is really bothering me. I'm questioning if mine (and your guys') standards are too high for women. What do we really want?

&#x200B;

**EDIT: Thank you everyone for your responses. It seems that I was confused about an aspect of MGTOW, which lead me to make an illogical comparison/ inference.

I have a bad relationship with my parents already. My son lives with them because of a bunch of events recently. Now I was over there for a visit the other day.

They said that it was dumb and it was anti-woman and that they didn’t raise me to hate woman like this. And a bunch of other stuff. (My dad came to the Reddit page while I was over there and I guess he researched a bit more as well). My parents are also very very very hardcore Republicans and I’m a very very very hardcore democrat. 

It ended up getting physical. I told my dad that he needs to back out of my life and that I’m still going to be a part of this wether he likes it or not. He got into my face while yelling. I swung on him and he punched me twice. My mom then broke up the fight before anything serious could happen. What do I do?

Here he was, at the gym, which is an inherently not bitchy place even if sometimes some retardedly hot piece and her friend start babbling. And, yet, this man was a bitch all the same. He cowered at the sight of masculine men, and women, well, they may as well have been Medusa for how much he avoided looking at them. This couldn't do at all!

My dear boy, I said to him. I am going to help. I am the Ghost of Getting Ass, and I have taken pity on you! Come! We must debitchify you!

The man seemed uncertain as to whether or not he should get onto the motorcycle, so, to aid him, I punched him in the face.

What did you do that for, the man said.

I wagged an alpha finger at him.

 > Don't be uncertain! Uncertainty is the move of women and bitch men. Asses your options, and then do what springs to mind immediately.


The man struggled to get a proper foothold on the bike, and he immediately crashed into a light post.

Don't you know how to ride a bike?

The man shook his head pathetically. I gave him my hand and put him back on the bike, teaching him how.

> Learn Skills and do exciting things! Women are attracted to skill and being good at something exciting and dangerous gets women wetter than ten thousand roses ever could. Women are extremely boring, and you are the exciting instrument that they secretly want to blow.

The man and I rode our motorcycles to some dive bar and began to drink with the other men. The man, now surrounded by pure uncut masculinity, began to loosen up.

She has titties as big as satellite dishes! One man said. And the bar laughed. I turned to the man again.

> Become immersed in masculinity. Once you are surrounded by something you become more comfortable. Like diving into a pool. Once the waters of masculinity become a Haven for you, your adventures with women will become easier.

The man and I left the bar. Time to score some ass!

I saw some Latina bitch with a fine ass walking by and went over and alphaed her until her panties got wet, of course. The man stood behind me, looking at women. He was strutting his chest out and holding his head high.

I stopped talking to the Latina.

What the fuck are you doing, faggot?

I'm being alpha, the man replied, I read a post about alpha body language and i-

I punched his flabby jaw.

Stop it. 

> You can act as alpha as you want, but beautiful women need to be approached. They have incredibly low self-esteem and are insecure. They could not handle it if you rejected them. And so they don't apporach. They are a lot like most of you, a bitch, afraid of even the slightest bit of bumps in the road.

The man finnaly grew a big set of balls, and went up and talked to a woman. 

H-hi...

Dear God what is he doing, but then I remembered patience. Not so long ago I was a beta faggot who wouldn't know what to do with a pussy if it was gift wrapped and sent to my door.

I-i thought you were cute and I wanted to say hi.

I have a boyfriend, the bitch replies.

Oh, I'm sorry, ok bye.


The man walks away.

I grab him by the arm.
Hey, that was pretty shite but at least now you know one thing.

> Rejection is better than regret.


The night is over, and the man goes to his 9-5. I follow along, floating beside him like the alpha Spectre that I am. He slacks off at his job, and constantly shoots glances at Karen, the funky bitch with the back tattoo in HR. As he goes to the urinal for his procrastination piss, I give him a solid jab to the ear.

Hey retard.

> Money is more important than women. Start paying more attention to your bank account and less towards whores.


The man is done and drives home, listening to some classic rock garbage that every department store plays to brainwash you into buying heaters. 

Are you going to the gym now, you haven't gone today, I say to him.

He shakes his head.

I, uh, went yesterday and besides I think I'm gonna switch to calisthenics, it's a more- 

I spit in his eye


> The gym is your church, and if you are a good Christian man you don't just go on Sundays. You go to every pot luck, every meeting, and keep your body strong.

After lifting weights, the man begins to play videogames with his online friends. After about an hour I relieve myself on his XBONE or whatever the fuck.

Hey what the hell man, he shouts. Dont piss on my stuff!

I piss on his shoes now.


Listen faggot!

> Video games aren't a skill and if you play it for longer than an hour you are atrophying away. Their is a world full of fresh pussy waiting to be dined upon, and we, the last alphas in this bluepill dystopia, must endeavor to dine on it.


The man now sits mindlessly on his phone.

Don't you have any hobbies, I ask. 

The man says yes, but upon closer inspection it appears his hobby is smoking weed and jacking off.

I look over to his closet.

Boxing gloves, a parachute, dancing shoes, a fencing sword or whatever the fuck it's called.

I then realize his problem.


> Find hobbies and stick to them. Nothing ever comes easy at first, but you risk becoming a boring and retarded loser if you don't do anything.

The man is now finally looking good and approaches a woman the right way for the first time.

I don't usally do this she says

I don't believe he responds suavely.

I'd tell you how to approach a woman the right way, but their are over 100 posts about it. Here's what you should remember.

> Take risks with women, as my uncle Vasily says, faint heart never fucked fair lady.

Finally, the man is back at his room with a woman. As he fucks, I hover over him giving him the thumbs up ocassionly. Felt like highschool running trains again.

A final rule.

> Betas fuck like in movies. If ur alpha u go for the kidneys with every pump, grabbing a handful of neck while you do so.


The man nuts all over the girls face.

He turns to me.

But Visible, I feel so empty. Did I do all this work for this momentary satisfaction.

No. Go look in the mirror.


And their, he sees himself, a healthy, strong, masculine man, who is happy with his life.

And finally he understands.

> The Redpill isn't about women, it's about you. And making you a better version if yourself. Women are a secondary thing. You, are what is important. And as you improve, you shall become happier.

Just that, rights for men. Our topics are generally about divorce laws, custody laws, equal treatment under the law, false-rape accusations, domestic violence, gender double-standards, feminist hypocrisy.

You're cool. We have no problem with you.


**""Why is everyone so hateful to me?""**

You have an expectation of being coddled and pandered to.  When that is removed you think it is people being hateful towards you. You were just spoiled before and are having to adapt. You don't get to bully men here just because you are saying feminist things.


**""I'm a man, a feminist, and I..""**

**""I've been married for over two years and...""**

Awww... *pats you on the head like a cute little scamp*


**""... but feminism is about equality!""**

No. You bought into the hype:

1. Fighting sexism against women and ignoring sexism against men is not fighting for equality,

2. ""Women need more rights so there is equality"" is just playing victim, not seeking equality.


**""I have a right to post here!""**

Yes, but ask yourself why you are really in a subreddit that tries to discuss the issues of men's rights when it is not really allowed in feminist subreddits. Question your own motives. Are you really here for discussion or just to scream at us that we are wrong?


**""The patriarchy hurts everyone""**

The patriarchy is not a catch-all for all your gripes about the world. It is not the dark side of the force. It is not satan. It is a convenient excuse for feminists to avoid responsibility.

** ""No, but I really believe in equality!""**

Good. Seriously - good. However don't just say that then go back to fighting only for women. We believe in equality too.


**""You're all just a bunch of....""**

Please keep your shaming and insults to yourself. You are just stereotyping and over-generalizing based on what you already want to believe. It isn't going to stop us from talking to each other and it is just you acting on reflex.

Sometimes like to see the perspective of the other half  , and since FDS is basically the redpill “equivalent” (I use this term lightly, that sub is a shithole) of TRP,  I check it out from time to time. Lo and behold, they prove our point for us. 

Currently there’s a pinned thread telling women how to detect “Big dick energy”, meaning how to detect if a dude will be good in bed, which basically translates to “high smv dude”, there’s a list of signs to look for and things to avoid, and i’ll go through it point by point and translate it, showing how it proves RP theorem true. 


&gt; The men that I found were skilled in bed ALL had these key traits in common:

&gt;They were always pretty athletic indicating good energy and a desire to improve / maintain themselves (I know this might be negotiable for others- but this was my experience across the board). I could make out their physique before the top was off 

TRANSLATION- Hit the gym and get in shape motherfuckers, a fundemental principle of TRP.  Literally the first point listed is also the first thing instructed to noobs on asktrp. 

&gt;They had a quiet confidence- inspired curiosity/sexual prowess- not bending over backwards being corny and desperate or trying to neg me (they knew better than that, indicating they don't struggle with women, insecurity or suffer from a lack of options/rejection). Neither did they have something to PrOvE.

TRANSLATION- Abundance mentality and outcome independence, classic sidebar material. 

&gt;They had lively energetic characters- knew how to shmooze the room with little effort - a natural charisma. Tell it how it is kinda people- without being a condescending asshole overstepping the mark. Playful, light-hearted men....again indicating they're not some resentful bitter insecure depraved gormless incel that hasn't been laid in 6months. Even if they're more on the stoic side- they still have a good sense of humour/charisma shining through. There's a level-headed temperament to them. 

TRANSLATION- Cocky funny, natural banter kind of guy, stuff that men on here are constantly taught to be when interacting with a women whom you’re sexually interested in. Social adeptness too, another high smv trait. 

 &gt;They were witty and fast on the ball- they could ping my sarcasm back at me at the speed of light without any whiff of fear (This is a VERY big giveaway indicating intellect/sharpness and ability to learn fast). Basically they didn't resent my (often blunt) sharp sense of humour and borderline insults poking at them- instead they humoured it and bounced it back in good nature- again showing they don't have a fragile sense of masculinity, aren't insecure and are used to dealing with confident women. This of course made me wonder why they're NOT thrown off so easily or having some butt-hurt response- hmmmm curious! With disappointing men- there's always a hint of resentment behind that- like they think you're too cocky or they're just a little thrown off (THEY SMELL FEAR they may disappoint).

TRANSLATION- KNOW HOW TO IDENTIFY AND PASS A SHIT TEST. This one should really go without saying, its funny, you really couldn’t make this shit up. 

&gt;They were good at reading me fast and what I like. They'd sometimes finish my sentences or guess my reply, like 'I knew you were going to say that'. Or they'd suggest something I would be into and guess it correctly. Observant and intuitive, indicating they read body language well.

TRANSLATION- Social awareness, what more do I have to say? 

&gt;They weren't thirsty, or awkward- they took it at my pace and knew how to read signals and when to strike. They definitely will NOT escalate crude sex talk fast if you met them on an app- these men know you're gonna want to sniff them out first and can hold interesting conversation but they may drop a few compliments here &amp; there: they're not rookies going to scare you off or become borderline insulting. They know better than to do that. Plus they also want to sniff you out for chemistry. They were still respectful and waiting for me to give them the sign, that way they knew I wanted it. Respect is key here- competent men know not to force themselves where they're unwanted or harass you- they have enough confidence not to act desperate. Again- big sign he's experienced with women, respects boundaries and knows what they expect from him. respected in order to feel comfortable and trust him in the bedroom. 

TRANSLATION- Again, outcome independence is crucial pillar of solid game, as well as being able to read and respond to IOI’s. 


&gt;They were assertive but not in an overly brash belittling kind of way. They had a natural instinct to take charge. They did NOT need instructions to be told to do something. These men have a certain level of intelligence to pick up on that without you needing to indicate. They leap to action which has some kind of hot protective guardian vibe, like they can keep watch for you. INSTINCT is the key here. They sensed when I wanted something doing. Again this translates to the bedroom as they'll know what they're doing and be enthusiastic to do it. They aren't shy or hesitant and will communicate directly. There's no hassle or tension indicating things will run equally as smooth in the bedroom.

TRANSLATION- “We want a dominant masculine man to take charge and lead/escalate.” Here at the red pill we are instructed that as the MEN it is our duty to be the one in control of the interaction when dealing with women. 

&gt;The BIG one: they were not lazy 'chilled' 'laidback' 'I like taking the easy, familiar route' kind of characters. They had a zest for life which gave off the vibe they led a satisfying life which is attractive and not lacking in some dept. It indicated they like keeping up pace and variety- not letting their life get dull, monotonous or boring. They are passionate motivated people, usually have a decent career/ interests, like travelling and are pretty upbeat. They have interesting things to talk about, and some depth to them (someone with depth /eager to improve will do their homework on how to please women)

TRANSLATION- “We like men who have a strong sense of purpose and a desire to live a high value life to the fullest.”  TRP encourages us to find our mission in life and cultivate an interesting lifestyle and hobbies, live such a lifestyle and women will be a byproduct. 

I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if one of you motherfuckers was just pretending to be a woman and typing this up. Regardless, this goes to show that TRP is truth, straight from the horses mouth.

**My journey**

So this is going to be a long post, part FR, part story of personal triumph, part guide.

Let me start at the beginning. I've always been a bit awkward socially, more of an introvert type. Speak only when adressed to, cut to the chase kind of guy. I've always have friends and aquaintances, but I've never been that ""social guy"" everyone just seems to be attracted to.

At this point, I'd like to clarify that I'm a pretty decent looking kind of guy. I'll ofen get compliments about my face and such, yet here's one of my ""problems"": I'm pretty short. 5'6 short. 150 pounds. I love doing sports and hitting the gym, so I'm lean and have some muscle, yet I'm a ""small"" guy. So everywhere I go I feel like everyone is just a giant compared to me.

In the girls department, I've had girlfriends, friends who are girls, and everything in between. I could pickup up a girl with relative ease if someone introduced us, or if we had something in common, like sharing a hobby. HOWEVER I could never cold approach. And I mean never.

At a bar, street, birthday party, work, if I saw a girl, my mind just went blank. Not a sound would pour out of my mouth. I would get looks and invitations and all those things do when they like you, and I still couln't approach shit. I've tried everything: meditation, asking for the time, just saying hello, giving a friend all my money until I approached, 3 second rule, inner game, outer game, everything.

I know what some of you may be thinking. ""Man up and approach"". Stop being a bitch. Pussy.

And I get it. I really do. And I would LOVE it if I could. Just throwing myself out there, all alpha and not giving a shit.  But I can't. I've tried, and It's just not in me. So here I was, being able to get girls when fate just threw them on my lap, yet being unable to just GO for the ones I saw and liked. I wanted to be that fearless, unstoppable guy who just barges in, James bond Style, and says ""Hey, what's up"" like it's as easy as taking a shit.

How could I do that if I couldn't approach? Surely there has to be SOMETHING I can do, there are many ways to skin a cat after all. So instead of going the prescribed route, Inner game&gt;build confidence&gt; not giving a shit&gt; approaching and failing&gt;getting girls through cold approach&gt; get better&gt; get even more girls I went the other way round.

Enter TINDER.

Now what I'm gonna say isn't new. It's been talked about countlesss times here in TRP, but I just want to emphasize its amazing, effective, almost godlike power. If anyone is in a similar situation just please, PLEASE try this.

I used Tinder as a crutch. I had had tinder before, **with reasonable success, but nothing too crazy. Couple of hot girls, plenty of effort, lots of ignored messages**. But this time, I was going to become that 5% of guys who get the 95% of the girls.

I bought a DLSR camera (because I'm also into photography). I cut weight until I had a 6-pack. Rocked a new haircut, let my beard grow. And then I took a picture. Sitting in my kitchen, drinking coffee, no shirt. Edited it a bit, added some nice filters. It looked good. It's a good instagrammable pic.

So I created a new Tinder account, and uploaded this one, single picture. Just some reasonably good looking dude with a 6 pack. That's it. And then the magic happened.

Matches started pouring in. And I mean POURING. Dozens of girls, all shapes and sizes. Lots of 7s and 8s, a few 9s, a couple of stunners. Curvy, flat, cute, tall, short. It was just insane. In two days, I got 200 matches, and that is filtering for girls who are 7+. And a lot of them were actually approaching me. ""Hey, I like your style"", ""Hey wanna grab a drink"", ""Hey you up?""

I was getting so MUCH attention it was like a high. I started setting up dates, one a day until my schedule was full for 10 days. Some days I had to set up two dates. Girls were piling up, demanding my time, and I just didn't have any more availability. And it hit me. THIS IS what being a girl feels like.

This is the attention we give them all of the time. This is what it feels to have a horde of guys constantly messaging you, wanting to hang out. Some of them you might actually like, but there's just not enough time.

I went on a binge. Girls in the morning, girls in the afternoon, girls at night. A lot of them I had sex with the first night, some of them I just kissed, a couple of them never called back. But they kept piling up and kept on coming, and Tinder was still getting matches. I was full of that feminine energy, and thrilled of having a different, warm butt to grab at night.

Eventually, getting a date was as simple as going to work. I still got a bit of ""jingles"" right before the date, but it vanished as soon as I saw the girl and bear hugged them. Talking became second nature. I started forgetting my routines, and questions and pick up shit. And I started rambling about my life. There was a intensity in me, in how I saw these girls, an emotion and energy that almost exploded around me. And girls feel it. They KNOW you are getting pussy. They KNOW you've got plenty of other girls. They KNOW you are good. And they just follow your lead.

And this is when finally, all the TRP knowledge just clicked in my head. Frame. Be confident, and girls will follow. Stare at them like you are about to rip their clothes off and fuck them right there at the bar. Use silences. Don't give a fuck. Words pouring out of my mouth. Nothing really matters that much. Be bold. Kiss and touch early. Go for the fuck ASAP.

She doesn't like you? Who cares? I've got 50 more waiting to hang out.

And here's the beautiful part. This shit just started impregnating my whole life. Suddenly, I was talking with the security dude at work for 10 minutes. Turns up he's a really cool dude.

I was chatting up girls at the gym. Gay guys openly flirting with me, and I'm cool with that. I'll laugh and say thank you and befriend them.

Girls in the street? I'll smile at them and wink an eye. Some of them might be creeped out. So what. A couple blush and laugh. One gave me her number.

It's like a superpower, finally being able to be social. To not give a fuck. To express my personality. I'm more interesting, I'm sharper, hell it feels like I'm smarter.



**Where I'm at now**

It's been 2 weeks since my girl binge. I deleted Tinder. There were just so many girls it was just distracting. I barely had time for myself. I'm keeping a couple of plates I really like around.

I'm finally that dude girls really like. Maybe I always was, but just couldn't throw myself out there. And I feel like I can get any girl I want, anywhere (Even if I can't, I'm not delusional).

Shallow? Vain? Maybe. But it feels amazing. I think this was something I had to experience, and get it out of my system. And it has put me on track.

I feel great. I feel strong. I value my ""ME"" time a lot more. Reading a book, just chilling at home, watching a movie. I have more energy to go after the things I want. I have this excess of momentum inside. I'm improving myself at the gym, profesionally, also starting a new career.

So thank you. Thank you TRP, and thank all of you who take the time to teach us something. Thank you for your field reports and guides, and inner stuff I now understand.

And thank the god of Tinder, for being my crutch.


If you guys want more info, have any questions about tinder game of just game in general, any criticisims, anything, they are all welcome. I really hope this helps someone like it helped me. Cheers.

[Proof of my around 200 matches.](https://imgur.com/a/qM6oC5m) Stopped swiping a week ago. Don't know how to prove it's from the last 20 days, so you are gonna have to trust me on that one.

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT:** A lot of guys are asking me to post my pic. I won't for two reasons. One is, even If I blurred my face, it would still be recognisable, and I do not want that.

Second is, I don't want this to turn into a discussion about my pic, my weight, my abs, my hair or whatever. Trust me guys, it's a pic of a shirtless dude. **That is it.** There's no magic, no mystery, no nothing. If you want some inspiration, go to pinterest and type shirtless guy.

My message stands: Get a 6-pack. Girls are horny and like 6-packs. That is all you need to be sucessful on tinder.

[**I will however, upload the pic I used as an inspiration.**](https://imgur.com/a/L3OZvub) It is VERY similar to the one I used, same angles, same filters, same kitchen, same 6-pack. I'm smaller though. Doesn't seem to matter. Hope this helps.

**EDIT2:** some of you are saying ""HA! Of course that works in Argentina!"". Girls are particularly hard to get here. You can read Roosh's compendium on Argentina for more info. Also, out of 200 matches, around 30% are foreign girls. European, asian, american.

Also swiped in NYC and the amount of matches stayed the same. Point being, again, women like shirtless dudes, even if they won't admit it.

**EDIT3:** The amount of comments, inboxes and positive feedback has been astonishing guys. Thank you all for your input, and I will do my best to answer to each and every one of you. On the next few weeks, I will be uploading a detailed, step by step,tinder guide, from first message to date. I will also add some field reports and general guidelines for dates. 
When I have some free time. 

Now some of you don’t seem to be getting the message, and maybe that’s on me. I see a lot of anger and resentment, and that’s not what I’m after. 
Just to be clear, I AM NOT A MODEL. I WASNT POPULAR IN HIGH SCHOOL. I HAVE NOT WON THE GENETIC LOTTERY. In fact, I got picked on most of my life for being short, small, weak. Jeez, that’s as far from being genetically gifted as you can be. 

I used to get average results on Tinder. The only thing I have going for me is a decent looking face. Now I could either take advantage of the shallowness of this age or curl in a ball and keep bashing on the internet.
I chose the first one. I grew a beard so I looked more mature. I grew my hair long, because I wanted to try it. I worked my ass off at the gym, until you could see my abs. I found a good look, bought some cool clothes and accesories and changed my style. And I dated girls until I got told “you have this intensity inside you” and I could fuck a girl in 40 minutes (that’s a story for another day).

This whole story is about improving yourself and using (abusing) a platform where looks matter so much, if you can get abs and some good pics you are already top 5%.
So trust me, if you put in the work and take advantage of the superficiality of social media, you WILL GET RESULTS. It doesn’t matter if you are black,asian,tall, short, or ugly. You WILL BE BETTER THAN BEFORE. And it will pour into your regular life.

Women are interested in the concrete; Men are interested in the abstract

---



Women and men have evolved to serve very different societal roles, that much I'm sure you are already well aware of. I do see however, no shortage of men, even on this sub, who still feel as if female behavior is somehow vindictive and malicious. A lot of you, it seems, are confused about why women act with an almost animal-like selfishness and instinct for self-preservation. To be frank, these instincts really are primal, and I'll explain why that makes perfect sense, and why for things to be any other way would be evolutionary impossible. So with that in mind, it's necessary to whittle down the difference between male and female thinking to its bare bones and demonstrate why human men alone, from among all living creatures are prone to an idealistic worldview.

---




# FEMALE PRAGMATISM and MALE IDEALISM

To start off, there is a saying, that ""if women ruled society, we would still be living in grass huts"". Why is this true? Why are men uniquely equipped to pursue progress and think beyond what is possible? The answer to this question is simple, and is likely something that many of you already know - women are evolutionary programmed to pursue security and comfort. That's all and well, but what many don't realize is that this is more than an iron rule - this is holy law. It's written into the source code of existence. Women don't care for anything that lies beyond the fog of war of apparent possibility or immediate necessity - this is also why women are not natural long-term thinkers.

And all this makes perfect sense from an evolutionary standpoint. Men can afford to take risks and wonder at the possibility of the apparently impossible - the men who have are the ones who have passed on their genes. Now put yourself in the shoes of a woman for a moment - women are inherently ***terrified of everything***. And again, this makes perfect sense - the moment you are a woman and you stop being terrified, is the moment you do something stupid and get killed, or excommunicated from the tribe, which typically also meant death. Women are biologically programmed to be scared to death of everything, and this is the engine that drives them forward - every single cognitive function a woman has, is in service of, first and foremost, guaranteeing the security and comfort of herself and her offspring (the need to procreate is second). Staying safe and staying part of the tribe are paramount, because a woman is neither physically nor psychologically equipped to deal with the loss of either, and that is completely natural. This is how every animal functions, so there is nothing out of the ordinary there.

So now for the interesting part: Namely, why men are anomalies of nature. The reason why men can't understand the female security-and-comfort mania is because evolutionary, we have mostly been numbed to our awareness of it (men with low testosterone do have it, but that is another topic altogether). We don't understand fanatic pragmatism, because it has been evolutionary stunted, which is exactly why men are such idealists. It is exactly the reason men so often stubbornly refuse to acknowledge the truth because of a personal belief. It is also the reason why men are obsessed with exploring ideas, fantasies, and hypothetical situations. It's the reason why men dreamed up the world as we know it and built it. That same anxiety that paralyses women is absent in strong and capable men, because they are genetically conditioned by nature to strive towards the unknown, to be fascinated by it, to venture into it and conquer it.

**Disclaimer**: the lower half of this post got deleted for some reason, but the short version is this: women are cognitively interested in the what is either beneficial, or already proven as possible, while men are capable of being interested in the abstract, hypothetical, and fantastical, that might have no anchor in reality. Women are genetically built to adopt these abstractions and ideals so as to conform and remain in the tribe, however as soon as a principle is no longer immediately beneficial, it is abandoned.

Women are generally interested in only four categories of interests:
1. Stimulating (makes her excited or feel good)
2. Meaningful (appeals to her deeper emotions)
3. Purposeful (serves the accomplishment of a certain goal or process) - this includes the pursuit of comfort and security
4. Relevant (relates to her current context of reality in some way)

Anything beyond those four categories, women have a natural tendency to invalidate. **Women are interested in the tangible, not the abstract.** The theoretical only becomes interesting to women when it comes time to reap the rewards. This is why women are, for the most part, interested in art, sports, philosophy, etc. only once someone else has cleared the way for them first. Women are every bit as fascinated by the transcendental as men are, but their capacity to pursue or create it is nearly non-existent.

Men, on the other hand have a tendency to maintain beliefs and interests that are external to, or in opposition to reality, which is also why men are prone to get lost in fantasy and the hypothetical, and also develop idealistic worldviews which get them killed. The chief takeaway is this: 
1. we, as men, need to understand out nature to avoid getting taken advantage of by others, and also work on the concrete steps to applying our idealism in reality, so as to not get stuck in the fantasy and hypothesis stage.
2. Don't expect women to act against their nature and stand by ideals. Ideals are only for those stubborn and resilient enough to afford them. Women are psychologically and physically fragile, so it's against reason for them to uphold a principle as an end in of itself.",869,4,0.5385000109672546,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first",1

**Intro**

It's Sunday night and I feel like writing. This post is based on my answer to a question posed a few weeks back in some comments about ""how do I learn how to approach strangers?""

As an older dude, going out in public for the sole purpose of looking for cuties then rushing up to them trying to convince them to give me their numbers - ""cold approach"" - is just unseemly. But I'm an older dude, that's how I roll. Others have great luck with it. But many seem to struggle with the process.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**The Problem**

I see a lot of posts here and on / ask about either how to cold approach the pretty women (the ""cheat code"" method); or how the poster has gone out and cold approached *x-hundred* number of women and totally failed. The way I see it, the problem is that these kinds of ""cold approach"" exercises give off a vibe of ""I'm trying to get laid"" and ""I'm desparate to get laid."" Women sense this - they're good at that.

The problem, then, is that you haven't learned how to *sincerely and naturally initiate* a conversation with someone. You get butterflies, your palms sweat, your voice chokes in your throat, your eyes get shifty.

Fake - that is to say, insincere - opening lines with the goal of getting a phone number then exiting is an unnatural way of going about meeting your next future ex wife. It will have you unnaturally pushing the conversationg toward the number close - your unspoken goal - rather than having a natural end to the convo that may or may not have you deciding to accept her number.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**The Natural Way to Meet People**

Take this wisdom from my 50+ years of breathing: you have to want to meet and learn about new people, sincerely. I was blessed with an uncle who could talk to anyone - literally he spoke with governors and big-city mayors and men of importance on a daily basis, but would take 20 minutes to discuss the night's sports game with the guy taking the tickets or parking his car. I asked him his secret once and he told me that he just genuinely likes meeting new people. No purpose, no hidden agenda, in talking with people other than that.

This can be learned, because when I was younger, ""other people"" were just nuisances or there to be exploited. Now I see the wisdom in meeting them, learning about them, getting to know them even if for a brief 30 second fun chat. *I've become that man who can start a conversation with anyone about anything or nothing at all.*

But it has taken years of practice before it felt natural and sincere.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**What Is this New Theory, Do Not Read This?**

It's not a new theory you silly reader. ""Approach anxiety"" comes from putting too much pressure on the incipient relationship *before it's even begun.* Gotta get the digits - Gotta get the digits - Gotta get the digits.

I was at a networking event back in \[my old city\] and some random dude zooms through all the little groups shoving his business card into everyone's hands, then books it out of there. He had learned that if you trade digits, you're succeeding. But did he get the business equivalent of ""laid"" from those insincere digit exchanges? Of course not, nobody knew anything about him, why would they send him business?

""Cold approach for digits"" is an *outcome* based way of meeting someone, and it requires that stranger to meet the expectations you've created for the relationship, but haven't told them about. And when they don't meet those unspoken expectations that you haven't told them about, you get disappointed. Approach anxiety comes from anticipating that disappointment (also known as rejection) because the number of disappointing outcomes starts to pile up quickly.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**What If I Told You Your Success Rate Could Be 100%?**

So what to do? Come at it from a different perspective, that is, learn how to *initiate* conversations. That's it. That's your goal. Don't worry about the digits, don't worry about what you're going to talk about three minutes into the convo, don't worry about *just the right moment* to ask for the digits. That will happen.

When your goal is to *initiate* rather than number-close, you win \*every single time you initiate\*!

Just learn how to initiate. *With anyone and everyone.* That's an important part of it. Not just the pretties, but the store clerks, the bus driver, the guy taking your ticket as you go into the hockey game, the waitress, the lady standing next to you looking for eggs in the store (""When did buying eggs get so complicated?"" and lolz ensue).

Why? Because do this 10,000 times like I have and it becomes second nature. *Initiate* mini-conversations everywhere, and you'll find yourself doing it without even thinking. Woman I'm going out with now rolls her eyes when she sees me gearing up to initiate - but she loves the social proof that I know someone *everywhere we go* after years of doing this in my new hometown.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**How, Dude?**

Glad you asked.

Talk to everybody. *Everybody!* Even if it's just  ""have a nice day"" to the checkout lady at the supermarket, say something to a stranger every chance you get just to get used to *initiating* talking to strangers and getting out of your head and past that lump in your throat and that rush of adrenaline that stops you from talking to strangers. Inure your body to it and it will eventually stop happening - you'll train yourself to not react when you're about to initiate.

Learn how to do it in a natural setting; that is to say, in every day affairs. It's normal to talk to the cashier at the grocery about your groceries; it's not normal to run up to a pretty girl at random and start talking (remember that dude rushing around passing out his business card - was that you ""cold approaching"" last week?). Having some canned chatter that's appropriate to a dozen circumstances is great; even better is if you learn to improv based on your then-present circumstances.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Here's Some Bullet Points Because People Like Bullet Points**

By ""canned chatter"" I don't mean a corny opening line that you use on everyone. ""Chatter"" has to be (a) situationally appropriate, (b) get their attention and interest, *and* (c) be geared to get a response. All three.

Examples of *initiating* a conversation (and please, \*smile\* when you say this):

* To a cashier: ""I'll bet I'm the \[rudest/funniest/best looking\] person to come through your line today"". This will get you a minute or so of banter.
* To the guy taking your ticket: ""I sure hope \[our team\] can beat \[rival team\] tonight"" (yeah, that simple - you just started a convo with a stranger, man!). This will get you anywhere from a minute to three hours of banter.
* What's  your favorite team? If you see someone with a ball cap or shirt with your team's logo on it, smile and say ""Go \[your team\]"" and when they  smile back, ask about the team - how are they going to be this year, boy  they stunk last year, do you think they'll beat \[rival\] next week, how's the new coach going to work out?  Likewise, if someone is wearing your team's rival's logo, smile at them  and say ""Boo \[rival\]!"" and have the similar conversation.
* Two  ladies at the tea shop the other day had the same unusual color shirt  on - me, walking past them: ""Did you two coordinate outfits to look nice  for me today?"" Smile! They said some clever response, and we all moved on with our lives.
* To the waitress last night, ""Big crowd tonight, huh? You would think the cold would keep people at home."" Chatter chatter smile chatter.
* Girl  in line behind you at the store wearing yoga pants, ""what's your favorite yoga pose?"" They \*always\* answer that one. Tell 'em ""that's  easy, pick a harder one!""

Talk to men and women, young and old, pretty or ugly. It's all about practice and comfort to desensitize your body from that jolt of anxiety you get right when you formulate the idea to inititate. Learn how to initiate and it will become second nature.

You  get the idea - it's not ""pickup lines""; it's just having something clever to say to start them talking with you. Talk for a minute then exit the convo.

**But Do Not Read This, How Do I Get The Precious Digits?**

That's for another post. For now, I'll say it again - go out there and practice *initiating* as your goal, not having a stranger fulfil some unspoken requirement you've put on them which then results in multiple ""failures"".

fedgmy,88,fedgmy,2020-03-06T21:28:13Z,score,210,hot,1,TheRedPill,862,"Been about four or five months since I last read any Redpill content, and About 10 months since I posted anything Redpill related, and I’m happy to report that my game has returned to a level where I have supreme confidence every time I go on a date, enter a club or talk to a woman. Not what most people here say, right?
So often I read accounts of people who gave up their Red Pill journey and returned to their comfortable Blue Pilled ways, only to get walked all over by a woman who was previously begging for their cock, challenged by men who previously paid them the utmost respect, and insulted by randomers who sense weakness in their demeanour. 


I admit, these accounts scared me, and I was extremely hesitant to stop studying the RedPill lest I become a blue balled, beta pussy. But at the same time, I looked at my track record since adopting the Red Pill, and I noticed that it was extremely poor compared to the results I had gotten in all the single years I had previous. “But this can’t be” I thought, “the Redpill is supposed to improve everything about your game and give you an advantage over the average guy, what am I doing wrong?”. So after I had a series of embarrassing failures with women, where I essentially had them eating out of my hand only to say something profoundly stupid (usually in response to a perceived ‘shit test’) and ruin any chance I had with them in mere seconds, I decided to take a break from the Redpill. I chilled the fuck out on the overthinking prompted by the Redpills examination of the social interaction between genders, stopped reading all Redpill readings and just did the things that matter. Focused on college work, made going to the gym five days a week with my mates a priority and just started going out on nights out without an agenda to pull women. After four or five months of this, I found that I was no longer turning to Redpill teachings to augment my every action with women, and my game had returned to the way it was when I started, although it was admittedly better as I had matured overall as a person in the time I was doing Redpill stuff. 


I was no longer a complete fucking asshole, insulting women when I could, or brushing them off to make them work harder or qualify themselves. Instead I was walking around happy, sometimes acting cheeky towards them and offering minor challenges, but nothing that couldn’t be construed as just a bit of fun. The hostility was gone, the insecurity and pressure of acting like an alpha was gone, and (particularly on dates) my words just flowed and seemed to hit their mark more often than not. I had unintentionally built up a roster of women who want to date me, but understand that I’m not available right now because my Final Year in College was keeping me busy. But nonetheless, the harem I so desperately sought in my hardcore Redpill regurgitation days, was now developing organically, with all of them available to hit up whenever I felt like it.

To anyone who read the title and assumed I was a Redpill hater, I want you to know that that isn’t the case. In fact, I do believe there is a lot of good to be learned from the Redpill, going to the gym religiously, not being too sympathetic to women, not allowing them to be the focus of your success but rather the byproduct, recognition of the power you hold as a man and how to embrace your masculinity without becoming a toxic hostile cunt, looksmaxxing etc. 


However, there is a lot of room for misinterpretation in the words we read here. Many believe everything they read here to be fact, and that goes for both the Big dogs like Rollo and Vasily to any random Reddit comment who’s author may or may not have any fucking clue what they’re talking about. 
This can lead you to begin reconstructing the way you think in the wrong way, and if your foundation is off, everything is off.
In my case, I wasn’t exactly struggling with women before the Redpill, I’m was considered good looking by others and I spoke well even if I was a bit of a nice guy at times whose backbone disappeared when challenged. So I turned to the Redpill to improve my game, thinking it would bring me to the next level. 
But as is so often the case, I went from one extreme to the other, and when I thought I was Redpilled, what I actually was was an aggressive, overly sensitive, condescending douchebag who overthought every single interaction. So a break melted away a lot of that hostility and the really important stuff I learned from the Redpill remained. 


I can now say that I am at my peak in basically every regard, I am just fucking loving life at the moment. Not just with women or work, but everything. And the Redpill played a key part in the journey. While I will probably never be the kind of guy who frantically digests every bit of Redpill knowledge I come across (because for me, that just wasn’t working), I will no doubt pop in to remind myself of certain things every now and again.

Unique value will make her think you are the only one in the world, and this will cause her to think twice before acting on her hypergamic urges because the stakes are higher. However, demonstrating unique value may involve some levels of emotional connection whether feigned or genuine. Unique value will cause you to stand out and it will be harder for her to calculate the value of other men because you showcase yourself to be extremely unique in her subjective reality.

&#x200B;

# Problem Of Fungibility

I first outline the Problem of Fungibility. In its simplest terms, if A is better than B, and we can get B, as humans, we would replace A with B without hesitation. Social theorists will argue this applies to friendships as well, but that is not the focus of this post.

In Redpill Literature, the doctrine is to improve yourself and demonstrate higher value such that she will want you. However, I think more than higher value, we should examine how we can demonstrate unique and/or unique higher value. This is because as much as we improve ourselves, if we do not demonstrate how we are unique, you are essentially the exact same redpilled guy out there, and any other redder pilled guy will steal your bitch. Hence the saying, your turn never yours. Furthermore, when you stay in any relationship for long periods of time, her subjective lenses will eventually get bored, and your once high value becomes ordinary and she might stop appreciating your once high value when she sees past the initial excitement and her hypergamic urges are activated (e.g being a football player, having cash, etc etc because these are not sufficiently unique).

# Unique Value

What then is Unique Value? Unique value is hard to underpin, but it is something that makes you different from other guys. It is something that gives her oneitis.

This might edge onto bluepill, but I think some aspects of bluepill tools can be used to achieve redpill goals (or purple pill if you would like).  It is something that makes her feel that you have seen her in a way that no one else does. It is letting her  expose her vulnerabilities while you comfort her.

It is the holding of as many micro frames as you can within the macro frame of the alpha chad. To be stoic is boring. You wanna be stoic and fun at the same time. Now that is somewhat unique. To be dead serious on your goals, but also someone who can let loose. To be intellectual, but adventurous. You get the idea. The more micro frames, the more nuanced you are as an individual. Stop being boring.

But even then, these are only external frames. What you want is to speak to her internally. What do I mean by this?

A powerful tool I have discovered unwittingly, is to really understand her and her past traumas which have shaped her for who she is. I think it is common consensus that quite a fair amount of girls are neurotic/crazy, but this is not fault of theirs. Many of them have had traumatic experiences which causes them to act the way they do without them even realizing.

If you can unpack her trauma for her, explain how that experience has shaped her current beliefs, and release her emotional distress for the very first time, she will see you as a God and you have cemented your status as the best man she can get because her subjective hypergamic calculations will think you really are the best (even if it might not be the case in objective reality but it doesnt matter because she is in your frame). She will think no one else will ever be able to understand her for who she is in the way you do and she will cling on tightly. Following which, she is less likely to act on her hypergamic urges, but this does not mean you stop self-improving, because AWALT. (Right guy comes along and she might think his cock is worth more than this connection. But the point is that this connection acts as a buffer and makes her realise the stakes are higher if she cheats because she will lose you.) Owing to scope of this post, I cannot explain easily how exactly you unpack trauma and reframe her beliefs and explain herself to her, and I can already forsee people labelling this as being an emotional tampon (which it sort of is except you are doing it in the right way that makes her get even more tingles).

What is most important is to forge a real connection with the connection of selves. Game is necessary, but I think game is not substantial and is only useful for short term fuckboi mating strategies. That said, reserve this for FWBs or an LTR that is worthy. And for the love of God, never give away your LTR commitment too easily.

# Final Notes and Word of Caution

If it isn't obvious, please be selective who you do this to. If she truly is extremely psycho, it might not be worth trying to show her the light because it will be too difficult and she might cling on overly tightly to you. The broad idea is to connect on something substantial that makes her feel like her existence means something in a way she has never felt before.

As a critique of the redpill, I think a consequent of truly internalising abundance will mean that it becomes extremely hard to forge connections and this becomes even harder when you understand the nature of hypergamy. I think it is possible to accommodate some emotional connections within the sphere of the redpill without turning into a complete beta.

This is essentially also mastery of the Rollo's conception of the nice guy-asshole spectrum. Too asshole and too alpha and you'll only fuck her but she wouldn't want something else from you. It might even be difficult to spin her as a plate. True mastery of the niceguy-asshole spectrum is the way to go such that she willingly accepts her status of a plate as she wishes to ascend the ranks. From here, you decide what you want to achieve. This is just a tool, the goal is determined by you.

To be clear, this is done with the general frame of being Alpha. This teaches the aspect of being tender in the correct way. Women ultimately want a man who is both alpha and beta simultaneously, and this is ultimately unique.",864,2,0.34299999475479126,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck",3

[https://www.city-journal.org/europe-multiculturalism](https://www.city-journal.org/europe-multiculturalism)

I did not realize the situation in Sweden and other parts of Europe was in fact this bad, honestly. It looks like for all the talk of fempowerment (and today being women's day in fact), feminised societies for all their claims of egalitarian utopia (dystopia?) have failed in keeping their women strong and safe. It's gotten so bad they've coined a word 'rapefugees' for it.

At the root of this is a culture of open hypergamy that masculinizes girls, betaizes and then frustrates the boys and men, plus then opening one's borders to all and sundry in the name of immigration, without even a background check. While the men and white knights support the same as they will get access to cheap labor to replace an increasingly ageing demographic reluctant to reproduce.

If you've been paying attention to politics, you'll soon realize that once women enter politics, left vs right wing increasingly becomes more of a gender war than anything else, with women leaning more to the left and men leaning more to the right (the white knights though will always lean with the women). Whatever conservatives and liberals stood for in the past, all that is increasingly being steamrolled by gender differences and large scale macroscopic displays of sexual behavior at the political level.

The politics of the USA at this moment is essentially one big gender war - the rape accusation now the latest power play. The politics of a country like India is also turning into a right vs left gender war, especially if you look at the real power centers between the 2 biggest parties. Other countries are either more masculine or more feminine - the politics of China and Russia is masculine, but the politics of Europe is now unabashedly feminine, and Sweden is the feminist capital of the world. The politics during the World Wars and the Cold War was totally masculine in comparison.

This is a clear proof of the fact that no matter at what level, the reality of the physical biological and psychological differences between men and women can never really be ignored and comes out in actual behavior no matter what politicians want you to believe. **Deep in the subconscious, the differences between men and women influence their behaviors -- even and especially in large scale politics.**

I have studied the behavior of many female politicians, and I find that all governments headed by females or having a significant majority of females in power tend to behave similarly. Often heading to some version of welfare state where the government plays daddy in place of hopeless beta men, and pro immigration to the extent of causing serious demographic shifts. Birth rates are also low, so population average age keeps rising. With more elderly to take care of, welfare becomes even more important, and it becomes a kind of positive feedback.

So what happened in Sweden or Germany and other European countries? A large scale version of betaization basically. In betaization, the woman falls in love with a masculine man, gradually converts him down to a provider, in the process losing attraction for a domesticated housecat that was once a free wild lion, and then gets attracted to the next man that exudes unrestricted and untamed masculine energy and loses loyalty for her own man.

Betaization is closely linked to the rubber band like hypergamous attraction of the feminine for men that are farther away, require greater effort to pursue and are more of a challenge. The attraction to the affair partner exists because the husband has become too familiar, too beta, too easy and not worth pursuing anymore.

How does this script play out in international politics? Exactly the same.  First the women over a period of generations, starting from school, by taking over the educational system, betaized all their own men and boys, and tried making women more masculine. Then when they no longer found the masculine energy in their country worth it, and indigenous birth rates began to slow, they opened their borders to immigration, and not just for cheap labor.

In the process they really let in a lot of 'bad boys' into their country, didn't they? How often do we see women politicians and the media rationalizing or hiding away the evidence of the things they don't want you to hear? Well, guess which nations aren't so safe now as they were before. France, Sweden, even Germany, Holland, you name it. Take a look at the politicians on board these governments.

This process happens subconsciously and too subtly over a long period of time until you look back and connect the dots. I don't think anyone in this process is even aware that this is what are doing, but their instincts drive them on.

And btw who specifically did they encourage more than anyone else in Europe? At least as per the media and social media stories going around?

Muslims. Yes. From Muslim majority and dominated nations. The immigrants into France, Sweden, Germany and even the US (till they got tough on it) were mostly from Muslim war torn nations, from Afghanistan to Somalia even.

Your media is the ideal feminine space. Google up Yellow Journalism and see the characteristics for yourself. By the way, their favourite word these days is dissent, aka disagreement. And they are for some reason very obsessed with supporting Muslims. The overall support in left leaning media for Islam is a huge outlier, with a lot of women leading the way. I've never quite understood just why for a long time (until now) - after 9/11, there was a huge rush in sections of the media to defend it. It's as biased as it gets.

When it comes to underdogs, the tendency of the media is to show that one exceptional case while denying the reality of all the other cases that failed and backfired, badly, and a complete handwaving of macroscopic statistical behavior. You will never, ever see the governments admit or take responsibility for their failures. Sounds pretty much like what a female mind would do right?

Why do the governments and the media do this? Is it a religious thing? Nope, this is all about masculinity.

I observe that Islam is a totally patriarchal religion - I've read almost all major religious books, so I know what each of them talk about. The culture itself is masculine dominant in nature. And their track record of treating their own women in their countries even to this day, as well as the women of all the countries they invaded in the middle ages is well known. If you do a simple search on google, and check out some of the laws and punishments or the history, you'll come face to face what would be actual Dark Triad behavior, the extreme militant variants of which made even Navy Seals sweat. In fact if I wrote this post from some Islamic countries, by now I'd have been executed, horribly.

For all that these women leaders claim, and they would furiously deny this if confronted, subconsciously they're seeking a lot of raw untamed masculine energy that they've never obtained from their own, domesticated breed of betaized boys and absent men. Why not invite in the more masculine patriarchal breed of men who push a rigid, patriarchal religion, who in theory could dominate them with hard power and testosterone? So what if they're apparently known for being ""bad boys""? They can rationalize that away and shame the rest of the world for not being altruistic. Later on this can also serve as a good vote bank. Women's subconscious instincts are still in the stone age, where being raw, wild and more savage was what helped you win and survive against predators and other enemies.

The immigrants who often come from countries fraught with years of war, hardship and unending conflict would of course be more raw and brutish by temperament compared to the extremely politically correct, afraid to offend culture of Europe. Somehow it is exactly these people that the feminine leaders of Europe want to welcome in with open doors.

This has sometimes gone to the next level. Why do you think so many women from Europe and the US even became ISIS brides and then the media on top of that supports them as well? Why not get drawn to the baddest boys whose track record of insurgency, holy war and terrorism, and treating women abusively, far surpasses every other group on the planet, barring maybe the Nazis or the Europeans who conquered the Americas? I guess these women like men who are passionate fighters just because they exude raw energy, but the discrimination of their base instincts stops at that and doesn't consider for one second that they're terrorists and not heroes. Later on they can always play the victim card and get the beta providers and white knights to offer them asylum.

**All this is a case of the classic women being drawn to the bad, raw masculine boys at a macroscopic level, even to the point of Dark Triad territory. But this is not just an individual person - it is a whole country acting on a feminine behavioral pattern without realizing it. The immigration move is basically an entire nation committing hypergamy.**

**The feminized media won't admit it, but they also subconsciously love the bad boys**

I'm not sure if these women and feminist governments even recognize that this is what their subconscious hive minds are doing. If confronted, their logical brains fed on feminist ideology would furiously deny and shame you for saying it even, their own cognitive dissonance would be too much to handle, but their bodies are driving them on what I call hypergamy on an international scale. Curse the evil patriarchy, but open your country to them? Look at what they do, not what they say.

This will sound utterly insane at first. How can sexual energy influence at that scale you ask? Aren't they just being nice and humanitarian? That's what they and we all believe. But just as left vs right is becoming a gender war and not at all subtle about it, so is the rest of politics. **There is no escaping biology, at any level of existence.**

This is what I call ultra large scale, macroscopic sexual patterns of behavior.

But as these women find out, being in abusive relationships with jerks isn't fun but traumatic. It was attractive when they could admire the jerks from afar and have an idealized concept of that person (which is what they actually fall in love with), but when you close the distance, reality ensues. As it did in Sweden and Europe, as it did to the ISIS brides as well. Even then I doubt if women would truly wake up from their self destructive tendencies without a hard boundary as they would rather have moments of intense emotion (even if toxic) rather than the blandness of their own domesticated men. IMHO when your mind is out of control, it's an addiction, plain and simple.

And why do the men alongside these women in power support it? For one, those men aren't really in power, certainly the masculine paradigm isn't at all in power. They presume they'll get cheap labor from the developing world, as the only thing corporates care about is money aka keeping costs low. Paying their own provider men would be too expensive. Plus their own feminist population is not enthusiastic about reproducing, so the population pyramid is growing old in all first world countries - welfare is going to become a nightmare in the future. This culture combined with hypergamy makes a bad combination. Aim for cheap, and you get not just cheap labour, but cheap everything. The very standards of your society are turning cheap. Provider beta men are dumped by the women at one end and their bosses at the other. Who cares?

Now before you accuse me as ""Islamaphobic"" or ""anti immigration"" (a common shaming tactic btw, a lot of women in the media dissed the author of a best selling book on Islam's truths as full of hate, without actually discussing the content itself -- the irony), I should tell you that I don't hate on anyone with a prejudiced xenophobic and irrational mind like some immature child, but I just look at actual behavior and macroscopic stats and behavioral patterns, being the man I am. I even have friends across a wide variety of communities, but despite that I recognize that tension can become palpable over gender, politics and religion. Exceptions to the trends for me are just that, exceptions, not vindication. 

The stats of terror attacks all over the world in the last 2 decades since 9/11 and even before that the track record of hundreds of years of conquest would ought to tell you who has exerted, and who still goes by masculine ""hard power"" way of things. You can take a look at which countries have pretty brutal dark triad laws even today. Right now it is Muslims that can outbreed any other community on earth given their patriarchal polygamous policies.

In all other countries, especially in Europe, native birth rates are slowing down and even going into negative territory and this is a direct consequence of feminism. The hypergamic feminized nations are really at risk of demographic implosion and immigration only further skews the demographic percentages. The very reason why America voted for Trump over everything else is because the masculine has reached a point where it is fed up of this self betaizing, foreign dick seeking feminine behavior. Regardless of how hard the media tries to convince and feed you the narrative, the world is swinging to the right (and to an extent, the masculine and the conservative) again. Brexit is just the latest example. With good reason.

[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50339977](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-50339977)

The rest of the media is on a campaign to DEER it all away, especially on Google. They don't want you to know.

And what about the beta local boys in Sweden and the other countries? I am waiting for that article that will claim they are responsible for a significant fraction of these crimes in Sweden, not the immigrants! Sexually frustrated beta men are a danger to the long term stability of society as well as women as they can end up revolting and doing all sorts of shit to women due to sexual frustration and being unable to handle rejection and their own pent up inner rage, characteristic of Nice Guy behavior. Plus the ones who are actually mentally ill and predisposed to violence.

This is where RP benefits women too, as men who own their shit and have abundance and outcome independence wouldn't behave in such rage or desperation.

So betaization, immigration and raw, seemingly attractive bad boys from outside vs frustrated unattractive betas at home -- the time tested feminine sexual strategy of hypergamy working out at the level of international politics explains how despite all the talk of feminine empowerment, Sweden and other European feminist nations aren't really safe for women as they claim.

As females cause families and societies to implode into hypergamy induced instability, the same is even true at the international level. There is no escaping our physical differences.

To be fair to the feminine mind, let's look at the WW2 period, when IMHO masculine politics peaked. Masculine nations are strongly patriotic, sovereignty is a big deal, the internal cohesion of the tribe or country is paramount, the society and culture has hard boundaries, those seen as traitors are punished and these nations actively try to compete, conquer and win. All what we call ""old school"" - observe that these qualities are not valued in liberal, feminized countries. The result of hyper masculinity in politics can backfire when taken to extremes, as masculine nations essentially die as a result of excessive warfare.

Japan is a good example of how cruel and ruthless they once were during the imperial days. That ended with the Atom Bomb. That I believe was the turning point. Then everyone got scared and feared that hyper masculinity left unchecked would blow up the whole world. Unfortunately the opposite of crazy is still crazy, so Japan now has gone to the extreme other end now, with workaholic betaized herbivore men and a declining population and economy.

Scandinavia was once Viking land, would you even believe it now? 

So hyper masculine societies become too ruthless and aggressive and literally explode their way to death. Hyper feminine societies become too unstable and implode their way to death. **Masculine nations explode, feminine nations implode.**

My problem is not immigration or women or that I am some masculinist supremacist whatever BS -- I'm just pointing out how societies can be imbalanced when the pendulum swings too far to either the masculine or the feminine. The problem is that any ideology, any left or right paradigm when taken to an excess will lead to imbalance and cause severe problems down the road. Heck, even food in excess will kill your health and life.

For most of human history, we witnessed hyper masculinity in politics. Ever since democracy came along, and the masses gained power, politics has increasingly gone down a feminized slope, because that's how feminine minds work. But right now, that pendulum is swinging far too much to the feminine. We're witnessing the global version of hyper feminine craziness which will led to a different kind of massive decline now.

Masculine politics essentially peaked during WW2 when it was taken to psycopathic extremes of genocide. Since then politics has steadily and surely become more and more feminized, and now the pendulum is beginning to swing to the other extreme end. This is not good either, because an overly feminine society will implode into instability and will subconsciously behave in a way that allows itself to be taken over.

In all the articles talking about the result of immigration into Europe, if you go down to the comments section below, the comments clearly reveal the average reader is fully aware of what is going on (they haven't seen it in a gender based frame), and they have already seen where their society's heading for at this rate.

It's up to men to step up and reclaim their masculinity, and enforce standards and boundaries, or allow their society to be taken over down the road by a stronger tribe where masculinity is still valued. Well, if that sounds too much to you, I should just let you know that this has been how men always went about doing it throughout history. It is just this generation of men that would rather be society's victim than the creators of societies and nations.

I have to agree with Freud for once when he claimed all energy was sexual. Politics is the best example of macroscopic sexual behavior. **Masculine societies behave like virtual penises, feminine ones like virtual vaginas.**

*PS : Also, I observe a curious trend with TRP posts - that they first get downvoted and the vote count stays down for quite a while before the main readership begins to upvote the numbers. That gives me an idea of what kind of audience lurks around here. Other reddit users see this in their feeds, but eventually after a few hours it goes down and disappears due to endless posts from other subreddits, so they forget about it. The readership here however gets to see this up on front page for a few days at least.*

*EDIT 2 : Before some guys come here and call me racist or xenophobic or some other thing. I personally wouldn't mind immigration, but in this case the results of a strategy speak for themselves. All strategies don't work all time. In WW1 and WW2, the USA was a boon to those who wanted to escape from Russia or the Nazis. This wasn't the same result. This was one case where feminized Europe just went too far.

So a few months ago, I inadvertently got involved with this super sexy, super cool nurse. By “inadvertently,” I mean it was just a Tinder fling that I let gradually evolve into more in my head. Not a relationship or anything, I just let myself get too attached by conceding a little ground at a time against my better judgement. Before I realized what had happened, I was already basically pining for her and her attention like a bitch. 

What really got her in was she was (barely) the hottest plate I had but I also liked her. She was super into me for the majority of time. She’d hang out, and when we weren’t together she would compliment me and respond right away and all that, even send me a nude or two as she was at the tanning salon or fresh out of the shower or whatever. 

Then suddenly she stopped replying all the time. Then she’d opt out of hanging out on our mutual days off. But it was so out of the blue and I really wasn’t all that familiar with her so I didn’t know what it was.

...Yeah I know. 

Then as I was re-listening to Rational Male at the gym today, I realized what was happening but I had already let myself get off frame. I contacted her first too many times with no response. I had let myself get too familiar and showed too much interest and bought into that gyno shit. 

And just like that I’m sitting at a bar feeling so ashamed. What the fuck was I thinking? Granted, I had just moved to a new city and didn’t know many girls, but really that’s no excuse, I should have accounted for it. 

And no I’m not a noob or anything, I’ve been RP for at least 10 years. Just a moment of weakness.

Anyways, just be careful. If you aren’t, sometimes this shit will sneak up on you. We all like to think that we’re mountains, but we’re naturally mountains made of little individual marbles and if you let people take a handful from you every time eventually you’ll be nothing.

&nbsp;


I haven't visited this forum in several years. There was a time when this place was at once a sanctuary and a well of knowledge for me. Today, I am occupied elsewhere, exploring new territory, breaking new ground, fighting more viscous demons. As a man always must do, as his nature requires of him.


&nbsp;


That is the first point to take away: You are here as part of your process of learning how to become a man. Your society has failed to teach you.  You may have been, or you might be going through a phase where you view this as a great curse, and so you curse the society that cursed you. With time you will recognize what a great blessing it is: an unimaginably glorious blessing. The best gift that any generation of men has been given so far!


&nbsp;


Anyway, I'm currently going through a process of looking through the last phase of my life to see what diamonds I left behind on my first run through. The first run through is always the messiest, the most feverish, you NEED TO GET OUT OF THE LABYRINTH!!! So you're not really paying attention as you sprint down its corridors.


&nbsp;


A quick glance at the current top post immediately gives me hope for the next generation. It almost saddens me to say that yes, I am that old. How did it happen? I'm not sure. You won't be either, trust me.


&nbsp;


When this whole thing was first getting going in the early 2000s (and its real roots can be traced as far back as the early newsgroups... maybe further?) we didn't have the internet of today. No youtube, no social media, no reddit, no self-help guru just one click away. But we had the internet, and that allowed us to finally thrive.


&nbsp;


We were the first generation who went through a fully conscious transition in relatively large numbers. We had each other, a handful of self-anointed gurus of the previous generation (and since they lacked the net almost entirely, their transition was incomplete more often than not) and that was it. The only other role models were men who had gone through the process mostly unconsciously. So they were of no use when it came to explanations. Certainly, they were of no use when it came to the application of the idea of going beyond your limits. The majority of them could scarcely be called men.


&nbsp;


When can a man say he has completed his transition into manhood? From some perspectives, there is no end to the transition. But a meaningful turning point is when a man recognizes how to tame his demons in order to use them to his benefit.


&nbsp;


That is what this whole thing is all about. Your demons within: your violent nature, your desire to conquer and possess, women most of all! When they are tamed and consciously utilized towards a meaningful progression, they make up the constituent parts of what we call a man.


&nbsp;


Before puberty, a boy isn't even aware of these demons. He is innocent, feminine. He operates on a temporary personality structure given to him by his first caregiver(s); the one(s) who taught him to speak his first language, and served as his first model(s) for people. Typically, that means his mother.


&nbsp;


During puberty, his demons awaken. He starts to masturbate! And he is immediately shamed for it (or otherwise encouraged to do it as often as possible to porn. I'm not sure which is worse. To deny a singular demon power, or to give him absolute power over the entire personality?). One by one the demons awaken, in fits of rage and outbursts of violence. The boy begins to rebel against his world, and he doesn't even know why. One by one, the demons are negated, labeled as evil, and pushed back into the abyss of the boy's shadow. This does not end the boy's rebellion, nor the demons thirst for power. It merely turns it into a secret rebellion. What's worse, it scrambles the boys temporary personality structure: the one that has been sanctified by society as an ideal to be pursued!


&nbsp;


Here the boy faces a turning point. He can attempt to reconcile the conflict he feels, or otherwise narcotize himself in one way or another and pretend he doesn't feel it, and turn his boyish personality into a permanent one. Most of your peers will unfortunately go this route, our time is not yet. But don't despair... the first rays of light are about to burst across the horizon.


&nbsp;


What are the first rays of light? The fully conscious men of your generation. You are the first generation with the potential to make the transition in large enough numbers (and to be of a high enough quality) so that mankind can finally shine that motherfucking metaphorical light upon the world, that we have been pining for and claiming to have done, for the past 5,000 years!


&nbsp;


But as wonderful as your achievements may be. Oh, and btw, etch this into your fucking skulls: YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO BE BETTER THAN US! That means: more viscous, cruel, cunning, and lethal... but also... more loving, patient, brave, and wise. Loving? I thought that was a pussy thing? A man gives tough love to the world. What is tough love? Every time the universe, often in the guise of another man, gives you a stern kick in the ass. It's a reminder that Chaos is always just two steps away, and the only thing it wants is to KILL YOU! More: to obliterate you, to remove every trace of you, to eliminate any possibility of you (or others like you) of ever coming back!


&nbsp;


If that realization doesn't awaken the most supreme rage in you (maybe excitement, fascination, eagerness too?), consider that you may be well off the path...


&nbsp;


Anyway, as wonderful as your achievements may be, they will pale in comparison to the generation that comes after... Assuming you do your jobs well enough, are good enough at instructing them, and they do their jobs well enough... That generation may go down in history as the very first to represent something that resembles man's authentic potential.


&nbsp;


The mainstream declared the end of history in the 90s. How stupid and blind they are starts to become obvious when you realize that history hasn't even properly started yet! The generation after yours may represent the beginning of history!


&nbsp;


But I digress. Have I digressed within my digression? Are you paying attention?


&nbsp;


The second route, the one you have surely chosen--and if you have read this far, if you have felt your demons stirring throughout, if you have understood, or at least begun to understand, then you are almost certainly on the right path--is to tame the demons.


&nbsp;


How do you do that? Unfortunately, no one can be told what the matrix is, you have to see it for yourself.


&nbsp;


That means, everyone's process is radically different. Everyone has a different number of demons inside them, of varying types and intensities. Indeed, after you've tamed your first few demons, you will recognize that they weren't just fucking with your life, they were shielding you from another layer of even stronger, wilder demons.... The only way to learn how, is to rotely start doing the basic things you KNOW that you need to be doing. And then adjust as you go.


&nbsp;


Here are some general pointers off the top of my head:


&nbsp;


A man can become a man only by actively engaging with the real, physical world. Don't buy into any hippy-dippy, shangrhala, nirvana mystical nonsense. The real ""super powers"" (for fucks sake, how childish are some of our segments?) come later. And they're far, far beyond anything the wishful thinking morons fetishize. You can contact the dead, you say? Ooooh... scary.


&nbsp;


Masturbate when appropriate, refrain from any type of pornography. When you masturbate, visualize yourself dominating (dare I use an adverb before this word?) the women you wish to possess.


&nbsp;


You are the possessor of women, but remember, you also come from a woman, and women will also bare and raise your sons. Before you can dominate them, you must engage them with your wisdom. But only after you have dominated them (excluding your mother and kin, of course) should you engage them with your kindness.


&nbsp;


Any meditative technique that produces a dulling, narcotizing effect is never to be used as a regular practice. At best, it is a last resort type of tool, mostly used in the early phases. A way to calm yourself down in times when the demons threaten to overwhelm you... when you're just starting to tame them, they are wild beasts indeed.


&nbsp;


The wilder your demons, the more confusion, agitation, desire for revenge... and other such feelings.... you experience, the greater your overall potential. Don't despair. Don't allow your feelings to make you implode or explode. Hold out and continue the struggle. Yours will be the most difficult and longest, but your eventual success is also the most needful! (If you find yourself cracking and don't know what to do, please pm me.)


&nbsp;


Once you have tamed your first demon (he will typically come to be known as your charisma, your primary talent or skill) the most direct route to get all the rest, but also the riskiest route, is to bargain with your sex demon. Promise him his desires: women. Then allow him to take control. He will typically be more powerful than all the rest. But do not attempt to tame him first! That is the error of the so-called ""pick up artist"". (Anyone can ""pick up"" a woman, provided he has sufficient physical strength. But only a man with WILL can dominate and possess a woman... not to speak of multiple women!) That is the figure of Casanova, Hefner. Men who have made women an end in themselves... A dead end, to be sure (one shudders at the realization of what had once passed for a ""real"" man...). If you tame the sex demon first, he will want to rule (as is the nature of all demons), and he will not allow you to tame any others. You will have no way of preventing this, unless you have tamed at least one, or preferably several other demons first.


&nbsp;


If you are Christian and unable to let go of your belief (it has been drilled into you too deeply, it's too much a part of you), you MUST turn Christ into a bad ass! Remember, he came with the sword. A man cannot love his enemy. That is the trap in Christianity. Not everyone is equal. Not everyone has equal potential. Some people want to kill you, and will never relent. It's your job to... I censor myself before the censors can censor me.


&nbsp;


Dispense with all notions of a quick fix solution. If you find yourself using too many cheesy platitudes, you are on a fake feminine road, designed to trap you. Women have a tendency to over complicate and oversimplify the world in one stroke. This automatically eliminates all mainstream self-help seminars, spiritual retreats, and other such bullshit. The road you must travel is simple and brutal. It also necessarily a solitary one. Any formation of groups promising such a transition are a trap or a lie. The only necessary questions: where is the enemy? How do I defeat him? No platitude can answer these for you.


&nbsp;


If you start feeling a sense of false pride (if you start thinking that you're somehow better than the average guy just because you read a message board and he doesn't... as an example...), you can be sure you are well off the path and soundly nestled between the squishy warm bodies of the herd. A man does not wear his pride on his sleeve. He reserves it as his most prized possession! And thus one he saves exclusively for himself, or in the rare cases, a select few he deems worthy of the gift.


&nbsp;


Don't buy into any bullshit, one size fits all, diet program, all the carnivore diets included. Listen to your body, feed it what it desires, stick to wholesome food (meat, fish, whole grain, green vegetables etc.). Children eat candy and random bullshit. You're becoming a man, start eating like one. (Learn to cook!)


&nbsp;


Eat quickly. Scarf your food down. Eat on the go. A man does not kill so he can eat. He kills so his women and sons may eat. He eats so that he can kill.


&nbsp;


Pleasure is only worthwhile as a celebration (not a reward, a man does not manipulate himself!) of a difficult overcoming, a conquest.


&nbsp;

What was written here is merely a pointer, perhaps a point of departure. Adapt everything to your particular needs. The most distinctive feature of man is his creativity and adaptability.

I'm a big comedy fan.  But, post red pill, it's been more difficult to admire my former [heroes](https://therationalmale.com/2017/06/13/kill-your-idols/).

""Theogate"" in the comedy community is the rumor that Theo Von slept with Christina Pazsitzky, Tom Segura's wife.  Tom and Christina are widely beloved in the comedy community, and her affair would be a bummer.

Christina and Theo Von have both denied the rumors. Tom and Christina decided to bring Theo on their podcast to squash the beef.

Body Language Drama YouTuber takes some interest in the situation.  We can **feel** the tension in the room.

The Body Language Drama expert knows that Christina is hiding something.  Theo is pretty relaxed throughout the whole thing, and denies anything happened.  Christina is anxious that Tom will get upset. Why would Tom get upset if there wasn't an affair?

The answer, of course, is AWALT.  Christina was hitting on Theo.  She wanted to have an affair, and Theo denied her advances.

The Body Language Drama interpretter cannot come to this conclusion.  Women have never hit on him. He's never seen women be the sexual aggressor before, so he can't figure out what's happening.

He doesn't know AWALT so he cannot figure it out.

Theo Von and Tom Segura are the physical embodiment of Alpha and Beta.

This story has a minor happy ending in that it looks like Theo and Christina didn't sleep together.  Doesn't mean she hasn't cheated on him with others.

It's fascinating to me to watch the blue pill mind run circles around the obvious conclusion - she's not loyal.  The reason she's uncomfortable is she doesn't want to be called out for hitting on Theo.  The villian - in this drama - is her.

___

Conclusion: Even body language experts need to swallow the red pill.  If you don't see it, you literally don't see it.  He can't figure out the social dynamic of her aggressively hitting on Theo, since he's never seen this dynamic before.

Along side your long-term investments, not spending money frivolously. To help keep more money in your pocket, a potentially important skill in life is bargaining/haggling. This is related to smaller purchases <£1000 etc.   
 

If you’ve had your eye on a certain product for a while and saved up enough money to buy it outright. You’ll be able to save some money easily by just asking for it.   
 

This advice generally applies to quality goods that have higher margins than products you can buy online etc. But are made by local or bespoke suppliers. Think watches, suits or specialist sports equipment. Send hand equipment is another are it can be used.   
 

Brick & Mortar shops are crying out for trade and will gladly take some money off the market prices to get your cash in their pocket.   
 

E.g. I purchased a watch last year the RRP was £750. Nothing too extravagant, but I wanted a nice watch to celebrate closing a chapter of my life. I liked the look of the watch and asked the assistant the price. 

Me – “How much for X?”  
 

SA – “£750 sir”  
 

Me – “Hmm ok, may I try it on?”   
 

SC – “Sure”  
 

Then a bit of back a forth about me. Normal salesmen spiel.   
 

SC – “So what do you think?   
 

Me – “I like it, but I’m not sure on the price.”  
 

SC – “We could do it for £650, if you would like?”  
 

Me – “That’s an improvement. But how much for cash?”  
 

SC – “I’ll check with my boss.” (Comes back a few minutes later) “£550, cash sir”   
 

Me – I’ll take it.   
 

In addition to just asking, I went in towards the end of a quiet month. When I knew they would be trying to hit sales targets before being appraised for their bonuses. I did some research on the watche(s) I wanted too.   
 

In business cash flow is one of the most critical elements to keeping the doors open. So use it to your advantage. You must be willing to walk away if you don’t like the price. (I bought an expensive suit by not following this advice)  
**Don’t get attached to the item.**   
 

I very rarely pay full price for anything now. However I generally only buy higher quality items. I’ve found they last longer, look better. Over the long run work out cheaper than multiple lower quality items. (Item cost/days of use)   
 

N.B. I know that jewellers know they will have to bargain with customers and put an inflated price on their stock. So they may knock a few quid off to seem like they are giving a good deal, to begin with.

The problem with any forum on masculinity is that it inevitably gets filled with unmasculine men who have their own theories on masculinity. Unavoidably the forum starts catering down to what the beta males already do and therefore want to hear. In other words, reductive power point style lists, conduct manuals, and explanations on why their current behavior is okay. What they desperately want to believe is that the behavior that they are forced to exhibit in their heavily taxed 9-5 corpo cuck job will magically get them laid, even though it’s not and is actually pulling them down into a soul draining spiral of depression.

Sexual Selection is a means by which females chose exciting new phenotypes for the next generation. Females want the fastest antelope, the loudest songbird and the most obnoxious douchebag. They want the male who has what others don't and can thus disrupt the status quo. Beta Males are the status quo which is why their whole strategy is imitation. If you are using pickup lines you are by definition a beta male as you are sexually reliant on imitating the mating strategies of other males. You have admitted to yourself that you are uninteresting, incapable of becoming interesting and need to fool women into believing you are something that you are not. Alpha males win the race. Beta males buy trophies so they can trick people and themselves into thinking they won the race. If you are interested in seeing this latter behavior first hand, head over to the seduction subreddit. But I must warn you they are complete and utter fags.

Next we should answer the question: When and why is it necessary to AMOG aka establish social dominance? First and foremost, we need a clear definition of what a beta male is. A beta male is a mushy turd that takes the shape of his immediate surroundings. Beta males prefer comfort over abstract freedom. They enjoy the warmth and security of the herd and spent their youth being molded into the perfect worker drone consumer by media and education system. They're comfortable with how things are and dislike change. Therefore if you are pushing for change or advocating for something that is different from the norm you must first break the will of the beta males so they stop clucking and shut the fuck up. Obviously the big picture of what you're trying to accomplish will remain a complete mystery to beta males because they are pragmatards who don't think top down or think in terms of potentiality. In other words, whenever you try to accomplish anything big you will be called an asshole, crazy or dismissed with an all-inclusive meaningless label. That's okay. No one accomplished anything meaningful without being hated on in the process, just ask Steve Jobs. Extraordinary men must give themselves permission to perform extraordinary acts so they can rise above the ordinary.

**Write An Article On AMOGing Beta Males:** The easiest way to AMOG the most Beta Males is to write an article about AMOGing Beta Males. It's pretty simple and has an interesting element of recursion. The key takeaway is understanding why this works. Beta Males are insecure about an endless assortment of trivialities. These insecurities are then weaponized against beta males to make them compensate with overpriced GQ commodities, man up and get married and work a bullshit job until they die. Beta Male insecurities are like MKULTRA control words, they shut down thinking and induce compliance. My advice is to figure out what beta males are insecure about and mention it as casually as possible. Then when the beta male predictably spergs out, use their sperg out as an excuse to exclude them from the decision making process. In other words, exactly how I'm going to use this post to ban a bunch of sensitive losers.

**Do You Even Lift Bro:** The easiest way to increase your SMV, become more confident and have a higher tolerance for stress is to put in serious work at the gym. It's never been easier to find a gym nearby because there's more of them than ever before. Gyms are far better equipped than even 10 years ago. Finally, Bodybuilding is no longer a secretive cult like it was in the 1960s-1990s. All the information you'll ever need is available on YouTube or Amazon bookstore. At this point there is literally no excuse beyond being lazy or retarded. Beta Males know looking like shit is their fault and their fault alone. Broaching the topic directly or just looking fit, is enough to remind them of this fact and send them into an AMOGed spiral. Every article on lifting has hordes of betas crying how jumping jacks in their mom's basement is a legitimate form of exercise. Blue checkmark Twitter is upset that Bronze Age Mindset and fans post physique. Lifting is the universal AMOG. When men feel insecure, their girlfriends notice and look to the source of the insecurity for an opportunity to branch swing. In my experience it's not muscularity itself that gets you laid it's the high stress tolerance gained from becoming muscular and women noticing how other men behave towards you.

**ASStimidation:** while the previous sections explain general AMOGing principals, this section puts it all together in a practical way for a common place situation. Anyone who's spinning plates in 2020 knows that these tardettes are constantly on social media farming their orbiters for validation. What if I told you that there was an easy way to make the orbiters work in for you? Anyone who has been following Red Pill's lifting advice aka applying the Red Pill should have a thick muscular ass from squatting and deadlifting. Steal her phone and then Snapchat or Instagram story a pic of your ass to her orbiters with a flirty caption ""feeling like a snack."" Wait 20 minutes and send a second pic revealing whose ass it is captioned ""y'all niggas gay"". Within an hour her phone should be blowing up with angry ASStimidated beta males explaining how a mean Alpha hurt their *feeeelings* by AMOGing them. Beta males are two things: thirsty for sexy pics and on the brink of abandoning heterosexuality. If questioned tell her that you were feeling sexy and that you didn't know that all her guy friends are gay.

A lot of men mistakenly believe that being Alpha is using cool tricks to feel confident. Alpha males don't act confident; they are confident because they defeated beta males in competition. Things work in the human world exactly how they work in the animal world. Competition can be physical, musical, financial, intellectual or psychological. Beta males hate competition and hide behind contrived morals to justify their uncompetitiveness. Masculinity is competition. The most masculine animals are the most competitive ones. There is no climbing the dominance hierarchy without competing against other men and AMOGing them in some way. If your goal is to get to the top, you can't just sit around defensively passing shit tests—you have to actively compete against other men.

Nobody wants to lose any developed gainz over time. What’s the possible solution? Obviously you can either wait until the gyms are back and running, or if you are a creative brah you can always improvise. Seriously, there is no point complaining and feeling sad that the gyms are closed. We live and let live. The process just forces us to adapt. 

Luckily, youtube has a plethora of different platforms that promote bodyweight workouts, calisthenics to name a few. If you have little to no equipment at all, furnitures and other solid materials can be used as exercise equipment. 

Tomorrow will be day 1 of not having a premium gym, at least for me. I’ll be doing some bodyweight exercises and rep them to failure. Fortunately, in my home I have a barbell made out of concrete cement and I can improvise my workouts from that single equipment alone. But for those who really don’t have anything. I’m a good brah so I can provide some workouts for you guys. 

PUSH EXERCISES:

1. Push ups 
You can always progress your pushups by widening and narrowing your arms, as well as placing your foot on a chair to make it more declined giving your chest a much more harder push. Later on you can progress it by setting one arm pushups as your end goal in this temporary program. 

Diamond pushups are also good. 

2. Lateral raises 
If you don’t have any weights at home, you can always do Unloaded Lat Raises, where you just do the exact exercise and flexing your delts to failure. This is much better than no movement at all. 4 sets is a good metric til failure. Also, you can use a heavy book to add some weight, but bear in mind that grip will be compromised. 

3. Skull crushers 
This bodyweight exercise is good against a table or a solid platform. This mimics a push-up but with your elbows inclined giving that tricep some good activation. You can progress on this by decreasing the angle in which you push with your tris. 

LEG EXERCISES:

1. Bulgarian split squats 
You can do this by resting your leg on a chair and just do the exercise using bodyweight. Progress by either increasing the distance between the surface and your working leg, or you can have another chair placed across you where your working leg is on and do the exercise as it gives a deeper dip. 

2. Hip thrusts 
Pretty standard. Rest on a platform on a 45 degree angle and do the exercise. Progress by carrying a book or something heavy and do that until failure. 

3. Pistol squats
This alone can be pretty deadly for your legs. It requires balance, mastery and perfect execution to deliver a solid bodyweight squat. Progress by mastering the exercise, then carry something while doing it. It’s a pretty powerful workout that people underestimate so much. 

PULL EXERCISES:

1. Pull-ups 
If you don’t have any pull up bars at home, you can use a table and do some pulling under it. Progress by carrying a bag or something heavy. Repeat until failure. Progress by including your lower body as weight. 

2. If you have other recommendations for PULL EXERCISES, please include them especially for the ones without any equipment at all. So far, this is what I have, and with the barbell that I have I’ll be doing deadlifts and rows. 

ISOLATION EXERCISES: There are a handful that you can do that are a simple YouTube search away that require zero equipment at all. They are mostly core exercises. Don’t lose your abs brahs! 

1. Planks
2. Bicycle crunches 
3. L-sits 
4. Reverse crunches 
5. Calf raises 
6. Mountain climbers 
7. Burpees 

You don’t only want to just keep moving to maintain your gainz and not lose any as well. What the fitness world taught me is not only to be disciplined but also to set goals in the process. Try to set a different goal from now that would align with this and in time when things are back to normal, we can always rebound back to them gainz. 

In traditional bodybuilding, we set goals through progressive overload. In this case, and in my case, my goal right now is to learn how to execute a one arm push-up. I believe the above mentioned exercises can help me reach that goal. 

There are a lot of workout programs focusing on just body weights. Progressing them through different angles and variations help. Read on calisthenics. Chris Heria is a good platform of knowledge to start, but there are more brahs out there on YouTube who preach the same shit. 

Brahs, we’re all gonna make it. Never let this time at home spent just by sitting on the couch and watching Netflix. Always keep moving and we will be flexing once again. There’s no other way around it. 

When you get back at your gym, you’ll be thankful for learning what you didn’t know by doing these home workouts and applying them with better execution in the future. We are all in this together.

If you go self employeed you can pay less tax. You may have security or freedom. You can't have both.(unless you're super weathly)  
I've tried to keep the maths as simple as possible, but reintroduction of figures is needed at points. Hopefully it doesn't trip people up. If it does, get better at maths. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Following on from a previous post I will outline a way in which the United Kingdom Tax system does this (HMRC) Comparing purchases & lifestyle choices made by a salaried employee vs. that of someone who runs a LTD company (1 employee/freelancer). 

I’m going to first set out a few key points that the future information will be built around. 

1) The pre-tax salary or profit will be £30,000. This as of 2019 is the average full time salary in the UK. 

2) It is based of you paying £250 per month into a private pension. (10% of pre-tax salary) 

3) I’m assuming the individual is single & has 0 dependents. So it keeps tax credits out of the equation. 

4) There are no student debt repayments to be made. 

5) They are sharing a house with one other individual. 

6) Food is calculated at £60 a week. Avg £260 per month. 

7) They have no car. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The average rent, council tax & basic bills in the UK are £650.14 (£483.5, £69.63, £97.01)

The salaried employee will take home each month. £1,795.   
 So they have £1144.86 to spend as they wish. 

Taking food into account they now have **£884.86** as disposable income.   
 

The self-employed individual pays tax on a yearly basis once their EOY accounts are done. 

Before this they take home £3000 a month. £719 is tax & NI free so covers any complications with paying tax on money needed for rent. 

10% into Private pension. 

£650.14 for rent bills etc.

They now have £2099.86.

Of this £68.69 of their tax-free allowance remains. 

Depending on the business. Food expense can be run through the business. Think coffee shop etc. So your business can feed you. It’s passed as a business expense.   
 

Accounting for food the self-employed person has **£1839.86** as disposable income. £955 more than the SE. Tax will need to be paid if this remains at the end of the year.   
 

They can now use this to help run their business by buying assets, equipment or “investment items” This can be art, computers, cars etc. It has to link into the business in someway. So you can’t buy flights to Paris with your LTR/FWB and run it through the business. Unless… There is a conference that weekend relevant to your industry. 

&#x200B;

**A short note on tax.**

  
 Dividends - You get £2000 as a tax-free dividend allowance. After that it’s 7.5% until you hit the higher rate (32.5%, >£50k total earnings p/a)   
 Income Tax & Ni – Whatever is remaining you’ll owe as if you were a normal salaried employee. 

To minimise the tax you pay you can some of the following through your business; 

Car, car insurance, fuel, Tv, computers, “Office” Furniture, flowers for your mum.   
 

**VAT – Value added tax**

You’ve seen those pissy feminist banging on about paying 20% tax on tampons? Well that’s VAT.   
 

If you’re business is VAT registered then you get to claim that additional 20% back on a monthly or quarterly basis. It’s on a lot of products which is really shouldn’t be. It was originally intended for “non-essential” goods.   
 

It features on adult clothes, fuel, toilet roll, soap, shower gel, most electronic items etc. Just ask for a VAT receipt when you next go to the supermarket and see how much you’re giving to HMRC for basic products.   
 

When you run them through your business this is where you get a nice double bonus. 

1) You can offset this as a business expense and reduce your personal tax bill. As you have less profit.

2) You get the VAT refunded.   
 

**E.g. 1**

You have to buy a new computer for you business. It costs £409. £68.17 of that is VAT. 

As a cost to a business it’s £340.83.

For the private individual to do this it costs £409. However if you recalculate it to pre-tax earnings, the true cost of what you need to earn. Then it is somewhere in the region of - £511.   
 

*Formula*   
 *(Pre tax earnings/post tax earnings) = (Pre tax computer / post tax computer)*   
 

**You’re paying tax twice. Once for your earnings & a second time on VAT.**   
 

Finally to compare the two tax bills on the £30000 earnings. For ease of calculation.   
 1) They both spend £884.86 of their income/business expense. 

2) They live equivalent lives. 

The Salaried employee has £0 left. But all tax & NI is paid. £5462 in total. 

The self-employee has £17381.68 in “profit” including their tax-free allowance. £2000 for dividends has already been removed.   
 

They pay £396 in tax for the year. £1063 in NI. A total of £1459. 

Just by a simple change in employment status the difference is **£4003.** Both have £3000 in a private pension & a £750 HMRC contribution. No personal savings however. 

*I’ve left out some obvious elements*

1) No sick pay for self employed persons.

2) You’ll probably need an accountants help with some things. 

3) If your business is VAT registered then some work e.g. consultancy is VAT applicable. So can mess with your VAT refunds. 

4) There are some worker protections for employed staff. However these are being eroded in the UK.   
   
 That’s a very basic overview of how tax works. I’m not an accountant so these figures won’t be 100% but are an example of how it works.

First let's get some assumptions out of the way. Among those of you who will actually read this, only about one in five are actually going to the gym on a regular basis (meaning more than twice a week). Among those who do go regularly, many are only actually working a small number of muscle groups, and rarely work the opposite groups. For Example you'll see men who spend an inordinate amount of time on bench press without doing any pull exercise such as rowers to work the upper back. When this happens, you get disproportionate muscle build in the areas worked.

It was also an expression of [form over function.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ef/0c/cb/ef0ccbfa60869fc62c8359ae90a04aa6.jpg) and ignoring core build up is a fantastic way to invite all manner of injuries ranging from hernias to spinal fractures. Your core is what allows you to ***CONTROL*** the weight you are lifting. 

What a nice opportunity for a segway. Another dangerous and idiotic thing you'll see in the gym is men who feel the need to throw on far more weight than they can reasonably control. [This is a perfect example of what I mean.](https://www.t-nation.com/system/publishing/articles/10000100/original/Fake-Strength-Stop-Arching-the-Bench-Press.jpg?1377118228) Stop. Just stop. It isn't impressive, and you will hurt yourself. Lifting is all about controlling the weight. If you can't bust the bar off the rack without help, it's too much for you. If you can't lower the bar down to your chest without raising your back off the bench it's too much for you. Swallow your fucking pride, take some weight off, and work up to that goal slowly. Lifting like the idiot in the picture is a good way to pull every muscle in your back, and kill yourself when you lose control of the bar and it falls on your neck. You want to push yourself, sure, but not to such extremes that it looks comical, and dangerous. Safety should be your primary concern. 

Next, we should touch on cardio. As in: among the few who actually take the time to work out, only a small percentage give any attention to cardio. Sure you can bench press the entire Dallas Cowboy cheerleader squad, but can you maintain a light jog for 15 minutes? *Why does it matter* you might ask? *I have the kind of physique that would make Schwarzenegger green with envy, and women throw themselves at me vagina first* you might say? Because sex is a workout, and it requires stamina. No woman is gonna be interested if you can't keep fucking for more than a couple minutes. *I'm so out of breath, gimme a minute*. ***NO*** You need to spend just as much time building stamina as you do in the gym building muscles. Run. Bike. Swim. Row. Whatever you have to do, just build stamina. You need to be able to keep it up for at least 15 minutes at a minimum without slowing down or stopping. Two miles. Two 8 minute miles isn't an absurd goal, and there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to achieve it. 

Finally, I'd like to touch on flexibility. We've all seen *El Gigantor* in the gym with upper arms bigger than our waist, who can bicep curl a bulldozer but can't raise his elbows above his ears. While impressive, this certainly has its limitations. You don't want to be the dude who can't put on a T shirt, or comb your own hair without help. You need to be able to maintain full range of motion while you build muscles. That means the ability to raise your arm over your head and touch the opposite shoulder, the ability to stretch your legs past a 90 degree angle *both forward and to the side*, and any other number of movements that I don't feel compelled to list. The fact is that there are three facets to fitness: Strength, mobility, and flexibility. All three are equally important. It would be an injustice to yourself to ignore one or more of those three in favor of focusing just one.",843,4,0.28439998626708984,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first",1
fknwhe,55,fknwhe,2020-03-18T19:15:36Z,comms_num,31,hot,1,TheRedPill,840,"TL;DR – if you subconsciously chase security, you will always remain in mediocrity. Why obsessing over being accepted and labeling ourselves often results in stopping at the bare minimum and lacking motivation to approach women, improve, and grow. Why women typically have more controlling behaviours, and ***why they find mediocrity unattractive.***

I want to talk a bit about the problems of seeing success as binary, and having a safety-obsessed mindset, and how that holds men back.

Binary thinking goes something like this: “I either succeed, or I fail”; “I’m either perfect, or I’m a failure”; “I’m either alpha, or I’m beta”; “I am either accepted, or rejected”. There is no in-between in this frame. This mindset is one of the main reasons why so many guys are terrified to do approaches. Defining yourself as one of two states in a binary spectrum is an indication of a security-obsessed mindset.

# The Security Obsession

Growth and improvement is not about “being something”. ***The only people obsessed with “being something”, are those who believe that the label will give them safety.*** Being alpha is not a label you are awarded that somehow grants you unconditional security. In fact, obsessing over the alpha label is typical beta behaviour. Alpha is an attitude, where you have freed yourself from external influences that might cause anxiety-motivated goals. Successful men power through failure with consistency because they are not chasing after the warm and secure feeling of success, but rather pursue the limits of potential, and push hard into uncertainty without anxiety of whether people will accept them or the concern of how they will be perceived.

# Why you stop improving AKA the “good enough” mindset

Being security-oriented will often cause you to improve until you reach a point of security, which you will then get comfortable in, becoming unwilling to budge from until anxiety catches up once again. Beta men are motivated to take radical action only when they believe something is expected of them – they improve out of anxiety. You must leave that mindset behind. Security obsession is an inherently feminine trait. To cultivate a habit of constant improvement, don’t strive for some goal that you believe will magically alleviate your trauma-induced chronic anxiety – strive for growth, understanding, pushing the limits of what’s possible, and exploring the ever-expanding possibilities of your potential. Go beyond what the normies consider possible and expected. This will make you attractive to both women and men.

# The Security Obsession in Women

Consistently anxious people, which includes almost all women and most men, tend to pursue certain goals only because they are convinced that reaching them will finally relieve their ceaseless anxiety – this, however, never really relieves the anxiety, but it’s women’s only way of coping. This is one of the many reasons why women find micromanaging details and controlling other people very enjoyable. It’s why women so often try to control their surrounding in irrational ways – a man’s worst mistake is buying into that method and catering to their whims. Women don’t want that, because the anxiety remains. They desire a man who can go far beyond that. What women want is a man who transcends those petty worries and almost invalidates them, because a woman can admire that “unconcerned with pettiness” attitude.

One way to look at shit tests is as a manifestation of a woman’s anxiety in an attempt to test a secure frame. Most guys here know this. But to add to that, the reason why women are not interested in guys that fail shit tests, is that by doing so, you show her that you are just another **security-obsessed normie, stuck in mediocrity like her**, and she has enough of that on her own. Men with game are attractive, because they demonstrate they transcend social norms and the influence of public perception, and because of that can live lives that are extraordinary (which implies more intense emotional experiences) – and women want a piece of that.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

If there is one takeaway here, it is that as long as you are trying “not to lose”, you will never achieve anything exceptional, since you will always be stuck on a road to safety. Instead of avoiding losing, aim for winning at the expense of comfort and security. Chasing success as a label means chasing security and safety. Don’t strive for security – ***strive for transcendence.***

&#x200B;

1. Find out why and in what way you are caught up in adhering to the expectations of others
2. Free yourself from that concern through mindfulness
3. Independently determine your purposes, aiming for your personal transcendence, instead of security

There will be a lot of yelling and CAPS in this post. Do NOT read if you're sensitive and get offended easily..

&#x200B;

The ""How to get laid"" mentality sets one up for a very precarious attitude and a deletrious one at that. \~It goes against the very core of TRP which is based on indifference, stoicism, realization and acceptance of reality, starting to put yourself on a pedestal, developing yourself because of selfish internal reasons (not external outcomes A.K.A. getting laid) . 

&#x200B;

Your propellers **MUST NEVER BE** ""WE ARE HERE TO GET LAID. HERE ARE SOME POINTS FOLLOW THIS SHIT FOR A YEAR TO GET SOME PUSSY ACTION...... MAY BE.""  


TRP is more about changing internal attitude than getting results. Getting results (or laid) is a by-product of reprogramming yourself (which WILL happen and you won't even care that it did) and hence living a longer, wiser (better frame) and more fulfilling life. But the very first prerequisite for getting laid is to be indifferent toward the thoughts of getting laid. It all starts in the mind, with the awareness of your own thoughts, discovering your own motivations and character. Awareness and recognition of underlying unwholesome mental motivations(AKA lustful thoughts which make you bring your ass to the gym/workplace) is the prerequisite to transformation.

IF YOU CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT GETTING LAID AND EVERY ACTION YOU DO IS TO GET SOME ACTION IN A YEAR OR SO, YOU WILL NEVER GET LAID, STAY UNHAPPY, IGNORANT AND OUTCOME DEPENDENT FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

&#x200B;

Imagine Michael Jai White or Jason Statham saying on TV that they started fighting because they wanted some pussy back in the day. How fuckin shallow is that?   


The only such celebrity with the ""how to get laid mentality"" that comes to my mind right now was Mystery. He did get a lot of pussy in his pursuit but did he get freedom from external circumstances (true outcome independence?). We all know how that ended.

  


1. Your actions of self-improvement should come from a mindset of competitiveness/ambitiousness/selfishness NOT 'to get laid'.  
In other words : Your investment(via actions/thoughts/time devoted) in yourself should not be driven by 'Oh yeah! I'm gonna get laid in a year, i just need to stick to this regime' 
2. I'd rather have this line of thought (which isn't perfect btw) but much better: 'I'm gonna eat better because I wanna fuckin win that boxing tournament beat the crap out of \*insert Chad's name here\* or I wanna be able to do at least 1 muscle up in the next 10 days'. 
3. Get some competitive, toxic, masculine SOBs AKA Chads in your friend circle. You don't realize how much you need that toxicity(or rather positivity) in your life, they slap you with truth bombs in your face without thinking twice. They are like walking talking TRPers who hold you accountable for your laziness.
4. But The thing is: No Chad would wanna befriend your sensititve, outcome dependent ass, unless you are already improving or a threat to them or intimidating in some way (physically or psychologically).  
5. Easiest way to form an acquaintance with a Chad is to challenge them. Criticize their life style choices, shit test them (do not do this publicly if you're a sensitive bitch). Form a fuckin rivalry. Sounds pretty dang uncomfortable, right? Good. I'd take Rivals any day over 'friends'.
6. Rivalries have the most positive affect on your life. Keeps your bones greased and mind focused. How many people are jealous of you or would trade places with you right the fuck now? Any gym buddies? co-workers? Someone considers you a rival only when they respect you. Respect is gained only when you have something of value which others don't. You have something of value only when you put yourself in discomfort consistently, persistently and critically analyze your 'skill'.
7. Friendships are mostly 'insurance policies during a calamity' or 'jealousy in disguise' or \*insert any kind of selfish value sucking agenda\*. May be you have a compassionate totally selfless friend who you can count on and may be I'm wrong here. Still its best to be cynical here and have other back up plans when shit hits the fan rather than depending on this 'selfless friend'. Assume worst case scenario and have a plan B if Billy's wife doesn't want you to crash at their home anymore..
8. Got the crap beaten out of you by a Chad during a friendly spar? Good, now you are motivated as fuck, a hurt ego is the bestest of friends, you won't care about chasing skirts anymore, at least for a while. Getting physically dominated is the fastest way to get motivated and for a long time. Feeling physically inferior and inadequate compared to another male is one of the most basic emotions and quintessential to survival.
9. Have a friend circle you spar regularly with. Approach anxiety is nothing compared to a 6'8"" Behemoth of a fighter looking to tackle you with a shit-eating grin when the match is about to start. If you get used to the feeling of flight or fright you won't give a shit when you're rejected because the Will to survive is always more than will to copulate.
10. our motivations is our character and as BPilled as we are, we gotta rebuild our character and the thoughts that push us to improve.
11. The best way to improve is to measure your every GOOD AND BAD habit. Measuring puts a sense of achievement with every milestone. For example: Write down the amount of weights/reps you do for each exercise in an excel file. Every month, go in for a full body composition analysis (lean and fat both) and observe the graph of how you improve your lifting capabilities. I highly recommend it. It keeps you working towards your goal like a train on rails. Drink a lot of beer every day? Have a calendar and mark beer free days every month.
12. ALWAYS FUCKIN ASSUME YOU ARE BLUE PILLED BETA. I don't care if you're Orlando Bloom or Brad Pitt. Assume that you are not a pro, assume that you don't know shit yet, assume you are foolish. The day you stop caring about Alphas and Betas and fuckin Gammas and Deltas is the day you won't be one. The day you are not controlled by this terminology or your desire to stick your dick inside a wet hole is the day you will be truly security within yourself which leads to outcome independence. If someone calling you an incel brings out even a speck of retaliating thought inside you, know that you still measure yourself by how much you get laid and you get affected by other's opinion of you. Many will disagree with me here. Keep the downvotes coming.....
13. A newbie who knows he is bad with women and his life is a mess is already miles ahead of a foolish TRPer who just reads one book and faps and thinks he knows it all and is outcome independent now. 

&#x200B;

Example: You should eat better because you ignore your 'dopamine craving' train of thoughts (lizard mind) under control and you want to be stronger than you currently are and live longer. Your purpose should not be another dopamine fix. Be wiser (Wise = thinking about long term benefit at the cost of instant pleasure). 

**In five years from now The variety of instantly gratifying foods you're consuming will shrink to a half of what you're able to consume today. Would you rather slow your junk food consumption down or stop out of necessity. That day will come really soon when you won't be able to keep beer down in your tummy like you were able to when you were 18. CUT DOWN CONSUMPTION OF DOPAMINE SPIKING FOODS, Slow it down, eat responsibly and be very alert of what you put inside your mouth.**

&#x200B;

Lifting does help alleviate this and you can eat more than you chew every once in a while but not like when you were 18 and went clubbing till 5AM consumed shit ton of alcohol then went out to eat ham burgers at mcdonalds, then smoked some weed.

&#x200B;

Try doing that when you're in your 30s, your body will say a big **""FUCK YOU"" and reject all that shit.**  


It is better to eat the shit you love sporadically and have the option for doing so for a longer time than to be forced to give up eating stuff you love due to health reasons.

&#x200B;

When we sacrifice one 'dopamine-seeking behaviour' (instantly gratifying food) for another 'dopamine seeking behaviour' (sexual gratification), our mindset tends to stay the same. We Stay outcome dependent. Bottom line still remains the same : We crave dopamine.  


  
Give that up shit from the bottom of your heart..FUCKIN TELL YOURSELF YOU WON'T DRINK ALCOHOL FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. BE VIGILANT WHEN YOUR LIZARD BRAIN TELLS YOU TO FAP/EAT SHIT. TELL YOUR LIZARD BRAIN, YOU WILL EAT BROCCOLI EVERYDAY FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. When you come home from a good butt kicking workout, you thank yourself (your wiser, intellectual mind) and feel fuckin awesome. Thats the same feeling you get The day you actually turn down drinking beer and give up bad habits, It truly feels liberating.   


The problem with setting boundaries is that you need to fuckin set boundaries for yourself first that you yourself have to obey. SAY NO TO YOUR DOPAMINE CRAVING MIND FOR ONCE before saying it to others. Do 10 push ups RIGHT FUCKIN NOW. Do it you pussy.....It is for you and the nurturing of your wiser 'intellectual part' of your mind.

&#x200B;

  


FRAME : You wanna know how to maintain frame? First you need to build a strong frame. Before that you need to define what is frame to you?  


Frame: What plan of action you have convinced yourself internally to follow for 'the rest of you life'. Rest of the opinions/views is all but gibberish. Being a man of action requires a plan of action and Not getting distracted over trivial shit (like feminism) Read about it, don't openly subscribe to any agenda. It will only blow up in your face. Forming an identity only brings madness and suffering your way. Be anonymous, keep a low profile (if your line of work allows it), keeps stuff mysterious and people curious. 

  
""**For the rest of my life""** is the key phrase here.  


A frame that is based on wisdom, longevity of life, building strength, skill and improvement.

That only comes when you are consistent, persistent and consciously manage your habits (everyone needs indulgence every once in a while but not overdoing it needs conscious effort)

Consistency comes with controlling your lizard mind (primitive brain). So either you control your own mind and form a good work ethic or someone else will employ you and control you. Its your choice.

&#x200B;

You will have a weaker frame if it is not long term, visionary and helps you in survival. 

&#x200B;

LIFTING: This is where it starts: The prerequisite to transformation:

For example: TRP has a frame: The Sidebar. The first thing it does is to prompt you to 

go and start LIFTING. It's the first step to self improvement.  


Does anyone disagree with that? Can anyone outframe TRP on that matter? HELL NO. 

BECAUSE TRP IS FOCUSED ON PUTTING YOU IN THE UPPER ECHELON OF HUMANITY (ARE YOU?), LONGEVITY OF YOUR LIFE and YOUR SURVIVAL AMONGST THE FITTEST.

Everyone has frame. It comes from a variety of variables : A set of preprogrammed instructions, a plan of action, a core philosophy a group of people subscribe to.

For example: One of my former acquaintances used to drink a lot every day. He asked me almost everyday to join him. I just started going to the gym and was consciously managing my thoughts, habits and friend circle. He recently called me and asked for my help. Now I like to help people, it is in my nature (I know its blue pilled as fuck). I recognized that part of me and set up some screening for the victim and some boundaries for myself (out of respect for my time), so that I don't feel guilty.  


I told him to go to the gym for at least 2 months first, get a personal trainer, then I will think about training together. To be honest, even if he went to the gym for a month I would have helped him but he wasn't committed enough (neither financially nor mentally), so there was no reason for me to care.

This was a shit test I wanted to make him jump hoops to test his commitment level because i don't wanna commit any more than he is committed to himself.

  
Same goes for any chick friends that I have.

&#x200B;

Enrolling at a gym was the best financial decision I ever made in my life. The returns are IMMEASURABLE as compared to the fee.

BUT, Lifting is only the prerequisite. Once you are at a point where the reward to risk ratios to lifting are really low compared to the amount of time and effort you're putting in, I'd say maintain your physique in the gym (around 10-15% bodyfat), stop increasing weights and GO JOIN A BJJ/BOXING GYM. You know why? 

After a point of time Lifting more weights starts working against you. It decreases your flexibility, agility and attractiveness. 

&#x200B;

Girls would rather fuck Jason Statham than a bodybuilder with a bubble gut.  


&#x200B;

And it does wonders for inner game. You become an elite inside your head. 

&#x200B;

A fighter has more odds of kicking a bodybuilder's ass than another bodybuilder. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now imagine actually being a guy who has Chads as acquaintances, is 15% bodyfat, knows Jiu-Jitsu/Boxing (at least the basics) or is good at calisthenics, is motivated by long term goals, does not drink alcohol. Imagine it for a second. Picture it in your mind.  


Vs   


A guy who is waking up every day motivated by the possibility of having sex in may be a year or two?

&#x200B;

 Who is more likely to give up? 

&#x200B;

Who is more likely to fall under depression?

&#x200B;

When you no longer require sex to have fun and maintain your psychological health is when you get to have sex.

Thats the paradox.  


The aim must be to become a guy who doesn't 'NEED' sex to be happy and is non-chalant about it. One has fun in other ways. Don't go around wasting time doing useless shit like riding a motorbike unless you're Marc Marquez(I know i did). If you commit to a hobby, do it everyday, become good at it. Make sure you are at least one of the top 3 guys around your area. It will take investment and effort and consistency. A time will come when you will get your dopamine fix out of these hobbies and then some. People will start recognizing you. Hell, you may even be able to earn money with your hobby and a day will come when you will need your employer less than he needs you because you will have other sources of income.

&#x200B;

When you will compete for psychological and physical dominance, you will learn clever comebacks UNCONSCIOUSLY when you get outwitted by Chads. It is fun outframing like minded people and outwitting them.

&#x200B;

Not sure if TRP addresses what im about to say but:  


A major part of staying happy is to be grateful for every single thing we take for granted and reduce unnecessary possessions. 

But don't be vocal about it, do not mention it to any one individual about how fuckin thankful you are if someone does shit for you. 

When you start being grateful for that piece of shit '04 honda Civic you own, you stop fuckin buying drive thru food and keep its interior clean. You sure as hell don't let any plate make a mess of your car even if she is an LTR unless they're cleaning it. (You sir are now setting boundaries)

&#x200B;

Humility keeps you grounded and happy and treasure the things you have in life.

What happened to that angelic woman who wanted sex five times a day and treated you like a king? Well, for starters, she never existed. Instead, more likely, she did the bare minimum that the beta she was plying her wares on magnified in his mind because he has such a limited experience of what women are willing to do with, to and for a man they invested in. Secondly, and more critically, is the paradox of commitment: she despises the man for giving it to her.

It makes no sense on the surface. A man committing his time, energy, resources to one woman for the rest of his life is something that is celebrated and encouraged of all of us from the time we're old enough to be indoctrinated. Surely every woman's dream is to have the man she loves do this for her, correct? Why, then, would she despise the chump who saves up for six months, buys a nice shiny rock, gets on one knee and proceeds to spend a small fortune on one day? If you know female nature, especially the hyper nature it has taken over the past 60 years, then you likely know the answer.

See, the woman in this scenario, and every other woman in existence, knows an immutable truth. This truth is that the man is not committing to who he thinks he's marrying. Instead, he's marrying an idealised version presented to him by careful charms and illusions and cemented by his own pre-programmed beliefs. The real her is a dirty little slag who wants to sleep with as many hot guys as possible and extract commitment from one of *them*. The real her wants to have consequence-free sex and hop from one guy to the next until she finds the best amongst them she can extract marriage from. The real her doesn't want to be tied down to any particular alpha, but to sample as many as time will allow before deciding who will marry her. The only problem? Well, she can certainly get these guys to sleep with her, but very few are willing to stick around. And thus, her dual drives must compete and find a victor, and because she has a limited window where she is viable to the largest portion of men, she must eventually accept that the beta is the best she can do. Except, she doesn't. Not really.

See, women cannot reconcile a direct causality between the choices they made in their younger years with where they are romantically. She can't admit that her blatant whoring led to unrealistic valuations of her own place in the SMP, or that the distinct lack of viable, steady LTRs left her crippled and unable to maintain relationships through the inevitable lulls. Instead, she blames the man. If he wasn't such a chump, she'd undoubtdly be happier. And this is true, to the extent that betas are awful mates who can't provide the rocksteady foundations that women need, nor the firm hand they desire. But even beyond this, she wouldn't be happy because the problem goes much deeper than the chump she's with. The core is that she knows that she is not worthy of commitment.

You know that old joke about not wanting to be a member of any club that would have you? Women operate in that way. Because she knows herself and her several inadequacies, she can't help but look down on the fool who actually commits himself to her. She knows she's not worthy of commitment by any self-respecting man. She built up a facade that anyone with keen eyes can see through, and the fact that the man who commits to her cannot see through this glamour inevitably leads to her labeling him as unworthy. Because any man who can't see though her is worthless, because what experienced prospector mistakes copper for gold?",837,4,0.40880000591278076,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first",1

This has everything to do with the promiscuity market fully over-taking the relationship market, as fewer women feel a pressing need to have a relationship and are more open to long periods of being single and ""dating"" (commonly refered to as ""hook-up culture"").

First, a quick reminder of biology- from an evolutionary, human-as-animal perspective: men want to impregnate (fuck) as many women as possible and women only want to get impregnated (fucked) by the highest quality of mate. This is why you could see a girl on the side of the road with big tits in a tight tank top and know, for certain, that you'd fuck her in the three seconds you glance at her in passing... a woman will make that same snap judgment (gut-instinct, or ""female intuition""), but for the opposite purpose- as a means of sifting through and disqualifying potential mates efficiently.

**Game is a means of hacking her unconscious disqualification system**- *unconscious* because she knows what excites her (Chad) and what she's disgusted by (bottom 80% of men); this is something that happens in her brain, at all times, like software running in the background. Proper use of game is meant to make her take pause and *consciously* doubt the accuracy of this system.

For example, if she initially perceives you as a beta, and assumes you have stereotypical beta qualities: humble, nice, desperate for validation and attention, uncool social skills, shy, insecure, impressed by her beauty- when you display the polar opposite of these attributes, in a manner that is bold and captivating, she will *temporarily* reassess her unconscious appraisal.

**Negging, or teasing a woman, is the most common and timeless methods of game and should be in anyone repertoire.** When you tease a woman, you're extinguishing several of the aforementioned beta traits in combination, depending on the particular neg: you aren't very impressed by her (implying that you are used to her degree of beauty), youi do have cool social skills, you're confident and outcome independent- if she's not cool enough to get the joke, she could take a walk. You're the opposite of every guy falling all over her, you have good genetics, and are worth mating with.

Of course game only works temporarily- after all, this is a hack. It must be continued indefinitely, even if only intermittently (in LTR), in order for her unconscious to not override her doubts- in which case, she'll begin to lose attraction and interest in you until the relationship is completely over. This is very likely the end of every relationship you've had.

**Do all men need game?** Yes and no. All men can certainly use game, but the true necessity of game depends on the value discrepancy between man and woman. If a male 09 is interested in a female 06, he likely have a pass to behave however he wants- if he wants to date a female 08, he'll need game.

My fellow Men -

By nature we negotiate. We negotiate business deals, car purchases, home purchases, cellphone plans, if there is an angle for negotiation, we naturally jump on the opportunity to bargain. When the goal is simple, and the payouts low, most here will resort to base tactics, attempting to emotionally justify, that 'everyone wins'. I used to sell cars, it was confusing when customers happily agreed to the midpoint of our price difference as we salesman knew we'd be working from the midpoint down. 

Negotiations, in general, are about reconciling differences in a thoughtful, intelligent manner. Usually a checklist of must haves, ok having, and not ok having. We work with fellow Men and their lawyers & try to predict future issues, often setting up clear guidelines in how to deal with them in advance. If you've ever seen a purchase & sale agreement of a business, or even boilerplate home sales, behind the scenes were series of Negotiations.

So when your plate, FWB, LTR, Wife, comes to you with issues, whether logical or completely emotional, the **fool** responds by turning on his natural base negotiation tactics.

You should cuss less. *Goes into scientific mode & responds how cussing is a sign of trust*

**Can we take a break?** *Why? Did I do something wrong? I'll be better, I promise. I'll try.*

My fellow Men -

You cannot negotiate feelings. You can only manipulate them. Don't resort to Man-speak, where words & facts are your sword and shield - useless, in the presence of the Feminine. Target & work with the underlying feelings. No negotiation

A lot of us may have lost jobs or started working from home. Luckily everyone is in the same boat, there should be absolutely no complaining about the situation as a man.

I’ve noticed a lot of my beta friends/acquaintances have been lining up for welfare payments (I live in a lucky society where welfare payments in this current crisis are near my part time wage). Instead of using the money on self improvement they are all picking up bags of weed, gaming consoles and other dopamine hits.

Don’t become one of these people and use covid-19 as an excuse. This is a golden opportunity.

Working out from home is the new standard. Gyms are closed. Learn to enjoy this opportunity to improve your calisthenics skills if you don't own weights. Make sure you are adding weight and volume to your workouts consistently. Come out of quarantine more toned.

Earn income. I know a lot of people that have lost their jobs, but there are still ways to make money online. Now is a great time to begin chipping away at that business you always wanted to quit your job to begin. You need to get ahead of the pack in times like this. You can’t even be spinning plates during quarantine, so you have no excuses.

Invest. Asset prices are lower than they ever have been in recent memory, there is probably (definitely) more downside over the coming months. Now is the time to start dollar cost averaging and putting money in. Remember the central banks will shower more cash on the world economy, only furthering asset prices in the future when the quarantine is over and employment resumes.

Initiate a side hustle. The internet has so many opportunities to create revenue, turn your passion into a business to never work a day in your life. Even if you have a job, you need to be diversifying your income streams.

Hobbies. Follow your passions, girls don’t care what your passion is. Just have at least one. Bonus points for cool hobbies with the ladies.

Learn a language. It’s such a large goal, if you actually commit it will do plenty for your self motivation, goal setting, opportunities. memory and long term thinking skills.

Bonus: I went to Buenos Aires, Argentina last year and I was amazed with the quality of women there. I will admit I was staying in the rich area, but the men are so beta over there that it was easy to consistently score 8’s and 9’s. Learning the language would make these girls even easier as I was talking English on dates.

Don’t be wasting time on dating apps. Keep DMing girls on instagram to a low, always aim to be ignoring their DMs. Don’t invest time in being a girl's boredom killer, she will branch swing to the next best alpha when the quarantine is over and forget your emotional/boredom support during covid-19.

What I’m going to be doing:

* Learning Spanish
* Training hard
* Keeping my six pack
* Not drinking alcohol (I’ll save it for the crazy parties after lockdown ends)
* Working my part time job (Part time for work life balance)
* Creating digital products
* Learning to produce music
* Delete dating apps and ghost girls for mystery and efficiency
* No Fap
* Automating my job using Python.
* Keeping in strong contact with my bros.

If you don’t waste the next period, you will be launched back to reality with a new rhythm. You should have hobbies, be in great shape and have more money ready to cash in on how horny girls will be after the lockdown ends. Don’t become a loser and start smoking weed and playing games.

I remember reading something, somewhere here, about the need to move on from your mother, as she is your first love as a boy (male). As I have been absorbing the gold lined pages of wisdom from the many of you veterans here, I have begun to filter my entire world through a red lens. I see the light! What I would like to focus on, is how simply absorbing, analyzing and meditating on vital information can change your actions. Slowly, but it all starts with a thought.

I grew up in a soviet immigrant family. I was born in the states, but my parents came out of the USSR in the very late 80's. They started with nothing and now have the american dream, somewhat. My dad is typical alpha male, and my mom, he probably married her because shes a fantastic house wife. But her brain, even though growing up in a completely different culture, was exactly the same as you would find in the west. I always thought my mom is different. If I could find a woman like that I would marry her in a heart beat. But alas, after going red pill, I have realized how many flaws my mother has. Yes she is an absolutely fantastic cooking and cleaning machine, those are simply learned, step by step skills that I have also learned. 

Yes I live with my parents, and even pay rent. No one really asks what I do, where I go. This is helping me save for a proper place of my own. It used to be that my dad would punish me for half assed work, low effort, lack of attention to detail. He would always be mad at me when I couldn't figure something out on my own or handle a family matter when he isn't there at the time. This constant pressure has forced me to adapt. Making split second decisions, handling important matters that matter to he family as a whole is a non issue. Him and me work in tandem, hand in hand. Without my mother knowing he has changed the ownership of the house from Him to Him and Me. I have shed blood and sweat for the family (literally). There is a lot of responsibility handling this wealth that he has managed to accumulate, and I treat everything as my own and he treats everything as mine.

So where is the mom section you ask?

Well, my mom still see's me as her little boy, her son, her errand boy. My sister who is now 20, has completely westernized my mom. When I talk to my mom I realize, being a stay at home mom and having only my sister as a female friend for 90% of her married life, has kept her mind at the level of a 20 year old girl who doesn't have a care in the world about anything other than marriage, making babies and looking pretty. Yes she can handle her own in this life because as me and my sister were growing up, she stayed at home and handled things, but over time responsibilities shifted to me. Thanks to technology and mobile phone addiction (which I have uprooted from my life thanks to trp) her attention span is 0 and the amount of misinformation she consumes is enormous.

I have found myself frequently having to put my foot down on her and my sister, take matters into my own hands, but my mother who still does not understand I am a full grown red pilled man, that she should listen to me instead of argue and claim disrespect. I do not mean disrespect, it is her family and her household, but AWALT takes its toll. She can't use logic, she can't think on her feet, she lacks experience in using technology in a useful manner, she doesn't understand western culture outside of the 80's and 90's and how things have changed.

Due to the harsh times upon us thanks to COVID-19, my father and I have decided to up security measures around the property, stock up on various foods, grains, plant seeds, etc. Thing is, unlike my sister who is home from school, and my mother whose part time job let her go, my father and I are still working full time, and will not be sent home. Picking up supplies, doing online research, preparing for the worst is hard to do when you are already pretty busy. This is where the cracks show. Depending on delegation is no longer working and we had a huge fight between my dad and I, and the women in my house. I understand, men can handle a lot more than women, and can do more, period. But this has nothing to do with the topic. It all came down to my mom trying to throw me under the bus claiming I am irresponsible, that I should carry more of the load. I simply walked away, and let my father put her in her place. I was done arguing about it. I am not her errand boy, I am her future life line if anything is to happen to my father, and I will be the head of the family just as he was, and I answer for my actions in front of the family and the results will speak for themselves. She can doubt me, she can throw me under the bus, she can try to side track me from my goals, but it will have no effect as I only answer to other men.

TL;DR

At one point you grow out of being your moma's boy, her errand boy, her whatever boy. You answer to yourself, to other men even, but not her. She has done her job in feeding you and hopefully you had a father to raise you. I know you love her, but she will always keep you down.

* *I was abused as a child.* **Don’t Care. It’s Your Fault.**

This is a hard truth for some people to swallow. But here’s the secret, it has nothing to do with accepting or assigning blame. Blame is for losers. Blame is used to shirk and skip out on responsibility. Blame is a tool for blue pill faggots.

**Responsibility is a tool for winners.**

---

Let’s take a look at a real life scenario that could happen to any one of us.

You are walking down the street one evening in your city's downtown area on the way to a date. Since you are in a time crunch you cut down an alleyway to save a few minutes. As you are walking you get an uneasy feeling in your gut. You can’t place it, but something feels off.

Moving past a dumpster you see movement out of your peripheral vision and before you can identify it, the words, “*Give me your wallet, phone and watch,*”  register in your ears. While instinctively turning towards the sound you feel a sharp pain in your side and when looking down see the knife blade being pulled from your gut. Falling to the ground you think to yourself, “How did this happen?”

Rule #1 says, “It’s your fault.”

---

*But I didn’t stab myself. I was just walking downtown. It’s a safe city. It was just bad luck.*

Sure, that is one way to look at it. Bad luck. But I don’t believe in luck. I believe we, through our intentional and unintentional actions, influence the world around us. We are the masters of our own destiny. By simply writing things off as bad luck or circumstance or **victim mentality** we are absolving ourselves of the **responsibility** to live our own lives.

In the above scenario are you an actual victim of a crime? Absolutely. Is the criminal to blame for your wounds? Of course. But who holds the responsibility for your life and the choices you made to put yourself there? Only you.

Did you have to be late and therefore choose to walk that way to save time? **No**. Could you have been more situationally aware and listen to your intuition? **Yes**. Even barring those was there a more advantageous outcome once engaged by the thief? **Of course**.

Let’s say you were Concealed Carrying (assuming it’s legal in your jurisdiction) and had enough situational awareness to notice the attacker before they were close enough to stab you. They still demand your money and with a knife in hand start to move towards you. You draw and shoot them.

Rule #1 It’s your fault.

(Disclaimer: This is a good scenario because it shows an important distinction between taking personal responsibility for your life, and legal or some other liability for your actions. I don’t ever want this rule to be construed as advice to take liability. It’s just about accepting the fact you are not a victim. It’s your fault. Own it personally, but in the above scenario shut up and ask for a lawyer.)

---

Why is it so important to take personal responsibility for your life?

If you spend your time trying to find and place blame, rather than just saying, “It’s my fault.” You will never be able to spend your time finding solutions and improving. If you write off the scenario above as bad luck, then you don’t learn how to avoid the situation to begin with.

When your girl cheats on you and you say, “It’s her fault for doing that.” You are technically correct and you should 1000% hold her responsible for her behaviour. But what did you do that led up to that. Things do not occur in a vacuum. Maybe you can evaluate the situation and come to the conclusion that you had no hand in anything leading up to it. But most likely not.

The other important reason for taking responsibility in your life is your own happiness.

When I get mad at people for things they do, I allow them to influence my happiness. If I look at every situation in life and ask, “How is this my fault?” I have much more control over outcomes and emotions about the situation. My happiness is no longer defined by others actions. I won’t be angry or upset about things that happen to me because I’m learning to own **my** life and **my** feelings.

Stop giving other people and life events power over your happiness and life. Take responsibility. Own your own life.

**Rule #1: It’s your fault.**

One key to under standing the world is that *there are no small lies*, minor shifts in approximation or slight exaggerations- no, when lies are told, they are big lies- whoppers, total bullshit, the wool being pulled over your eyes- and **lies are usually the polar opposite of the truth.**

Take what we're told about FEMALE NATURE. We're told that women are naturally sweet, nurturing, understanding; trusting, humble, and submissive- all aspects of [femininity](http://archive.vn/gGQLH) that we're told *come naturally to women as FEMALE NATURE.*

This, my friends and brothers, is a lie- and the polar opposite is true.

Rolling things back to humans as *fancy animals.* Women are dick targets and baby ovens. Men are cum machines and lion killers. Everything on top of this are theatrics for one to attract the other. Anything on top of that are exceptional people doing exceptional things- but on the red pill, we don't concern ourselves with *exceptions to the rule.*

**The rule is that we are animals and we want to fuck...**

...in order to procreate, at least that's where the urge really comes from. And, again, men want the LARGEST NUMBER of women to (theoretically) inseminate and women want to select the BEST MEN to be (again, theoretically) inseminated by...

**Female nature is her quest to find the best men, with the best genetics, to have sex with.** We call this hypergamy, or the female instinct to *trade up*, always on the hunt to find a better mate and produce higher quality children (the latter, of course, is subconscious).

What is the problem here? Allowing this to run rampant, without restriction, will not produce strong societies or coherent civilizations. In other words, you're here, reading this on a smart phone, because of the limits put on human nature/female sexuality (again, dominant men looking to impregnate everything that moves and hypergamous women looking to abandon her prior husband and offspring in the face of a more dominant man)- we call these limits *marriage.*

Suddenly with the bond of marriage (either through the church or through the state, or both)- enforced by a strong social taboo against promiscuity and adultery- women were stuck with the man she chose at a young age, and cads (or, in modern terms, CHADS) had their dicks on a leash. If they wanted to make their marriage a happy and content one, that opportunity was available for them to take. For all the talk about having to do away with the rigid, TILL DEATH, institution of marriage, as it produced *unhappy people*, it was their own fault for not making the most of what they were given rather than faulting the glue we used to hold society together.

But, as it turns out- and as we're seeing now, with aging cat ladies and divorcees loading up on anti-depressants- marriage was actually the best arrangement for long term happiness. And, in order to get both men and women to subdue their inner nature, there needed to be a little bit of *brain trickery*, in the form of social programming and taboos.

**Femininity was a form of social programming.** Convince women to be trusting in her husband, humble in the face of his confidence and masculinity (as leader and head-of-household), and submissive to his leadership. These character traits that she was programmed with, and pressured to adhere to, necessitated that she make a good, long-term choice (a man who is emotionally stable, kind, dependable, etc.) as she would be punished by a poor long term choice. On the flipside, this encouraged men to be good men in order to attract good women, and have a *good marriage.* Everyone was putting their best food forward, or they didn't win the game.

Of course, to the surprise of no one, when feminism became the dominant ideology, they did away with any expectations fostered on women, creating circumstances for hypergamy to run wild, and for marriage (as we knew it) to die, dead as fucking dead. And, guess what bucko, all those social expectations are still placed on men- at least superficially- and **the real heart of our message on THE RED PILL is: the game ended a long time ago, so stop playing by fucking the rules.**

1.) You read literature and it tells you to improve in certain areas of your life. You do what the literature says.

2.) The self improvement isn’t working nearly as fast as you’d like, so you complain. At this point people either stagnate and never pass this stage or continue to improve themselves regardless.

3.) Women begin showing attraction towards you. It appears the self improvement is working. Plus, you feel much happier then before.

4.) You slack on the improvement, now believing that you are good enough for any woman of your desires. Even though you continue to get laid you become less and less happy. As you become less happy you start getting laid less. At this point another crossroads presents itself. Either you backtrack to step 2 or ascend to step 5.

5.) You realize women were not the source of ur happiness in step 3. It was your self improvement. The women came because you were happy and improving. For many, they re-invigorate themselves and focus on self improvement again and become happy. For some, the happiness does not return.

Optional 6.) If you find yourself improving but remaining sad it is likely that the improvement you have laid out for yourself isn’t what you actually want to improve at. It is those that require a step 6 this post focuses on.

When I was in 8th grade, I was very happy. Why? I had improved from bronze 5 to platinum 5 in league of legends during the year. The happiness did not result from the actual achievement, but rather the journey of improvement. People experience happiness in the 3rd stage not just because they are improving at weight lifting and game, but because they are improving with women. Remember people often come to this sub for the sole reason of improving with women. This is what they wanted to improve and they are seeing the incremental improvement. 

The problem of stage 4 arises because getting women is not a goal that can provide incremental improvement for a long time. After a point, continuing to improve at the majority of goals given on this sub stop improving your ability to get women. For most of those that ascend to step 5, ascend because the goals given on this sub for instance, social confidence and fitness, become what they wish to improve at. 

The majority that fail to ascend, fail because they simply don’t enjoy those goals as much. Therefore, they miss the lesson of self improvement because they get less satisfaction from the basic goals given to teach this lesson. There are a few that ascend to 5, come to realize they don’t enjoy lifting and constant social confidence improvement as much as other avenues. These people continue on to step 6, discover what they love to improve at and understand that happiness does not come from a set of instructions given to you, but rather happiness comes from pursuing improvement in what you want. This could be a video game, ceramics, or raising kids. 

Don’t get me wrong, fitness and social ability are extremely important to well being, and I am not saying people should not keep the habit of lifting or socializing. Instead, I am saying don’t expect powerlifting or social mastery to be every persons key to happiness. Also, more importantly, that as long as your are healthy and have friends it doesn’t matter what you focus on improving. All that matters, is that you want to improve in those areas.",822,2,0.5202000141143799,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck",3

Here we are.

&#x200B;

**Why should you improve your looks?**

If you truly think that looks do not matter you are truly delusional and the circle jerk of ""Red Pill"" nowadays has gotten to your head, I am sorry to all TRP funs but I've been here long enough to realize that the circle jerk and YouTubers filling this sub with recycled content is beyond control. 

Yes, looks do matter and it's something that everyone in the Red Pill community should try to improve if you don't try to improve your looks you are not someone who *lives* the Red Pill lifestyle in my books.

Plus this is evidence-backed, do your own research.

# Haircut & Facial Hair

**Balding** ***-*** If you are **CURRENTLY** balding (receding hairline), buy a derma roller (along with minoxidil) as your first line of defense and use some DHT blockers(this needs more research on your part). [https://moreplatesmoredates.com](https://moreplatesmoredates.com/) blog and YouTube channel has some of the best content on the subject.

&#x200B;

**Bald -** If you are already bald there are three things you can do. Embrace it and go on from there, but yes being bald will ""decrease your SMV"" but there are plenty chicks out there that will be more than willing to rub their pussy in your shiny head or get a Toupée. The best solution would be to do a hair transplant, costly but probably your best option for natural-looking hair.

&#x200B;

**Haircut -** Your haircut plays a major factor on how good you look. The best styles are the ones that fit your face shape the best. There are \~6 of face shapes: Oval, round, square, heart, rectangle (aka oblong), and diamond.

&#x200B;

>***Oval*** Face is longer than it is wide, with the jaw being a bit more narrow than the forehead. The jaw is slightly narrower than the forehead and tapers down towards the chin. Lines are fairly soft.  
>  
>***Round*** Babyface basically. Like oval but with vertical and horizontal ratios being almost identical.  
>  
>***Square*** Like a round face but with hard edges. Prominent jawline and compact midface.  
>  
>***Heart*** Prominent forehead tapering down into narrow or pointed chin.  
>  
>***Rectangle*** like oval but with sharper lines. leads to typical horse face appearance.  
>  
>***Diamond*** like oval but cheekbones are the widest part. narrow forehead and chin area with angular bone structure. Usually somewhat large gonial angle and high hyoid bone.

&#x200B;

After you have identified your face shape what cut should you get for it?

>**OVAL:**  
>  
>Very versatile. One of the most “flexible” face shapes feel free to experiment tend to look better with short styles.  
>  
>*Caution:* Stay away from too much height/volume on top.  
>  
>**ROUND:**  
>  
>Keep hair short on sides and back, long on top. Volume/height products are your best friend, try and grow facial hair.  
>  
>**SQUARE:**  
>  
>Hair should aim to soften the harsh lines of the upper face. Messy, medium length hair is the best bet. This is the best type of shape to pull off a buzzcut, use facial hair to soften harsh jaw angle  
>  
>**HEART:**  
>  
>Stay the fuck away from short hair, use long or medium length up top swept over to mask large forehead. Use facial hair to fill out jaw  
>  
>**RECTANGLE:**  
>  
>Stay away from short sides or cuts that give volume up top, don’t grow a beard.  
>  
>You can probably pull off slicked back hair.  
>  
>**DIAMOND:**  
>  
>Go with a fringe, long on top covering some of the forehead.  
>  
>You can grow facial hair or not, up to you.

If you are still not sure Instagram models, Tumblr, fashion blogs and Pinterest are your friends.

DO NOT cheap out and go on a shitty barber, most of them have no idea how to style and cut hair for specific face shape. Go to a professional and when the cut is done take some pics that you can so to your barber for reference and hopefully he doesn't fuck it up.

&#x200B;

**Beard -** Watch [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLLaHc22qAU) video, If you can't grow a beard and it makes you look like a Shaggy from Scooby-Doo knock off, then cut that shit. 

&#x200B;

# Skin

**Acne -** If your acne is hormonal then you have to let do its work, you can hop over the skincareaddiction subreddit and other skincare subreddits for advice on how to handle the situation and improve it. If you are not in your teens that means that there is something wrong with you, thus you have acne. This probably is your diet (which will discuss later on) or other issues, once again skincareaddiction subreddit is your friend, but make sure to check with your doctor.

&#x200B;

**Skin Texture -** I am using Tretinoin for this, however, this can also fuck up your skin so do your own research. Skincare subs are your holy grail for this.

&#x200B;

**Tan -** Tanning can greatly improve someone's appearance, please do not use those tanning creams that at the end make you look like some Manchester Girl.

You should aim for a Medium Brown color [here is a reference image on tanning levels.](https://1luicn4uholwsc2jlmo5w1ad-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/evoderma-fitzpatrick-skin-tone-scale-SM.png) 

How should you tan? Other than sprays and creams which are temporary and can make you look like the annoying orange, I suggest you go to a Tanning bed or even better a Beach.

If you can't tan for shit or in general want to tan faster lookup ""Melanotan 2"" and read up on it, the Peptides sub might come in a handful (be careful with this, this stuff ain't something to mess around with and the boners from it are no joke).

&#x200B;

# Diet and Fitness

**Diet -** Diet is a controversial subject, no, it's not that I am scared that vegan soy boys will come after me but simply that you have to see how you react to specific food and act accordingly, I cannot tolerate carbs thus I went with SCD (Specific Carbohydrate Diet from the book ""Breaking the Vicious Cycle"" the book is worth a read especially if you suffer from Crohn's/IBD, etc).

In my opinion, start with a Ray Peat inspired diet such as [Thermo30](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1153/7200/files/Thermo30_Fat_Loss.png?v=1524509549) or this one.

&#x200B;

**Fitness -** Lift weights(make sure to have correct form otherwise you are stupid), do HIIT  and use the Buteyko method. Maybe some calisthenics for showing off. 

You should aim to stay at around 12% BodyFat since that is where most people look the best.

Jeff Nippard, Jeff Cavaliere, MorePlatesMoreDates and my personal favourite John Meadows are your friends. Don't fall for traps like ""6 minute abs"" bullshit.

**DO NOT, buy workout programs,** without trying them first.

Try out a program and then buy it from the creator, people may disagree with me on this but this is safer than falling for shitty workout programs.

Before I get into the details of why joining a fraternity can positively impact your social life and your game with girls, I want to talk a little bit about my past. 

High school was hell for me. It was the worst experience of my life. I didn’t really have friends despite desperately wanting to be popular. The friends that I did have were also kind of losers like me. Great guys, but we never really had the fun that the popular guys had.  I never went to parties. I never even had kissed at girl in high school. This partly had to do with the way I was raised. 

I decided to go to a college that was several hours away from home. First year was okay. I made some friends, went to some parties… But there was something missing. 

I struggled making “real” friends and having a group to belong to. The parties and social events that I did go to were never truly organized. They sort of just happened. I made some friends, but I did not have an abundance of friends. 

This year, everything changed. A couple guys from one of my classes were part of a frat. At the time, I didn’t really know much about what a frat was. Like everyone else, I had all these negative connotations associated with the word. “All they do is drink and party”. “You have to pay to have friends, how stupid is that”. 

Turns out, I couldn’t be more wrong. I remembered that a few guys on this subreddit had talked about the benefits of a frat. So, I decided to express some interest early in the process. 

The two guys from my class took a liking of me. They invited me to a couple invents so that I could meet the rest of the guys. I thought it was a great group of guys and they liked me too. 

I met some of the other potential pledges (people thinking about joining), and I liked them too. I convinced a couple friends of mine to join with me, and they did. My social life, and my game have greatly improved as a result. Without further ado, here are the 3 reasons why you should join a frat if you’re in college: 

**1) Abundance.** 

As I talked about, I now have an abundance of parties and social events that I can go to. I have a fee that I pay every semester, but that’s about it. Almost all these events are optional. It’s a great way to go out and have fun. Also, you’re no longer the guy who’s actively searching for fun stuff to do. Instead, you’re the guy in control. You get to invite people and throw parties. I no longer feel desperate for friends or for fun. I have an abundance of it. With this, comes a very attractive and calm attitude. Furthermore, the friendships that I made feel real to me.

**2) Networking, Career and Philanthropy.**  

A frat isn’t just about the parties. Most of the guys in my frat are in my program. Some are older than me and have access to notes and textbooks that they can lend me. Some have great advice on what courses to take, how to manage money…The frat that I now belong to, is a big one in North America. Some very successful people have been a part of it throughout the years. This can be very helpful for your career. We also have a ton of philanthropy events. We get to go out and help the community and just be good human beings. 

**3) Girls.** 

Now that I’m in a frat, it’s much easier to meet girls. One way is through the parties and social events that we have every week. But we also have relations with sororities and events with them. Joining a frat is like social circle game to the max, at least from my experience. A lot of the frat guys have a lot of friends who are girls, so you’re bound to meet them at some point. Then you’re circle just keeps getting bigger and bigger. With that, your confidence increases. 

In conclusion, a frat can help you with just about everything when you’re in college. With girls, with having an abundance of options when it comes to events and parties, with school grades, with networking, with career options, and even with philanthropy and building yourself as a man. 

Overall, it’s been a great experience for me. I don’t think it’s for everyone. But if you are anything like who I was, someone who was really struggling socially and needed a group to belong to. Someone who quite honestly didn’t really have the balls for cold approach. Someone who often found himself in isolation. Someone who was hungry for success in other areas of life, such as business, but who couldn’t quite concentrate because his social needs weren’t being met. If you are anything like I used to be, then consider joining a frat. 

The most important thing is to meet the people that a part of it. Make sure you vibe with them. Make sure that you can see these people as your friends, most importantly the other people thinking of joining (since you’ll be spending most of your time with them at first). Maybe try to get a couple of your friends involved with you, if you have friends. Of course, make sure that you have the means to be paying their fee every semester.

Winehouse may have rolled her eyes, but the fact of the matter remains: **sex is the narrative of attraction**. For the red-hot 20 minutes I spent with Amy, she behaved like the ideal submissive- this is what she wanted in the moment. After, when her big girl brain came back, the feminist became disgusted with herself, and, “get this shit off me,” was her way of re-framing the mess she’d made by bending to my will.

**Sex is like editing together a documentary film. Everything is based in reality, but it’s up to you to put together the story. Initial attraction may be there, but if you don’t string things together the right way, you’re not getting laid.**

Both sexes have their role in building this narrative. It’s too easy to reduce the female’s role to that of a movie goer or theater attendee; “just start the damn show and hope I don’t walk out.” Although there is truth to that dynamic, the woman has her part in showing up *fit for the performance*.

If she’s had the bad luck of being out with a doofus, only minimal effort is required. The slightest exertion of feminine prowess will allow her total control of the situation. These aesthetic stakes will rise along-side the value of the man interested. By the time she shows up to the date, he’ll already know if he wants to fuck her or not- from there, as long as she doesn’t commit an egregious, narrative disrupting crime of anti-sexuality, her job is mostly done- any further action on her part is for sport.

As a man falls under the aesthetic spell of a woman, he’ll construct the rest of the narrative on his own with very little input from her. Did she try to make a joke? It’s hysterical! Did she make a rather obvious observation? She’s so smart! Is there any kind of minor nuance to her behavior that can be focused on and doted over? She’s adorable!

His misguided interpretation of her qualities will remain until his attraction for her has been extinguished, which may be accompanied by feelings of sadness, guilt, shame, or even disgust, depending on the particulars of the situation.

Since anything beyond her aesthetic may be his narrative imposing on reality, there isn’t a lingering question of authenticity. Ironically, the authenticity of her beauty is actually debatable- women have an entire arsenal of weapons to deceive the gullible- however, most men are only looking for surface level approval.

Conversely, **authenticity is a central question for her- an on-going issue to which her attraction to him is contingent upon.**

She will also see what she wants and lie to herself, but rather than constructing a false narrative based on his aesthetic, she magnifies the fragments of his personality that she finds attractive and comes to the conclusion that he “must always be like that.”

This is as much a naive fantasy as his personifying her beauty into the idealized girlfriend. While he’s putting his best foot forward on their date in an attempt to have a sex worthy performance, she’s going along for the ride believing that he’s being himself and this decisive, assertive, cool and confident guy is *just who he is*.

Only it isn’t so easy- women are savvier in this department than men. **She’ll subconsciously match his behavior to what he looks like while trying to determine if he should be entitled to acting so decisive, assertive, cool and confident. And if this scan turns up negative, she’ll think he’s faking his swagger and aggressively test the depth of his authenticity.**

If he’s able to hold this frame together for long enough, he’ll get laid.

**All human relationships contain a degree of narrative, requiring effort and social pruning, because we’re really just animals on a dirty rock floating in space.** But, yes, we have the capacity of forming intimate relationships with one another, and that can be a great experience… or a devastatingly disappointing experience… or something so torturous that it becomes mentally crippling. Even the bonds of family are held together by narrative- and if this seems inaccurate to you, you likely don’t know the pain of a distant mother or an absent father… or, even a murderous mother.

**There is no greater emotional pain than of a narrative dissolving.** Death, of course, is the ultimate narrative dissolution… but short of an ending so dramatic, there is an element of innocence lost for good when a relationship falls into disrepair. When you can take a step back and recognize the true peak, the trust and good feelings that went with it, and even if you’re not conscious of the narrative elements that engendered the connection, you’re highly aware of your new status as strangers.

If we can crystallize heartbreak to a single moment, it would be the intersection between confidant and stranger.

The Red Pill is a community of lab coat wearing scientists who analyse 100% true unbiased field reports in order to unlock the secrets of quantum ""All Women Are Whores.""

As rational empirical alpha male sex scientists the logical way to begin our research is by measuring our penises. This however presents the issue of replicability and the need for a Uniform Penis Measurement Standard (UPMS).  How do we determine where the base of the penis truly begins? Is it where the shaft emerges from the fatty mons tissue? Or do we press the ruler into the pelvis to obtain a  measurement at the dick stem? How do we account for odd shapes and curves? Akin to an HB scale, we need to an objective amalgamate unit scale that takes all factors into consideration. A True Penis (TP) value of 1- 10 which factors in all elements including testicle size weight and symmetry, scrotum wrinkling, moles rolls factor, pubic hair trimming, as well as aftermarket decorative elements like jeweled cock rings.

In order to obtain a complete scientific understanding of a particular penis, the penis in question must be submitted to the Uniform Penis Measurement Standard (UPMS) and the True Penis (TP) examination protocols. The Uniform Penis Measurement Standard uses the [Archimedes principle](https://youtu.be/lQEUDsn0p80?t=165) to obtain a volumetric measure of a particular penis. In order to conduct this highly scientific clinical measurement a penis is inserted into a large beaker of 37C distilled water which sits on a scale tared to zero grams. Although a true stoic alpha can obviously maintain an erection during even extremely adverse physical conditions, through extensive testing it was found that the variability of a flaccid penis's volume when inserted into room temperature or colder water was unacceptably high, so body temperature water is recommended for this test. The buoyant force of the water acting upon the inserted penis manifests as an apparent change in the scale's reading, which is then transformed into the desired volume measurement by using rho = ~ 0.993 g/cm3 at 37C for water. This measurement should be repeated at least three times, under both fully erect and flaccid penile states. Despite the objective nature of this measurement, an impartial referee or other official governing body must still be present to observe the procedure to ensure that 1) the scale is indeed tared at the start of the measurement 2) only the shaft is inserted into the water and not additional appendages or foreign objects 3) that the penis is, indeed, completely flaccid for the flaccid portion of this measurement 4) the measurement is not compromised by unnecessary movement or splashing. The use of a shrill whistle or other auditory feedback device during the test by the referee is encouraged to ensure compliance with the Uniform Penis Measurement Standard protocol.

While the UPMS is an objective volumetric measure. True Penis (TP) is a holistic multivariate analysis of all genital aesthetic elements assessed at a 1-10 scale. In order to submit a penis for TP assay, a photograph of both erect and flacid forms must be submitted to a certified TP specialist. These Rational Males have dedicated their entire lives to analyzing men's penises. In fact they are so invested in penile assessment that they have little time to invest in physical health, masculinity or serious intellectual endeavors. All these men have time for is assessing and analysing cocks which is why they are exempt from Red Pill's lifting requirements. If you're are interested in undergoing a TP assessment do not hesitate to contact our specialists. They love getting paid to stare at cocks almost as much as they hate lifting and will get back to you promptly with the proper information on how to submit your specimen.

Now that we have an understanding of the protocols and procedures needed to obtain a complete scientific measurement of a particular penis, the next logical step is interpreting the result. You got your numbers back and their not very good. What do you do now? If that's the case simply abandon hardline biological determinism and adopt a liberal subjectivist attitude. Don't be ashamed to revert to determinism at a later date if it suits your egoic fulfilment. TRP is not about what size of dick is best, but how to have the BEST dick no matter what that means to you. It could be no dick at all.

At this point you have two options: self improvement or self delusion, although the two are not mutually exclusive. Jelquing is the art of pulling on your ding ding in a desperate attempt to make it bigger. It's not about the penis you currently have, its about the penis you one day will have. Jelquing requires patience effort and consistency, qualities that are in short supply among redditers. The second option is ""Faking It Till You Make It"". Pretending the issue is resolved is much easier than actually doing anything about it. Buy a dick sleeve. Using a fixadent like product glue your penis into the dick sleeve. Don't worry about the logistical nightmare of having a plastic penis glued onto your real penis. It's not about the reality of your penis, its about her perceived reality of your penis. 

This brings me to the deep philosophical conclusion 80% of the Red Pill will never comprehend. Is penis measuring both in the literal and metaphorical sense a coping mechanism for living in a castrating NeoLiberal society? Man feels castrated by society so he measures his penis in a desperate attempt to affirm that it is still there. Isn't measuring the penis a castrating act unto itself which inevitably leads to a positive feedback loop of more measurement? Furthermore if penile measurement is itself a symptom shouldn't we seek to overcome it rather than endlessly enjoying the symptom? Isn't it true that the more empirical a man is the more castrated, humorless, boring and lifeless he is? Aren'tt impulsivity and spontaneity key traits that make a man attractive? Then why are we striving for the exact opposite in a community dedicated to helping men get laid? Finally since women find humorless scientific empiricists boring and unattractive shouldn't you instead strive to be a fun guy who writes April Fool's day posts?

This is the be all and end all: __why do you fucking care?__

If you’ve been around for TRP a while, you will know what I’m talking about. Endless questions posted by the new and not so new consumers of the pill. They’ve just found this awesome forum on the internet that is 100% guaranteed to turn them into pussy slaying LVL 99 alpha bro dudes overnight - great.

Asktrp has all the answers they need. They read the sidebar (or don’t, more often than not), read a couple GLO posts and get motivated to go try this shit in real life. They go do some curls, call a dude a beta, cold approach a girl or 2 and then run into an error. “Why did this girl take 1 minute longer than usual to reply? I’m red pilled now, how is this happening? Asktrp will know!” So they run and ask the internet alphas for advice. They get called a faggot and told to go lift, get some piece of advice, and then they go back about their business. Then they will keep getting spoon fed every time they run to asktrp for help.

_Before asking a question on asktrp, ask yourself this_: **why do I fucking care?**

Why do girls prefer X over Y? Who cares?

Why does X beta male get girls when he is a faggot due to Y reason? Who cares?

Seen a fat beta male pull an HB9 today, how is that possible?

**Who cares? Why do you fucking care?**

Tonight's discussion takes on The Wall and how it applies to women's pluralistic mating strategy. This episode was shaped towards women, but the research articles below are worth reading and the video is evergreen for the entire Red Pill community.

Not only do they discuss The Wall and how women can navigate it, but for those with kids they give useful tips and pitfalls to consider with raising your daughters as they enter the Sexual Marketplace. 

Key questions that were raised...

* Were our elders on to something by restricting daughters' sexuality when they come of age by screening boys they can intersect with? 
* What role do parents and grandparents play in this process?
* What pitfalls does social media create? 
* How can women navigate the sexual marketplace while avoiding getting alpha widowed or being paralyzed by choice due to the advent of dating apps like Tinder?

**The Wall:** The hallmarks of fertility are largely responsible for what make makes women physically attractive to men. To wit, looks and fertility are effectively one in the same. The further women move away from their peak fertility years (late teens to early 20s) the less physically attractive women become. Mother Nature is not a feminist. 

**Strategic Pluralism:** Women's mating strategy has often been referred to as a dualistic strategy (AF vs BB), but it's more nuanced than that. As discussed in the livestream, there's the AF/BB during women's monthly cycle and then there's a macro level application of this across their lives opting for AF during their youth and then settling for BB once they approach the dreaded wall. Ideally women should strive for guys that have a good blend of both dad *and* cad qualities. The best of both worlds if you will. Guys that get this figured out have options galore as they're the total package, so our advice to the ladies is to not delay if you know early on you want to have a family someday.

I really enjoyed the post about female solipsism, as it's something that can be vividly seen and tracked. So here is a recent story. 

So because of all this quarantine and lockdown, I've been getting texts from some of women that I used to try to spin or the ones I was actively trying to before the virus hit the fan. 

I'm not much of a texter, I suck at reading between the lines, therefore for me, it's a logistics tool. I use it strictly to share important information and set up dates. I don't use social media either. I used to, but it's a waste of time. So when I got the following text, I really didn't know not only what time think, but what to say.

9:40 PM : Please PLEASE do not tell anyone because I do not know how I ended up here I trust you.

I just did cocaine.

What? Okay first of all this chick is wild, this doesn't surprise me. Hot, extroverted, witty. She knows her game. She's hard to get. She normally doesn't share personal information or what she does, besides I don't text things like ""what are you up to"". I've been using the rule of less is more and slowly reeling her in. Her issue? Awful friends/influence/coworkers. Note: Apparently cocaine goes around but she ""would never do such a thing"". 

Here is where this is a great example of solipsism.

She is acting like it happened on its own. It just happened. She is not responsible. Which is utter bullshit. Social perception got her in this position and now it's hitting her that she fucked up and is a bad girl. She always was, she likes her alcohol and pot, and with cocaine being all around her it was bound to happen. But telling women what to do is useless. What they see is what it is, and she saw herself as capable, responsible, good. Wrong. She's nowhere near. 

I soft nexted. Seriously I have 2 dull plates waiting after quarantine, and it sucks cause this woman would not care about quarantine restrictions, but not looking for crazy. Especially when they follow up the texts with:

Idk why I shared with you, I'm sorry, I just need to tell someone, I'm in a bad stage in life, it will never happen again.

Why even apologize? If she never told me I could keep fucking her and not be bothered. But she cares what people prcieve her as. And that's all women care about.

TLDR

Plate texts me she did cocaine and it's not her fault and she isn't responsible. Right. You get the rest. The only reason women will tell you something like this is because they think you're some benevolent God who will forgive them and tell them everything is okay! She's not bad!

Edit:

I'm glad this brought up discussion, as thinking about something is a lot more productive than simply absorbing information.

Edit 2:

I am giving an amnesty to any post that has been posted to date, unless it is an egregious rules violation or a site wide violation.  I cannot promise automod or another mod might yank it.

Also be sure to [visit this note](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/f9cm7n/reddit_admin_are_hellbent_on_killing_off_reddit/) from our chief mod and operator of http://trp.red/
----------------------------

A few weeks ago I posted about the quality of submissions and the sort of things I would summarily remove without comment.  It would appear the message was not received.  So I’m going to try again but with additional detail and perhaps a bit more menacing.  

Before continuing, you should read [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ery372/dear_diary/) if you haven’t already.

##Priorities

**A guiding principle of this sub has always been QUALITY over quantity.**

We don’t need to shit-spew dozens and dozens of posts a day like so many other shitholes on reddit.  You can participate by providing good content.  In return the rest of us give the same to you.  Since there are more of us that you, you should be spending more time listening than talking.

**ECs and founding members are important to us.**

We want them to stick around or at least stop by from time to time.  We value what they have to say.  We value their critiques.  We value their experience.  We do not value your personal life story.  We do not value your justice porn.  We do not value your need TO [SAY SOMETHING](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3d5u6t/first_post_syndrome/).

You should be listen to the ECs and refrain from doing things that would drive them away.  Disagreement is ok, but do so in a mature, professional manner.  Refine your ideas before presenting them.  Simply negating an EC looks like dick waving, not proper discourse.  

##The rules and guidelines

**The rules are not optional.**. READ THEM: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/about/rules/  

These supplement site wide rules.  READ THOSE TOO: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy

NO VIOLENCE.  Period.  Zero tolerance.  This is a site wide rule that I completely agree with.  Don’t even joke about it.

This rule and “Threatens, harasses, or bullies” are the hammers that the reddit admins use to nuke subs.  The difficulty for them has been that we have always banned this sort of behavior.  There will be no brigading.  We do not spill out into any other subs unless explicitly invited.  We keep what we do in our subs and leave everyone else the hell alone about it.  

I have and will work with mods in other subs to root out people that violate this so we can ban them.

**Do not name anyone that is not a public figure.  Do not post pictures of anyone that is not a public figure.**  We don’t care what your girlfriend looks like.  We don’t care about some random bar slag you want us to point and laugh at.  

**Breaking any rule is a bannable offense.**  Not knowing a rule is also a bannable offense.  Deleting your bannable post or comment and then asking us why you were banned is going to get you permanently banned.
  
##Post quality

Obviously this does not strictly apply to comments, but we ask you to at least TRY to say something of value.  One word responses and short zingers just clutter shit up.  Do the latter only if you think it really adds to the point.

**There are post formatting rules.**

Yes, really.  Read them here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3a0135/announcement_new_thread_requirements/. I’m going to start enforcing them again, but not super strictly.  Sometimes a different format works better.  Ask yourself: is your writing so good that your format makes it better?  In most cases, the answer will be NO and I will remove it.

We do allow direct links into manosphere.  We allow links elsewhere IF ACCOMPANIED BY A COMMENT THAT PROVIDES ANALYSIS OF THE LINK.  Don’t be lazy.  A 50 word TL;RD is not analysis.  Tell us what you think about it and what it teaches, not just what it says.

**There are content guidelines and principles.**

Read them here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3d4qb2/on_platitudes_imperatives_and_unsolicited_advice/. https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1u6m3m/the_basics_explained_and_our_direction_for_2014/. https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2xwllf/100000/

If you haven’t read all of this, don’t post.  You aren’t ready.

##Post removal 

I’ll try to be more explicit than last time.  This is the last time I give you lists.  From here on out it is your burden to figure out what is post worthy and what is not.  So here is the list of things that will get removed without comment:

- Pointing and laughing without a learnable point.  Making fun of other people is a waste of time.  Learning how to avoid their predicament is useful.
- Justice porn.  This isn’t a contest and there are no winners and losers.
- Seeking validation.  We are not your mommy.  If you need our opinion to feel better about yourself, you are not ready to post.  Validation seeking is a destructive and gross behavior.  Chicks most certainly hate it.  I hate it too.
- Black pill woe is me shit.  Your life sucks?  Keep it to yourself.
- Black pill woe is you shit.  My life sucks?  That’s my problem.
- Links to other subs that haven’t been scrubbed through an archive service.  A couple popular services are https://www.trp.red/archive.php and http://archive.is.
- Dear diary posts.  Basically you talking about yourself without giving a concrete, learnable point.   “He guyzzz, it really works!” is not a learnable point.
- Autistic ramblings about your life.
- [This sort of shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/cc0vj2/about_cosmomasculinity/).  Does it sound like clickbait?  Is it formatted like clickbait?  Don’t do it.
- Debating or negating.  We don’t give a fuck if you disagree.  If you think you have a better way, then present it as a better way.
- Stuff that belongs on https://www.reddit.com/r/ThankTRP/

The following are danger areas.  There are lots of good posts that do it, but be mindful of the content guidelines and principles.  They are:

- Prescriptive advice.  Tell me a proper way to eat, drink, lift and general life skills can be useful, even if controversial.   Giving us a checklist of how to approach is not.  The former are material acts with specific results.  The latter is how something worked for you, which is worthless to the rest of us.  You’d be better off telling us Why it worked for you.
- Politics.  Der.
- Meta topics.  If you really think there is a hot topic, then ask us first. 
- MGTOW but because of what I will be saying about incels below.
- Short posts unless it’s a razor sharp and novel point.  Good posts usually take time. 

##Ban bait

Aside from violating the rules, the following might get you banned (technically they are rules violations, so consider these examples, rather than additions).  They are:

- Incel content.  I’m so fucking done with it.  No memes.  No egging each other on.  No trying to find your kin.  Zip.  If I sniff an incel, you are gone.  You better be an incel in active recovery.
- [Jordan Peterson](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9gyopm/no_more_jordan_peterson_shit/)
- [This sort of trash](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/emxugb/last_night_i_didnt_have_sex/).  Read the comments, chucklekfucks, if you want to find out what the post really means.  This one is temporarily suspended until Max does his follow up post.

**I’m serious about incel content—-it’s gone.**. The worst fucking thing reddit ever did was shut down braincels, because now the rest of us will suffer it.  We are now joining a large number of other subs that are shutting it down.  

As a clarification, I understand there is a difference between “black pill” and incel.  You can harbor dark opinions while not actually being an incel.  Your opinions will be judged on everything else in this post and not by a possible connection to incel content.  Connect the dots is a game simpleton’s play (aka a whole lot of other subs).

##Closing remarks

**There are no new rules in this post.**  This all flies under what was already acceptable or not acceptable.  

A lot of focus is being put into our other home:  http://trp.red.  If you are looking for more diverse topics, go there.  Find or found a tribe for it.  Here we are going to refine focus on our core principles and purpose, and expect quality in posts.

Feel free to ask questions in comments.  I’ll do what I can as long as I don’t get overwhelmed.

Finally, I hereby grant a general amnesty for any post submitted before this one—as long as it doesn’t break site wide rules.  I also may leave some posts up but locked with a note why it should have been removed.

I discovered TRP five or six years ago now. At that point in my life, I was smart, egotistic, socially awkward, and not particularly (read: not at all) attractive. I'm sure we all have our own treasured memories from high school.  

Over the years I succeeded and failed in applying TRP. A few years back, I met the girl who would become my first LTR ever. TRP ideas helped me predict her behavior, but I also used them to mask my insecurities. Instead of writing a novella with all the boring details, I jump from idea to idea doing my best to avoid TRP cliches.

**BODY**

First things first, my self awareness when she and I met might have put me on the autism spectrum (she used to point out similarities between myself and her friend with aspergers). My looks compensated for it; **weight lifting** contributed to my looks more than any other factor. I cannot overstate how important weight lifting has been in my life the past half a decade or so.

Sex was always the most enjoyable when I treated it as a game. I learned to not go into the bedroom with a script in my head of how things were supposed to go; instead I went with the flow based on how she and I were feeling. Sometimes we fucked dirty, sometimes we made love, other times we just fucked around giggling like kids. Going with the flow always kept it natural; forcing it always felt rigid and unnatural. The only book I've read on the topic is The Sex God Method. I think it's a good place to start developing your own brand of sexuality. 

An LTR will change you. You'll likely become gentler, softer, and more pleasure seeking. Being on the other side now, I can see how my LTR changed me in those ways. It's inevitable, and it's something you should be aware of before shacking up. This change has pros and cons: I lost some of my aggression and ambition, but gained empathy and a certain *joie de vivre*. Now that my relationship is over, I've regained my natural aggression and retained the soft skills I developed with my girl. 

**CONCLUSION**

I'm grateful to have known the amazing girl I dated and for being TRP conscious going in. Before my relationship, I was decently attractive but very rough around the edges. IMO, LTRs are great for refining all aspects of seduction (wit, foreplay, etc.) and social agility. More than anything, I treasure the intimacy I shared with her and the connection we made. All in all, I'm very satisfied with how things turned out and what I learned from the experience.

**Edit**

I left out a lot of details to avoid beating dead horses. The rougher I treated her in bed, the better she treat me. When I fucked her weak she acted out. If I acted like a pussy, she treated me like a pussy. Et cetera, et cetera. You know the rest.",802,2,0.49320000410079956,"time, thing, guy, give, day, post, become, call, http, fuck",3

For all the talk about “girl power” and “women kicking ass” which you see on movies these days, if the men of your “tribe” are too weak or demoralised to protect you, you will be enslaved and crushed by the men from other “tribes” before you can say “Vagina Monologues”. Which means that if you break down men’s masculinity, their willingness and ability to defend themselves and their families, you destroy the country. That’s exactly what Western women have done for the last forty years. ….

The male protective instinct doesn’t take action because Scandinavian women have worked tirelessly to eradicate it, together with everything else that smacks of traditional masculinity. Because of this feminism has greatly weakened  Western civilisation as whole. …

Didn’t feminists always claim that the world would be a better place with women in the driver’s seat, because they wouldn’t sacrifice their own children? Well, isn’t that exactly what they are doing now? 

Misandry, the hatred of men, isn’t necessarily less prevalent than misogyny, the hatred of women. The difference is that the former is much more socially acceptable.

If all oppression comes from Western men, it becomes logical to try weakening them as much as possible. If you do, a paradise of peace and equality awaits us at the other side of the rainbow. Well congratulations to Western women. You’ve succeeded in harassing and ridiculing your own sons into suppressing many of their masculine instincts. To your surprise, you didn’t enter a feminist Nirvana, but paved the way for an unfolding hell. ….

Feminists claim that the reason why women haven’t been as numerous in politics and science as men is due to male oppression of women. Some of this is true. But it is not the whole story. Being male means having to prove something, to achieve something, in a greater way than it does for women. In addition to this, the responsibility for child rearing will always fall more heavily on women than on men. ….

it was in fact the women who started this whole “single is best” culture that now permeates much of the West. Since women initiate most divorces and a divorce can potentially mean financial ruin for a man, it shouldn’t really be too surprising that many men hesitate to get involved at all. … At the same time, women during the past few decades have made it a lot easier to have a girlfriend without getting married. So women make it riskier to get married and easier to stay unmarried, and then they wonder why men “won’t commit?” Maybe too many women didn’t think all this feminism stuff quite through before jumping on the bandwagon? …..

The elaborate welfare state model in the West is frequently labelled as “the nanny state,” but perhaps it could also be named “the husband state.” Why? Well, in a traditional society, the role of men and husbands is to physically protect and financially provide for their women. In our modern society, part of this task has simply been “outsourced” to the state, which helps explain why women in general give a disproportionate support to high taxation and pro-welfare state parties. The state has simply become a substitute husband, upheld by taxation of their ex-husbands. ….

Radical feminism has bred suspicion and hostility, not cooperation. And what’s more, it has no in any way eradicated the basic sexual attraction between feminine women and masculine men. If people do not find this in their own country, they travel to another country or culture to find it, which in our age of globalisation is easier than ever. A striking number of Western men find their wives in East Asia, Latin America or other nations with a more traditional view of femininity, and a number of women find partners from more conservative countries. …

radical feminism has been one of the most important causes of the current weakness of Western civilisation, both culturally and demographically. Feminists, often with a Marxist world view, have been a crucial component in establishing the suffocating public censorship of Political Correctness in Western nations. They have also severely weakened the Western family structure, and contributed to making the West too soft and self-loathing …

Well, after two generations of Second Wave Feminism, Ms. Willis and Ms. Beauvoir have had their way: The West has skyrocketing divorce rates and plummeting birth rates, leading to a cultural and demographic vacuum. And feminists still aren’t satisfied. ….

Feminists claim that women have been victims of men, that men have oppressed women for centuries and that the sexes are equal. Denying this will result in the smears “misogynist” and “male chauvinist pig”. But equalising the sexes has led to a crippling feminisation of Western society … portraying women as oppressed victims and the equals of males is one example of how the pursuit of equality is being used to destroy our society and undermine – and therefore be in conflict with – Mother nature. ….

Basically, in a conversation regarding drunk people fucking, and men being de facto ""rapists"", a feminist questioned why any man would be willing to have sex with any woman who said anything other than ""YES YES PLEASE!"", and insinuated that she was shocked that so many men would admit that they're basically rapists.

I'm not linking to it, lest I be accused of inviting in a ""downvote brigade"".

You like chocolate, right?  Of course you do, everyone does.  If someone offered you some chocolate, you would eat it, right?  Would you only eat it if that person were manic and virtually shoving the chocolate in your face as they screamed ""EAT EAT PLEASE!!!""?  What if they opened up the box of chocolate, and only reluctantly offered it to you?  Would you turn it down?  What if you asked for the chocolate, and they just opened the box, and motioned for you to take some, but didn't seem to give a fuck?  Would you refuse that chocolate because they weren't ridiculously enthusiastic about you eating some?  What if you met them at a bar, and the two of you were drinking, but they were REALLY enthusiastic about it all?

Now, imagine your desire for that chocolate is MUCH stronger.  In fact, it's foundational to nearly everything about you...and your gender.  Imagine simply hearing or seeing things somehow *related* to chocolate, can stir up a hunger within you equivalent to the hunger of a starving person who hasn't eaten a real meal in years.  Of course, as you mature, your desire for chocolate gets more subdued and nuanced, but when you're younger, especially when you just start eating chocolate, the desire for chocolate can be pretty extreme, and can undermine your judgment.

Add to that a society which has all sorts of rules, regulations, and social conventions surrounding how chocolate should be eaten and procured.  Most of them make sense to you...don't accept chocolate from a kid, don't steal it from people, don't coerce people into ""giving"" you chocolate against their will.  But some of them are asinine: you shouldn't eat chocolate with socks on, you shouldn't directly ask for chocolate, men shouldn't share chocolate, etc.  More than that, now you have some people called chocolatists who want even stricter rules.  They tell you that you're basically a criminal who should be locked up because you would accept chocolate from someone who offered it to you when you were both drunk.  They insinuate that you're responsible for the other person's actions AND your own, but that they're not responsible for any actions whatsoever.  They claim it has to do with someone being drunk and being incapable of giving consent to chocolate-sharing.  But in the hypothetical situation, you're both drunk...and they're only blaming you.  When you point out that you disagree, they start insisting that, because you say you *would* accept chocolate even if the person wasn't jumping around like an idiot trying to shove it in your face, you're a horrible person, on par with those who steal someone's chocolate when they're passed out...or those who beat people up to take their chocolate, etc.

A long time ago, some religious people passed laws making it illegal for people to buy chocolate.  Most reasonable people now seem to agree that two consenting adults should be able to sell and buy chocolate from one another...but many of the chocolatists do not.  In fact, they equate buying chocolate with kidnapping people, abusing them, and forcing them to sell chocolate for you under threat of death.  They ignore all the people who currently sell chocolate (illegally) without being coerced, etc.  Aside from that, some chocolatists actually try to outlaw DEPICTIONS of chocolate.  They claim it's also on par with forcing people to sell chocolate against their will, etc.  More than that, many chocolatists also fight for crazy laws...laws which throw out the presumption of innocence (the bedrock of our entire legal system) when chocolate-theft is alleged.  

The thing is, in this world, only gender-A has a natural source of chocolate...gender-B must procure it from gender-A.  So when they fight for some of these crazy laws, they actually fight for legislative gender-inequality.   You look into a lot of their literature...and see much of it holds up gender-A as being inherently superior, but also perpetually victimized, and it holds up gender-B as being inherently inferior, but also perpetually victimizing.  It looks sexist to you...so you call it sexism.  But they have an answer to that.  Instead of denying the idea that they're bigoted against gender-B, they point you to a special definition of ""[sexism](https://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/category/gender/sexism/)"" they're written, which claims it's impossible for gender-A to be sexist against gender-B, but not the other way around...that's right, their definition of sexism is, itself, sexist.

So you facepalm and walk away...unsure of how people could be THIS far off base.  The most fucked up thing of all?  Chocolatism has been embraced, at least superficially, by the mainstream.

I started dating this girl in my senior year of University. Things hit off quickly. We spent almost every night together, and fell in love. After graduating, we both landed great jobs in the same town, and moved in together. I honestly can't describe how great things were. We had no debt, good savings, great jobs, and the relationship couldn't have been better. I knew she was the girl I wanted to marry less than a year after we started dating. My parents, who were divorced, were very outspoken about not rushing into marriage, which is why I hadn't yet proposed 3 years in.

This girl was my perfect match. We knew each other inside out, and would never get sick of one another. I would have done anything for this girl. We had tons of fun, lots of friends, and lots of money. Life was good.

If there is one area I wouldn't have described as perfect, it was our sex life. Don't get me wrong, we had great sex, but finishing was often disappointing for at least one of us. This was the problem (gets a little descriptive):

Whenever I would ""finish"" first, she would become upset and slightly frustrated. Most of us probably know the feeling of getting really close and not being able to get there, so I never really blamed her for that. Usually when this happened, she would become very self-pittying for about an hour, and we'd go to sleep on opposite sides of the bed. It's like she was deliberately trying to make me feel bad for not making sure she was taken care of. It's probably worth mentioning I'd usually offer to go down and finish her off, but that rarely had any effect. Anyways, this wouls usually last about an hour, she would calm down, and everything was always fine. 

Now, here's the flip side of the coin. Most nights I was actually able to make her come. After this happened, I'd continue, and I would say about 30% of the time, she would be in pain. i don't know how normal this is or why it happened, but I accepted it. In these instances, I'd have to stop. The difference is that, although I was usually extremely frustrated (and horny), I'd let her know that it was OK. She was usually frustrated with herself when this happened more than anything else, so I tried as best as I could to constrain my frustration and show her that she meant more to me than anything else. We'd cuddle and go to bed. 

This may not sound like a healthy sex life, I don't know, but to me it was a very minor detail in an otherwise amazing relationship. We still had lots of excellent sex, and we were both very happy with the way things were going.

So now to the night it happened. We had just gotten back from a 5 day trip to her parents' place, which meant no sex for those 5 days. When we got back, I was ready to fuck anything that moved (I was 24, and probably at my sexual peak). I had been letting her know since the night before just exactly what I was going to do to her when we got home.

So we got home, things started, and then something happened. She came first, and then started to have that very recognizable painful look on her face. Now in the past I was able to restrain my frustration in these circumstances, but this time I couldn't. I rolled off and over to my side of the bed. She could tell I was frustrated and wanted to talk about it. I obliged, and began to pour out how exactly I felt. The conversation was actually fairly well-spirited, but I was still frustrated. After a little bit, she asked me if I wanted to try and go at it again. Once more, I obliged. A few minutes in and the same thing happened, except this time, she put on clothes, stormed out of the room, and left.

I was completely shocked. I tried calling but got no answer. It was no more than 30 minutes later of constantly trying to reach her that the cops showed up. She'd told them I'd raped her.

I immediately went in to shock. It was the first time in 3 years I felt the girl of my dreams start to slip away. It seemed surreal. I felt helpless. I tried to reason with the cops (it seemed like my only option at the time), but that obviously had no effect. They took me in for questioning. I was later released on bail and moved in with my parents, but of course, with a trial pending.

For the next few months, everything just seemed like it was in a constant downhill spin. A local feminist group got hold of my girlfriend's story and came to her ""support"", although it seemed their main goal was to make my life a living hell. They found out where I worked, and it didn't take them long to make sure I was fired. At every court appearance, sure enough they were there to ridicule and taunt me for what I'd done, even though I maintained my innocence.

I considered suicide a few times. Ever since graduating, I had the perfect life planned. Get married, have kids, live the life.  I couldn't even imagine my life without her in it, or finding someone to replace her. I had no job, and even started to believe some of the things these people were telling me. I was a wreck. I was very fortunate to have a supportive family. They believed me and helped me through it, and that kept me alive.

As for the trial, I told my side of things, and her story was constantly changing, always getting closer and closer to my account, which never changed. Eventually, her story had changed so much that the judge no longer considered the event to be rape. I was acquitted, and life moved on. The feminist group was not pleased. They were convinced I was guilty and that my ex had somehow been ""emotionally manipulated into changing her story"", because apparantly she still had feelings for me. This is beside the fact that she hadn't talked to me since that fateful night. They continued to pester me and be a generally nuissance, but slowly faded away.

So now, 4 years later, I am again in a happy and trusting relationship. The best thing for me has been to realize how silly those feelings of ""I will never find someone to replace her"" were. I actually managed to find a new decent job during the trial, so yes I'm employed. I look back though, and still have no idea how I could have been so wrong or what the hell happened. She still won't talk to me (although admittedly I stopped trying long ago), and I haven't the slightest idea how things went from best to worst. To think I was going to marry this girl...

The thought of jail was too terrifying for me and I decided I was going to meet up with my girlfriend and string her along just long enough to avoid having her press charges.

Yesterday morning though, the police showed up at my apartment and arrested me. My gf told me she would wait until yesterday to give me enough time to decide before she called the cops, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised she screwed me over.

On my way out, I could see the police were talking to my neighbor. I have very thin walls and I'm terrified about what my neighbor might have heard.

I spent the night in jail, the worst nightmare I could ever imagine and the one thing I wanted to avoid more than anything else. I have a (male, thank god) public defender and my parents posted bail.

My mom isn't speaking with me. My dad says he is very disappointed in me. I could barely hold back my rage at them. I tried explaining how my girlfriend tried to IMPREGNATE herself against my will. How I had taken extreme (though justifiable) measures to stop this injustice, but they're so blinded by fucked up gender equality beliefs that they are turning against me, their own son.

Oh, also when I got home today I found an email from a summer job I really wanted saying I didn't get it. Is it related to this? Did my gf tell them I was arrested? I can't prove it, but I'm suspicious as hell.

I feel fucking destroyed reddit. My entire life is ruined by this lunatic and every single fucking person is against me. I'm hopeless for the first time in my life.

I'll never trust another person I date. I'm flushing every condom, I'm only using spermicidal lube. I'm even considering getting a vasectomy. 

I don't care if you believe me or not, I'm ready to accept I'm worthless garbage to society. To everyone who supported me, thank you, it means a lot. To everyone else, keep laughing and destroying me. Everything is so bleak, I just don't care how much you hate me.

zweel,59,zweel,2012-09-15T06:28:45Z,score,0,con,3,MensRights,1181,"I got into an argument recently here on reddit with a user named felltir (perhaps this person was a troll...judging by the name, it's not an outlandish theory) but it got me to thinking about something...Feminists often claim sexual harassment is such a problem for women, and when I say harassment I am not talking about assault or rape (so those statistics which supposedly prove that assault and rape are not correlated with what women wear are a response to a straw man argument which I am not making)...In any case, feminists indeed make this claim and many women do as well.  So we have that.

Now, if you look at any woman in the subway or passing you in the street you will find that women **relative to men** wear clothing which is far more revealing than men do.  Most men wear collared shirts, a pair of gray pants or loose fitting blue jeans and shoes or boots, perhaps a jacket or an overcoat...something simple and anonymous...Women in contrast wear clothing that men would feel utterly ashamed to wear, like booty shorts and skin tight t-shirts with high sleeves (designed to show off even more skin) and women spend far more time concerned with their appearance.  Aside from rock & roll musicians, women seem to be the only ones who wear things like skin tight leather pants and short skirts...Men simply do not do this.

Now, if we put this together we have a situation where something doesn't add up.  If women were truly sexually harassed to a point where this were a major problem for them (relative to men), the market would dictate that we would find the situation to be completely the opposite...Women would be dressing in far more conservative clothing (relative to men), to ward off this truly problematic harassment.

But here we have the complete reverse taking place...We have women claiming sexual harassment is such a major problem and yet we also have women choosing of their own accord to wear far more revealing clothing.

The same is true of feminists who claim women are overly ""objectified"" and that this is problematic for women.  If it truly were problematic for women, why do they select clothing which objectifies their own bodies?

Now...before anyone straw mans me and says I'm saying women should cover up, I challenge you to point to a section of my text where I said that.  I did not say that.  My statement is simply that if sexual harassment were such a problem, relative to men, we would see women more covered up, relative to men.

The only explanation for this is that the benefits of women objectifying themselves and of women revealing skin and wearing skin tight clothing (narcissism, control over men, personal exaltation) outweighs the potential costs (harassment, such as whistling or comments)...

And anyone who thinks harassment has no correlation with how women dress is a completely deluded moron who I will not have any discussion with.  If you are so far out there that you think how a woman dresses doesn't effect her odds of being harassed you are an idiot.  

Now, I truly do believe sexual harassment is a problem for women, but perhaps it's because they are dressing in such a way as to provoke the response.

Enter sex positive feminist and their ""slut walks"", the complaint that it's not a woman's fault that she wears revealing clothing and is harassed, it's the harasser.  See, here we have an instance of feminists throwing gasoline on the flames they themselves are claiming to want to put out.

But isn't this a cryptic straw man?  It's not like preventing women from wearing overly sexual clothing and asking them to take responsibility for their actions is something which society doesn't expect of men.  If I wore booty shorts and went on the subway and I was harassed, it would be obviously because I am wearing such revealing clothing.  If you think about it, these types of slut walks are not an issue of equality...Are they fighting to be able to do something men can do and they can't?  No.  Men don't walk around in booty shorts, free of harassment.

But this is, for the most part, a free market, and it's a reflection of our values. So, if it is true that more women are being harassed than men and it is true that more women specifically choose to appear this way, it follows that whatever cost the sexual harassment has, the benefits outweigh the costs, at least relative to men.

Whatever, these were just some thoughts on my mind.  Anyone else consider this?",1181,4,0.5594000220298767,"woman, man, look, tell, way, never, start, much, talk, first",1
