0,Post-TRP LTR: a balancing act between masculine aggression and vulnerability,96,0,96,fuxcf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fuxcf4/posttrp_ltr_a_balancing_act_between_masculine/,20,1586049135.0,"**INTRO**

I discovered TRP five or six years ago now. At that point in my life, I was smart, egotistic, socially awkward, and not particularly (read: not at all) attractive. I'm sure we all have our own treasured memories from high school.  

Over the years I succeeded and failed in applying TRP. A few years back, I met the girl who would become my first LTR ever. TRP ideas helped me predict her behavior, but I also used them to mask my insecurities. Instead of writing a novella with all the boring details, I jump from idea to idea doing my best to avoid TRP cliches.

**BODY**

First things first, my self awareness when she and I met might have put me on the autism spectrum (she used to point out similarities between myself and her friend with aspergers). My looks compensated for it; **weight lifting** contributed to my looks more than any other factor. I cannot overstate how important weight lifting has been in my life the past half a decade or so.

Sex was always the most enjoyable when I treated it as a game. I learned to not go into the bedroom with a script in my head of how things were supposed to go; instead I went with the flow based on how she and I were feeling. Sometimes we fucked dirty, sometimes we made love, other times we just fucked around giggling like kids. Going with the flow always kept it natural; forcing it always felt rigid and unnatural. The only book I've read on the topic is The Sex God Method. I think it's a good place to start developing your own brand of sexuality. 

An LTR will change you. You'll likely become gentler, softer, and more pleasure seeking. Being on the other side now, I can see how my LTR changed me in those ways. It's inevitable, and it's something you should be aware of before shacking up. This change has pros and cons: I lost some of my aggression and ambition, but gained empathy and a certain *joie de vivre*. Now that my relationship is over, I've regained my natural aggression and retained the soft skills I developed with my girl. 

**CONCLUSION**

I'm grateful to have known the amazing girl I dated and for being TRP conscious going in. Before my relationship, I was decently attractive but very rough around the edges. IMO, LTRs are great for refining all aspects of seduction (wit, foreplay, etc.) and social agility. More than anything, I treasure the intimacy I shared with her and the connection we made. All in all, I'm very satisfied with how things turned out and what I learned from the experience.

**Edit**

I left out a lot of details to avoid beating dead horses. The rougher I treated her in bed, the better she treat me. When I fucked her weak she acted out. If I acted like a pussy, she treated me like a pussy. Et cetera, et cetera. You know the rest.",2020-04-05 01:12:15
1,Rapport Seeking Voice,287,0,287,fu8g4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fu8g4g/rapport_seeking_voice/,66,1585949388.0,"There are 3 types of vocal tonality: **Rapport Seeking**, **Rapport Neutral**, and **Rapport Breaking**.

**I want to talk about Rapport Seeking**:

This is the tone you often hear when people ask a stranger a question. “Excuse me, do you have the time?” It’s disarming. You want to make sure the stranger feels comfortable with you approaching them on the street, so you’re basically raising the pitch of your voice to subtly say “Hey stranger, I am of no harm to you, please don’t be afraid as I approach.”

This is a safe and recommended tone for women to use. In fact, if you’re anything like me and were raised by a single mom, then *you probably don’t even realize that you replicate this tone in social situations*. 

**My mother spoke** to us children in her neutral voice, but the moment the phone rang, she would answer **with her rapport seeking tone**. The same would happen when she spoke to a stranger (the waiter, post office clerk, people at the bus stop, my teachers, etc.). Literally every person she encountered, my mother’s tone would raise and without realizing it, **I grew up doing the same thing**.

**This tone is crippling for a man.** You are conveying that you are lower status. People pick up on the cue and act accordingly. If you don’t believe me, the next time you are having a conversation with someone, male or female, take note of their tone as the conversation progresses. If you are speaking to them in a rapport seeking tone, they will change their tone in response. Your tone is saying, “I am lower status than you, please be kind to me, I am harmless.” They will change their tone to a more rapport breaking (Higher status) tone. This won’t even be a conscious shift. It just happens because people naturally pick up on social cues and nonverbal communications. 

Learning this was unbelievably eye-opening for me. I saw a YouTube video a few years ago about vocal tones (I'm aware the red pill covers this, but that isn't where I originally learned about tonality) and then I began noticing mine when I spoke. Awareness is the first step to change. Then it's time to take responsibility. **I could’ve blamed my mother, but instead,** **I** **grabbed the wheel** and took responsibility for making the change. It was awkward at first because I had to literally correct myself mid-sentence, “Hi!” (Rapport seeking tone) \*ahem\* “Hey, how are you?” (Rapport Neutral)

The first female I tried this on was a cashier I saw multiple times a week. Usually, she didn’t even look up at me during our transaction. However, just simply changing my tone of voice to a Rapport Neutral (and eventually I mixed in some Rapport Breaking), she not only made eye contact with me the entire time, but her voice tone went from Rapport Breaking to Rapport Seeking towards me. Soon, she would greet me as I stood in line, and our small-talk was much more comfortable.

I began applying it to every conversation I had, no matter who I spoke to. Males that I used to feel were kind of dicks towards me either accepted me as their equal, or even flipped the script and began speaking to me in a rapport seeking tone. Even my female boss now speaks to me in a rapport seeking tone (That one was a surprising shift at first).

Check your tone of voice. If you’re seeking rapport from others, bring that pitch down to a neutral place (the tone you speak in when talking to your friends) and even learn when to mix in some rapport breaking tones to raise your status. You will be surprised at how much it changes your life.",2020-04-03 21:29:48

3,How to grow up elegantly?,1,0,1,fuywge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fuywge/how_to_grow_up_elegantly/,3,1586054511.0,"I know it's a basic and simple question, but it has been on my mind for quite a while.

This thought began just an hour ago when a friend left a comment on a certain Instagram post of mine. He's a good buddy, the man who first introduced me to the ways of TRP. His comment lacked gracefulness, and I wished not to interact in conversation with rudeness and unmannerly remarks. I left no reply.

The problem of modern men is not only about the self-defeating competition against himself in fucking women. The problem is also about how they talk without using their brain. Some people express rudeness without even the slightest consideration. Maybe it's a cultural thing, maybe not. Who cares, any socially intelligent man expresses his opinions with poise. In layman's terms, he is not viewed as trash by society.

I'm in my mid-20s and I'm starting to find my own lane, knowing who I really am. Gone was the guy who displays rakish behavior. Gone was the guy who objectifies women. There's a certain place for a man to act that way and that's when he is a boy. I want to be elegant and would act the part growing up.

TRP is a body of knowledge. Since it has originated from the persepective of insecurity and a lack of self-confidence, the ones that 'awaken' learn the truth behind why things are the way they are, but they fail to identify a deeper side of self-development and it is true acceptance of what is, while applying the truth and not altering himself to what he is not.

As Rollo once said, ""personality is not static."" Best to be yourself while applying what you know of the truth. People, and not just women, could intuitively smell from a mile away whether you are being true to yourself or you are just playing a character based on your imagination from the truth.

Confidence is acceptance of what you really are–your strengths, your weaknesses, you are all of them. Embrace them and play them to your advantage.

Guys introduced to the facets of TRP turn to a more materialistic approach of application, while failing to regard to *age well* with it. Like fine wine, it takes years of intensive care to taste its best flavor. Only then can we say that the juice is well worth the squeeze.

Yesterday, some guy posted on this sub about his frustrations from living the TRP life. Despite his 'years of self-education' with the knowledge and truth, he has found no meaning from fucking around with countless women he encountered throughout his journey. TRP is not a cycle of fucking women over and over, nor is it a game of who gets more lays than who, but rather it is a means of getting to know more about the self and how it can be refined further growing up.

I'm turning 27 this year. Most of my buds still act like they are still in college, being reckless and disregarding the perception of what people think of them. Boys will be boys, so the saying goes. But also, boys turn into men and it starts from a shift in mindset.

Sure, priorities change as men grow up. They get married. Get frustrated by their wives. We all know this premise way too much. Of course, it's a shame if you don't realize that we are the ones who should recognize this narrative more than the other guys. The narrative has been the same ever since Eve ate the apple.

What's more important growing up is the *mindset*. At age 30-35, fucking women wouldn't be the main priority, heck it wouldn't even be an issue, because the mindset has changed. Counting the number of lays has its own place in the life of a TRP-ed man... but growing up elegantly is what drives value even further into the sexual market place--sometimes I cringe even mentioning these terms because they all seem to stem from technicality, that it seems so unnatural for a man in the perspective of a woman.

Sure, ok, not giving a fuck what people think is what other people would argue... but I have considered that I do give a fuck about what people think because everything boils down to how much people would like to associate with me. May it be in business, peers, or even as shallow as the women I attract.

I find that a handful of people in the TRP community values the knowledge behind the ideologies to its utmost potential. However, some guys fail to realize that women are not only sexual objects of desire, as a way to compensate for self-improvement and progress, but people also degrade themselves by doing this. And that is not very elegant.

I think elegance is the highest form of value (in all the market places in the economy of human relations) caused by a clean mindset, intention, and discipline.

Don't you guys agree?",2020-04-05 02:41:51
4,Post Quality,34,0,34,fucqlt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fucqlt/post_quality/,6,1585964304.0,"This is a repost, but it would appear we have some new posters that need some guidance.  I am giving an amnesty to any post that has been posted to date, unless it is an egregious rules violation or a site wide violation.  I cannot promise automod or another mod might yank it.

Also be sure to [visit this note](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/f9cm7n/reddit_admin_are_hellbent_on_killing_off_reddit/) from our chief mod and operator of http://trp.red/
----------------------------

A few weeks ago I posted about the quality of submissions and the sort of things I would summarily remove without comment.  It would appear the message was not received.  So I’m going to try again but with additional detail and perhaps a bit more menacing.  

Before continuing, you should read [my previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ery372/dear_diary/) if you haven’t already.

##Priorities

**A guiding principle of this sub has always been QUALITY over quantity.**

We don’t need to shit-spew dozens and dozens of posts a day like so many other shitholes on reddit.  You can participate by providing good content.  In return the rest of us give the same to you.  Since there are more of us that you, you should be spending more time listening than talking.

**ECs and founding members are important to us.**

We want them to stick around or at least stop by from time to time.  We value what they have to say.  We value their critiques.  We value their experience.  We do not value your personal life story.  We do not value your justice porn.  We do not value your need TO [SAY SOMETHING](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3d5u6t/first_post_syndrome/).

You should be listen to the ECs and refrain from doing things that would drive them away.  Disagreement is ok, but do so in a mature, professional manner.  Refine your ideas before presenting them.  Simply negating an EC looks like dick waving, not proper discourse.  

##The rules and guidelines

**The rules are not optional.**. READ THEM: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/about/rules/  

These supplement site wide rules.  READ THOSE TOO: https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy

NO VIOLENCE.  Period.  Zero tolerance.  This is a site wide rule that I completely agree with.  Don’t even joke about it.

This rule and “Threatens, harasses, or bullies” are the hammers that the reddit admins use to nuke subs.  The difficulty for them has been that we have always banned this sort of behavior.  There will be no brigading.  We do not spill out into any other subs unless explicitly invited.  We keep what we do in our subs and leave everyone else the hell alone about it.  

I have and will work with mods in other subs to root out people that violate this so we can ban them.

**Do not name anyone that is not a public figure.  Do not post pictures of anyone that is not a public figure.**  We don’t care what your girlfriend looks like.  We don’t care about some random bar slag you want us to point and laugh at.  

**Breaking any rule is a bannable offense.**  Not knowing a rule is also a bannable offense.  Deleting your bannable post or comment and then asking us why you were banned is going to get you permanently banned.
  
##Post quality

Obviously this does not strictly apply to comments, but we ask you to at least TRY to say something of value.  One word responses and short zingers just clutter shit up.  Do the latter only if you think it really adds to the point.

**There are post formatting rules.**

Yes, really.  Read them here: https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3a0135/announcement_new_thread_requirements/. I’m going to start enforcing them again, but not super strictly.  Sometimes a different format works better.  Ask yourself: is your writing so good that your format makes it better?  In most cases, the answer will be NO and I will remove it.

We do allow direct links into manosphere.  We allow links elsewhere IF ACCOMPANIED BY A COMMENT THAT PROVIDES ANALYSIS OF THE LINK.  Don’t be lazy.  A 50 word TL;RD is not analysis.  Tell us what you think about it and what it teaches, not just what it says.

**There are content guidelines and principles.**

Read them here:  https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/3d4qb2/on_platitudes_imperatives_and_unsolicited_advice/. https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1u6m3m/the_basics_explained_and_our_direction_for_2014/. https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/2xwllf/100000/

If you haven’t read all of this, don’t post.  You aren’t ready.

##Post removal 

I’ll try to be more explicit than last time.  This is the last time I give you lists.  From here on out it is your burden to figure out what is post worthy and what is not.  So here is the list of things that will get removed without comment:

- Pointing and laughing without a learnable point.  Making fun of other people is a waste of time.  Learning how to avoid their predicament is useful.
- Justice porn.  This isn’t a contest and there are no winners and losers.
- Seeking validation.  We are not your mommy.  If you need our opinion to feel better about yourself, you are not ready to post.  Validation seeking is a destructive and gross behavior.  Chicks most certainly hate it.  I hate it too.
- Black pill woe is me shit.  Your life sucks?  Keep it to yourself.
- Black pill woe is you shit.  My life sucks?  That’s my problem.
- Links to other subs that haven’t been scrubbed through an archive service.  A couple popular services are https://www.trp.red/archive.php and http://archive.is.
- Dear diary posts.  Basically you talking about yourself without giving a concrete, learnable point.   “He guyzzz, it really works!” is not a learnable point.
- Autistic ramblings about your life.
- [This sort of shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/cc0vj2/about_cosmomasculinity/).  Does it sound like clickbait?  Is it formatted like clickbait?  Don’t do it.
- Debating or negating.  We don’t give a fuck if you disagree.  If you think you have a better way, then present it as a better way.
- Stuff that belongs on https://www.reddit.com/r/ThankTRP/

The following are danger areas.  There are lots of good posts that do it, but be mindful of the content guidelines and principles.  They are:

- Prescriptive advice.  Tell me a proper way to eat, drink, lift and general life skills can be useful, even if controversial.   Giving us a checklist of how to approach is not.  The former are material acts with specific results.  The latter is how something worked for you, which is worthless to the rest of us.  You’d be better off telling us Why it worked for you.
- Politics.  Der.
- Meta topics.  If you really think there is a hot topic, then ask us first. 
- MGTOW but because of what I will be saying about incels below.
- Short posts unless it’s a razor sharp and novel point.  Good posts usually take time. 

##Ban bait

Aside from violating the rules, the following might get you banned (technically they are rules violations, so consider these examples, rather than additions).  They are:

- Incel content.  I’m so fucking done with it.  No memes.  No egging each other on.  No trying to find your kin.  Zip.  If I sniff an incel, you are gone.  You better be an incel in active recovery.
- [Jordan Peterson](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/9gyopm/no_more_jordan_peterson_shit/)
- [This sort of trash](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/emxugb/last_night_i_didnt_have_sex/).  Read the comments, chucklekfucks, if you want to find out what the post really means.  This one is temporarily suspended until Max does his follow up post.

**I’m serious about incel content—-it’s gone.**. The worst fucking thing reddit ever did was shut down braincels, because now the rest of us will suffer it.  We are now joining a large number of other subs that are shutting it down.  

As a clarification, I understand there is a difference between “black pill” and incel.  You can harbor dark opinions while not actually being an incel.  Your opinions will be judged on everything else in this post and not by a possible connection to incel content.  Connect the dots is a game simpleton’s play (aka a whole lot of other subs).

##Closing remarks

**There are no new rules in this post.**  This all flies under what was already acceptable or not acceptable.  

A lot of focus is being put into our other home:  http://trp.red.  If you are looking for more diverse topics, go there.  Find or found a tribe for it.  Here we are going to refine focus on our core principles and purpose, and expect quality in posts.

Feel free to ask questions in comments.  I’ll do what I can as long as I don’t get overwhelmed.

Finally, I hereby grant a general amnesty for any post submitted before this one—as long as it doesn’t break site wide rules.  I also may leave some posts up but locked with a note why it should have been removed.  These are teaching moments; make use of them.",2020-04-04 01:38:24
5,Female solipsism at its finest. Example,106,0,106,fu5aly,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fu5aly/female_solipsism_at_its_finest_example/,118,1585934885.0,"Edit: ⬆️ Note flair if someone's confused

I really enjoyed the post about female solipsism, as it's something that can be vividly seen and tracked. So here is a recent story. 

So because of all this quarantine and lockdown, I've been getting texts from some of women that I used to try to spin or the ones I was actively trying to before the virus hit the fan. 

I'm not much of a texter, I suck at reading between the lines, therefore for me, it's a logistics tool. I use it strictly to share important information and set up dates. I don't use social media either. I used to, but it's a waste of time. So when I got the following text, I really didn't know not only what time think, but what to say.

9:40 PM : Please PLEASE do not tell anyone because I do not know how I ended up here I trust you.

I just did cocaine.

What? Okay first of all this chick is wild, this doesn't surprise me. Hot, extroverted, witty. She knows her game. She's hard to get. She normally doesn't share personal information or what she does, besides I don't text things like ""what are you up to"". I've been using the rule of less is more and slowly reeling her in. Her issue? Awful friends/influence/coworkers. Note: Apparently cocaine goes around but she ""would never do such a thing"". 

Here is where this is a great example of solipsism.

She is acting like it happened on its own. It just happened. She is not responsible. Which is utter bullshit. Social perception got her in this position and now it's hitting her that she fucked up and is a bad girl. She always was, she likes her alcohol and pot, and with cocaine being all around her it was bound to happen. But telling women what to do is useless. What they see is what it is, and she saw herself as capable, responsible, good. Wrong. She's nowhere near. 

I soft nexted. Seriously I have 2 dull plates waiting after quarantine, and it sucks cause this woman would not care about quarantine restrictions, but not looking for crazy. Especially when they follow up the texts with:

Idk why I shared with you, I'm sorry, I just need to tell someone, I'm in a bad stage in life, it will never happen again.

Why even apologize? If she never told me I could keep fucking her and not be bothered. But she cares what people prcieve her as. And that's all women care about.

TLDR

Plate texts me she did cocaine and it's not her fault and she isn't responsible. Right. You get the rest. The only reason women will tell you something like this is because they think you're some benevolent God who will forgive them and tell them everything is okay! She's not bad!

Edit:

I'm glad this brought up discussion, as thinking about something is a lot more productive than simply absorbing information.

Edit 2: 

So what I've learned is there are way to many coke heads on Reddit! Y'all need some serious medical attention my friends! COVID-19 does like a weak immune system :D",2020-04-03 17:28:05
6,How COVID-19 will break all your plates ... and more,378,0,378,ftmh9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ftmh9i/how_covid19_will_break_all_your_plates_and_more/,143,1585863512.0,"&#x200B;

Disclaimer: This is not a post about how to get girls, there are so many posts on that here in trp or the PUA community or whatever on what you should and should not do (even though it all comes down to how much you try and the experience you have in the end) this post is on how to maintain your plates, the reasons as to why we break them and what it looks like when you get laid consistently.

The problem with texting

I know that during this pandemic there are guys here who feel the need to text their plates or even new girls. Please for the love of god stop texting girls. Girls, you've hooked up with, girls you want to hook up with, it doesn't matter stop texting them. You can never break a plate by not texting her during this pandemic. But if your attention-seeking, validating, orbiting ass keeps texting her it's easy to fuck up. 

This doesn't just go for this pandemic, it's for everyday life as well.

A bad habit for me personally that I had to get rid of is thinking that if a girl isn't constantly texting me she'll never want to fuck again. This couldn't be further from the truth. The closer you get to her only wanting to text you when she wants to fuck, the better. SHE HAS FRIENDS FOR CONVERSATION, SHE HAS BETA ORBITERS FOR VALIDATION, she should only have you when she wants DICK. All of the women that I fuck consistently, or women that my buddies have, usually only text them Friday night, Saturday night, during the holidays, during their breaks from work or late at night, why? Because that's when they wanna fuck. Not at 1 pm on a Monday afternoon during their bi-monthly hair appointment.  I realize this because I've hooked up with girls and I would forget all about them, not text them at all, and a month later they'd hit me up at 2 am talking about ""wyd rn"". They hit me up, not the guy who they've been texting constantly for the past month, not the guy who commented on her Snapchat story, me, the hot guy who is the opposite of needy and doesn't really give a fuck about them. They're times where I've had to reject girls just because of how fucking late they would hit me up. 

Silence is what you should want, I mean fuck, I like it that way, it's peaceful. Just because you're phone isn't blowing up does not mean no girl wants to fuck with you, just calm down and only text when you wanna set up a plan to meet, or if she wants to text you. Don't try to get your snapchat popping or your phone going off by replies from women just because it feels good, you're fucking up, even if it is flirtatious the main thing is -  it is not necessary, and it makes it easier to fuck up.

Here is why you've already failed when you start texting for convo, the only reasons why you would have to in the first place is because: 

1. You didn't leave a good enough impression when you first met so you're tryna make up for it via text - which almost never works, and is so incredibly hard compared to being in-person that it's not worth pursuing. 
2. You're lonely and want the attention of a woman 
3. You haven't even met the girl - which I strongly advise against sliding into the dm's and being grouped with the hundreds (yes hundreds, doesn't matter if the girl is hot or not) of betas who've already tried.
4. You lack an ""abundance mentality""
5. You just want her to know you exist - (lol you pathetic piece of shit, but damn I've been there too)

What does it look like for guys who get laid consistently

Let me break down what getting laid consistently looks like, it's not a lot of effort, in fact, it's almost no effort when it happens, most of the effort comes at the beginning, once you have it though, it's easy to maintain. For starters, do as I said before and stop texting for convo. It's a Saturday night or whatever and you want to get laid, okay great! You've already texted that girl you met in class three days ago who you gamed to the point where she would be down to hang. Oh, you haven't? You haven't even met a new girl this week? Jesus. No worries, text that plate who you know would be down to hang because you know she likes you a lot. She hasn't responded? Text your other plate. She's going to the club with her friends? Text your other plate, wait, you don't have any other plates? You only have TWO girls on your phone who you've hooked up with recently? What the fuck?

Okay, not all hope is lost, you can go to the club with the other plate, or with your friends who like to go out, and you can either get with her there or find some other girl because damn, you're in desperate need for more women in your life. You may not pull today but maybe tomorrow, as you learn and grow from your mistakes. Maybe next week, it takes time, it takes rejection. But you'll get to the point where you have a solid amount of plates. 

As you get more plates and start texting girls only when you want to hang out, the more of a chance you have for a girl to hit you up when she's free, and the more likely you are to find a girl who would be down to hang out. Don't get lazy and try to be fuck buddies instantly with the girl you just met by texting her a lot, it's not how this works. And even if you become successful with fucking this one girl a lot, what happens when she flakes, or when she isn't free? You're jacking it. Texting doesn't get you anywhere. But it all starts with you going out and trying to pull, and doing it consistently.

""Oh great, so basically in order to get laid consistently you have to be getting laid consistently, great fucking advice man"". Thank you, and it fucking is! You can't be getting laid consistently without looking like a man who gets laid consistently, you've read trp you know how this shit works. What do you need to maintain your perceived attractiveness from a girl? 

1. Outcome Independence 
2. Abundance Mentality 
3. IDGAF attitude

These are all traits of men who get laid a lot, and women think they should fuck. You have to fake this first. Me and you both are not the type of men to get laid a lot, we're not that hot, we don't have that cool of a  job according to society or fame or that much money. But the guys who do, and the guys who girls want, all have these attributes. The good thing is, girls feel this instinctually, so if you can fake out their instincts at first by acting like a guy who does get laid a lot, well, you get the picture. The moment a girl believes you do not have these qualities, your attractiveness diminishes. Again, to get a girl is easy enough, just go on trp and search it up and emulate what they tell you, you'll hear about shit tests, escalation, push-pull yaddi yadda, but what you need in order to keep getting laid by the same girl are those three things. Simply put, texing a specific girl for long periods of time about a subject that doesn't fucking matter diminishes these qualities because it becomes obvious you're texting her because 1, you care what she thinks and what she says, 2, you don't have anything better to do or anyone else to text. Now look at those three attributes, does acting like that align with it? No. 

So you realize you shouldn't be texting and you need more plates so you shoot your shot at several women consistently every other day. And you remembered to follow up on your kills for some other day you can hang out. Now you always have a girl you can hit up. After a while, you get to a point where there's no point in texting all of these women anyways because who has the energy to keep up with text conversations with 10+ women. Once this happens to you guess what, you become less needy, you don't care what happens when you don't text this girl, or if you say this or that to her, you ACTUALLY become outcome independent, you don't have to fake it because you ACTUALLY always have another girl you can fall back to. Women pick up on your abundance mentality and your idgaf attitude which helps maintain your attractiveness. You're experienced now you know how to handle interactions with girls so you ooze confidence, also maintaining your attractiveness. You can fucking RELAX and not text now because, with all these women on your phone who you've met with and hooked up with consistently when Saturday night comes now there's bound to be a message waiting for you, a girl invites you to her house at 12 pm to fuck, or better yet, dinner. And look at that, you didn't even have to ask her how her day was. 

Don't let your thirstiness take over this pandemic, it'll just make things worse, #stoptextingplates2020",2020-04-02 21:38:32
7,Are you stroking your ego?,0,0,0,fugmsf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/fugmsf/are_you_stroking_your_ego/,12,1585977209.0,"Edit: This post mainly goes out to the ones who frequent askTRP.

I'd advise reading my previous post 'Perception' before reading this.


First and foremost. TRP is full of men who want to cling on to their own perception in order to stroke their own ego. These men are saying to themselves that they're an alpha, why? It gives them a boost to their own ego. It feels good. You may be one of these men reading this and thinking that you don't stroke your own ego, in order to STROKE YOUR OWN EGO. Well, do you want to find out if you do or not? 




Ask yourself these questions:




- Do you repetitively delete your posts/comments on here and askTRP? 



- Do you try to justify your actions to others?



- Can you not accept being wrong?



- Do you insult others?



- Do you post and feel worried about what other members of TRP are going to say?



- Do you live your life by what other people say here by a dime?



- Do you suffer with severe cognitive dissonance about the theory of TRP?



- Do you care so much about being 'alpha'?




If you say yes to any of these. YOU'RE STROKING YOUR OWN EGO. 




Many will cling on to their perception no matter what, why? Because they're afraid of being wrong, and therefore afraid of being emotionally hurt. That's EGO. 



Few will challenge their own perception. To be fair, everyone who actively participates in TRP has challenged their own perception. But there's another hurdle, breaking free from the ""I'm so alpha"" bullshit here, ESPECIALLY in askTRP.



You need to make your own rules. At the moment, you are following rules of others who are stroking their own ego too, just like you. You are the blind being lead by the blind.



Now, it's important to remember that not ALL people in TRP are blind. Notable examples would be the mods and EC's.



Now, it's perfectly OK if you're one of these men who are blind, because it's your current perception. Your perception in the future is going to be different from now, but only if you are able to challenge your own perception, and other people's perceptions. This post is ME challenging your perception. It is vital for a person to be able to do this, as this is how they move on.



Side note: Your perception is another name for your frame.



You can control other people's perception to a certain extent, by perceiving yourself as this and that, which is fine. But you shouldn't care about their perception of you. This is what outcome independence TRULY means.



If you're worried about other people's perception of you. That means you're not being true to yourself. You're not making your own rules. You're living by other people's rules.




On to my next point:



TRP IS JUST A TOOLBOX. STOP WORSHIPPING A FUCKING TOOLBOX.


You decide what you do with the toolbox.


> What you create is up to you.


Credit to The1ndex for that quote.



People here say this for a reason, you know?




Another point:



The EC's on here are not gods, or super-ultra-mega-fucking Chads. Sure, they might have a lot of 'Chad' traits. But they also have 'beta' traits. They are human beings, just like you and me.



Speaking of EC's, I messaged Heathcliff the other day, and he explained to me that being stuck in the manosphere means that you've hit a wall in your development. You need to leave to enter the next stage of learning and understanding. He goes further mentioning the Pareto principle, from my interpretation, 80% of the men here get stuck stroking their own ego, while only 20% actually learn something.



Lessons learned:



- Stop saying that you're 'alpha'. You're seeking validation and feeding your ego.


- Stop making 'red pill' a part of your identity. TRP IS A TOOLBOX.


- Just because someone follows TRP, doesn't mean that they're a worthy source of information or advice. THIS IS WHY EC'S ARE A THING.


- Stop stroking your ego.


- When you get the message, hang up the phone. - credit to Heathcliff


- Make your own rules, and live by them.

- Stop mentally masturbating.

- Be that 20%.




- You HAVE to let go.

8,LTRs and The Food Trap,32,0,32,ftmmfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/ftmmfy/ltrs_and_the_food_trap/,33,1585864073.0,"Tag makes it obvious, but: This is a theory I've worked on for some time. It applies mostly to men in or headed for LTR.

Food is a trap.  Don't fall for it.

An LTR partner will almost always try and ""fatten you up."" But that makes me less attractive, you say. Why would she want that?

Simple: It reduces your SMV. 

As someone else said here on a recent ""Best of"" post: Validation is sex for women. Its their primary need, in terms of what they get from men. Sex itself is secondary; its the validation they are after. And having you focused solely on them, and no one else, provides them enormous amounts of validation. What they need beyond that, they will get by wearing low cut shirts to work and leaning over the cubicles of overweight office workers desperate for female attention, to make them drool a while.

Meanwhile, SMV for men is determine by a LARGE margin, by physique. Thats not the ONLY factor, but is a BIG factor. By ""fattening you up"" she is essentially taking you off the sexual market. Making it so that other women, are not even interested. 

This gives her the power. It places your existence, within her frame. Think about if: If you are off the sexual market, Dread Game is impossible. If no one wants your fat ass, she never needs to worry. The power dynamic shifts to favor her to an immense degree. But this also means you can never, ever make her tingle; if there's no risk inherent in the relationship, no dread, her hamster has basically rolled over and gone to sleep...until someone ELSE wakes it up.

Do not let her junk food fixation, become your way of life. She will try. SUbtly, at first. Desert night once per week. Then next thing you know, she's buying potato chips and ice cream on every shopping run. Maybe she knows why she does it; more probably she doesn't even understand her compulsion to fatten up her husband or long time partner. But the fact remains: The result is your removal from the sexual marketplace completely, the utter inability to use dread game, and her complete stranglehold on your sex life and the relationship as a whole.

This leads to staleness and boredom. A complete lack of emotional tingles. And we ALL know where the next step is from there. 

Food is a trap. Don't fall for it.",2020-04-02 21:47:53
