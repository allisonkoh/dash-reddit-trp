1,On the shadow-banning of Paul Elam and Dean Esmay,15,0,15,14haxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/14haxi/on_the_shadowbanning_of_paul_elam_and_dean_esmay/,265,1354964792.0,"Dear feminists, and by feminists, I mean most of you sorry cretins who inhabit r/mensrights.


Good afternoon, my name is John, some of you may be familiar with my work. This letter is hopefully clear up a few misperceptions and put to rest the concerns of many members pf this community.


Several days ago, my colleague and friend Paul was shadow banned, not by the moderators of /r/mr, but by the administration of reddit. Similarly, Dean Esmay, with whom I work at AVFM was also shadow banned. Apparently, this was due to their endorsement or public statement of support for discovering the identities and publishing the names of feminist participants and organizers of the U of T Warren Farrell protest.


I have also been told by some members of this community that stooping to the tactics of the enemy is unacceptable. Addressing this claim literally, I agree. I completely agree that censorship, intimidation, threats of death, advocating violence, initiating violence, and cultivating hate against a group based on identity or sex, s totally unacceptable. However, the criticism directed towards me used that rhetoric, but referred to my advocation of publication of identity the woman harassing a man at Warren Farrell's protest. The “you are fucking scum” woman. 


And apparently, my genuine intention to attach her public behavior to her name is seen as “stooping to the tactics of feminists”


Are you fucking kidding me?


Why do any of you dolts imagine Paul, Dean, myself and other actual MRAs advocate public exposure of the evangelists of hatred and the initiators of proxy violence? Do you think, in your pea brains we intend harm to come to the cretins we document?  A summary pass through any of our collected writing  will quickly disabuse you of that stupid assumption.


In fact the concern over the practice of outing the agents of hatred and the initiators of proxy violence is not a moral concern at all. It's fear of offending the powerful. On Reddit, that would be the feminist hegemony who seem able to indulge in any cruelty and hate with impunity – on the misguided notion that if only we in the r/mr reddit were a bit nicer, they'd come right around and embrace the undeniable reality of our concerns.


Stupid and cowardly. Thats what this concern is. 


And just in case any of you slow-witted dolts haven't got it yet, while I wont do it on reddit – respecting the rules of the house here, outside of this forum, I will publish the name of anyone – male or female, MRA or Feminist who advocates violence or initiates violence, including by proxy, and I'll do it with satisfied smile on my face, and not even a slight twinge of guilt. 


Or do you snivelers think accountability is only for men, and that women, or feminists (including feminist men) have a free licence to commit and cultivate violence and hate?




Do you think women are so fucking helpless and infantile they cannot possibly own any accountability – even in the commission of direct violence? If you /do/ think this, then you are indistinguishable from a gender ideologue, and you will have earned my unlimited contempt. How can you possibly oppose violence without supporting accountability for it's direct and proxy initiation? 


Oh, and if anybody, after reading this cares to claim that publicly identifying the initiators of violence is /actually/ a backhanded technique for putting them in harms way, then you're too stupid to be allowed to participate in an adult conversation. Yes, you too David.


Anti-feminism is the revolutionary notion that women are (like men) moral agents.


I expect I'll be getting banned on reddit directly after posting this, which will simply be the wider reddit community making itself even less relevant on the topic of the Men's Rights Movement. 


And to the Reddit Admins: Go on, ban me, and tell yourselves the violence cultivated and committed by the feminist community is harmless because it principally targets men.

Just that, rights for men. Our topics are generally about divorce laws, custody laws, equal treatment under the law, false-rape accusations, domestic violence, gender double-standards, feminist hypocrisy. 

**""I'm a feminist and actually agree with some of what is posted here and not with other parts.""**

You're cool. We have no problem with you.


**""Why is everyone so hateful to me?""**

You have an expectation of being coddled and pandered to.  When that is removed you think it is people being hateful towards you. You were just spoiled before and are having to adapt. You don't get to bully men here just because you are saying feminist things.


**""I'm a man, a feminist, and I..""**

Yes, we call you ""white knights"" and we were you once. You are just our past selves. 


**""I've been married for over two years and...""**

Awww... *pats you on the head like a cute little scamp*


**""... but feminism is about equality!""**

No. You bought into the hype:

1. Fighting sexism against women and ignoring sexism against men is not fighting for equality,

2. ""Women need more rights so there is equality"" is just playing victim, not seeking equality.


**""I have a right to post here!""**

Yes, but ask yourself why you are really in a subreddit that tries to discuss the issues of men's rights when it is not really allowed in feminist subreddits. Question your own motives. Are you really here for discussion or just to scream at us that we are wrong?


**""The patriarchy hurts everyone""**

The patriarchy is not a catch-all for all your gripes about the world. It is not the dark side of the force. It is not satan. It is a convenient excuse for feminists to avoid responsibility.

** ""No, but I really believe in equality!""**

Good. Seriously - good. However don't just say that then go back to fighting only for women. We believe in equality too.


**""You're all just a bunch of....""**

Please keep your shaming and insults to yourself. You are just stereotyping and over-generalizing based on what you already want to believe. It isn't going to stop us from talking to each other and it is just you acting on reflex. 


**""You can't seriously be saying that women aren't worse off over all""**

Yes. We are saying that. [Here is the proof](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/1033)

**""You can't seriously be saying that feminists conspire against men""**

Yes. We are saying that.  If you can't accept that, then just leave. You've been indoctrinated and are resisting breaking free of that conditioning. Think critically, question us, think for yourself - but don't just react with your pre-programmed conditioned assumptions. 


**""Well this all seems very negative and you should value our comments about...**

No. We have no shortage of feminists coming here thinking their opinions are precious. We aren't interested in fostering more feminists posting here. If, however, you insist on posting here - then please lurk and listen for a while before jumping into discussions, disagreeing angrily, and/or openly trolling.

Perhaps the cold winter winds are causing everyone's nutsacks to shrivel up. But in the last several weeks, I have seen this subreddit take a distinct turn towards PC feminist-appeasing manginaville, and I don't like it one bit.

In case you guys haven't noticed, we are a tiny group of people fighting an incredibly powerful and well-funded hate movement. This hate movement has connections in all levels of government, and has purposefully turned society against men. We are also dealing with a society full of kool-aid drinkers (men and women) who will throw their brother/father/son under the bus if they think it will help some woman, somewhere. 

I have been talking about MRA-related stuff for 17 years now. And no matter how ""nice"" i used to be, no matter how logical i tried to make my arguments, and no matter how far i went out of my way to prove my egalitarian mindset, I was always painted as the evil woman abuser simply because I wasn't a dedicated kool-aide drinker.

Eventually I realized that as a MAN, I will be called into question NO MATTER WHAT I SAY OR DO. And as an MRA, I will be hated no matter what I say or do. Therefore, I simply think there is no reason for us to be nice and accommodating to people who want us dead.

Stop making excuses for bigots and misandrists.

Stop shouting about NAWALT, when scant few women lift one fucking finger to help men.

Stop thinking we can feed Feminists ice cream cones of logic and sweetness, and they'll somehow have a revelation. They won't.

Stop questioning and criticizing every single fucking thing REAL activists at AVFM are doing. If you don't like their approach, put up your own damn advocacy site and prove to us how your way is better.

Feminism is not going to get off our backs until we stand up for ourselves. We should advocate equal opportunity for all. We should pursue a path of strict non-violence. Beyond that, it's far past time we stopped caring about the ""feelings"" of people who want us dead.",2011-12-10 11:44:42

If we look at history we find that virtually every group that has been singled out for hate and persecution has being subjected to this technique.

In Europe before world war two, the claim that jews abducted and murdered children was circulated, called blood libel.

In america, claims that black, men had a preference for raping white women were popularized.

The aim of these claims is simple: it's an attempt to make the public believe that the target group are not like them, that they are *bad by nature*. If they are bad by nature then the public can then be told to ignore everything they say without consideration. And that's what this is about: the hate group tries to stop the public considering the target groups words because they fear that the public will find merit in them, so they attempt to deny them that consideration.

I'm sure this thread will attract responses which pretend to be shocked that I've dared to compare what's happening with the plight of Jewish or black people. But as a group *we're literally being accused of being linked to a mass murder and of being complicit in it*. And in the same way, some will feign outrage at seeing me compare us to the civil rights movement, but that's what we are all about: a group who are discriminated against in the court, the university and the street, fighting for equal rights and being accused and abused in return. There is no hyperbole here.

I encourage you to stay positive through this. The hate groups targeting us are doing it because they're so terrified of what we say that they're resorting to telling everyone we're murderers to try to silence us.

A JUDGE has refused to immediately jail a young man for having sex with a 13-year-old girl saying today’s youth do not realise underage sex is a serious crime.

District Court Judge Rosemary Davey says Sasha Pierre Huerta, 21, was not a predator and his teenage victim “was looking for” a sexual encounter.

In transcripts viewed by The Advertiser, Judge Davey says teens living in our “overtly sexualised” world are ignorant of the maximum seven-year jail term for underage sex.

“Regrettably — and I don’t live in an ivory tower — that kind of criminal conduct is happening day in, day out,” she says.

“In fact, if you ask most 17-year-olds or 16-year-olds whether they know (underage sex) was an offence carrying seven years’ imprisonment, they would die with their leg in the air.

“It’s just crazy, in my view, that we maintain this law and we do not pass the message on out into the community.”

Huerta, 21, of Walkerville, pleaded guilty to one count of having sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 14 years.

He admitted that, in February this year, he had sex with the girl, 13, following an all-ages party in the city.

Huerta had met the girl earlier that month at Marble Bar, sparking sexually-explicit Facebook interactions during which she claimed she was 14 years old.

Do you think our children fully understand that underage sex is a serious crime?

In the transcript viewed by The Advertiser, the court was told the girl dressed “like a 23-year-old” and “presented herself as a woman”, attending bars and events she could not lawfully enter.

“This is a girl who was not a girl who was sitting at home just putting Barbie dolls away,” Judge Davey said.

“This is a girl who was out there wanting to party and mix with older people, who put herself out there.”

The transcript records the fact a school class was sitting in the court’s public gallery as sentencing submissions were heard.

Lawyers for Huerta said their client and the girl agreed to have sex — even though she could not lawfully consent, and he was aware of her youth — in his bed at his home.

Judge Davey said she doubted the school class in the gallery understood their burgeoning sexuality could lead to criminal charges.

“I’m not suggesting that it’s not a serious matter for a man, although he is a young man too, to have sexual intercourse with a person underage,” she said.

“I would like to do a straw poll of the young people sitting in court at the moment — I’m not going to — to find out how many of them realise it’s a serious crime to even have touching of the genital area under the age of 17.

“It’s just that I find it extraordinary that there’s never public discussion about (the fact) we have a whole generation of young people having sex ... which is a crime.”

In sentencing, Judge Davey told Huerta it was “a crazy mixed up world we live in”.

“The reason why the law is as it is, is to protect young people from themselves,” she said.

“Whilst the media and the world we live in might encourage young people to think they are in control of their bodies and their sexuality from a very young age, you know ... that with sexual development one does not necessarily have the maturity to make decisions about sexual intercourse at an early age.”

Judge Davey said Huerta’s offending was not predatory and that he was “deeply shocked, upset and contrite” about his actions.

She imposed a two-year jail term, suspended on condition of a two-year good behaviour bond.

“One of the reasons why I suspended the period of imprisonment is because I think it is most unlikely we’ll see you back here again,” she said.

“You have your whole life ahead of you. Be good.”

I started dating this girl in my senior year of University. Things hit off quickly. We spent almost every night together, and fell in love. After graduating, we both landed great jobs in the same town, and moved in together. I honestly can't describe how great things were. We had no debt, good savings, great jobs, and the relationship couldn't have been better. I knew she was the girl I wanted to marry less than a year after we started dating. My parents, who were divorced, were very outspoken about not rushing into marriage, which is why I hadn't yet proposed 3 years in.

This girl was my perfect match. We knew each other inside out, and would never get sick of one another. I would have done anything for this girl. We had tons of fun, lots of friends, and lots of money. Life was good.

If there is one area I wouldn't have described as perfect, it was our sex life. Don't get me wrong, we had great sex, but finishing was often disappointing for at least one of us. This was the problem (gets a little descriptive):

Whenever I would ""finish"" first, she would become upset and slightly frustrated. Most of us probably know the feeling of getting really close and not being able to get there, so I never really blamed her for that. Usually when this happened, she would become very self-pittying for about an hour, and we'd go to sleep on opposite sides of the bed. It's like she was deliberately trying to make me feel bad for not making sure she was taken care of. It's probably worth mentioning I'd usually offer to go down and finish her off, but that rarely had any effect. Anyways, this wouls usually last about an hour, she would calm down, and everything was always fine. 

Now, here's the flip side of the coin. Most nights I was actually able to make her come. After this happened, I'd continue, and I would say about 30% of the time, she would be in pain. i don't know how normal this is or why it happened, but I accepted it. In these instances, I'd have to stop. The difference is that, although I was usually extremely frustrated (and horny), I'd let her know that it was OK. She was usually frustrated with herself when this happened more than anything else, so I tried as best as I could to constrain my frustration and show her that she meant more to me than anything else. We'd cuddle and go to bed. 

This may not sound like a healthy sex life, I don't know, but to me it was a very minor detail in an otherwise amazing relationship. We still had lots of excellent sex, and we were both very happy with the way things were going.

So now to the night it happened. We had just gotten back from a 5 day trip to her parents' place, which meant no sex for those 5 days. When we got back, I was ready to fuck anything that moved (I was 24, and probably at my sexual peak). I had been letting her know since the night before just exactly what I was going to do to her when we got home.

So we got home, things started, and then something happened. She came first, and then started to have that very recognizable painful look on her face. Now in the past I was able to restrain my frustration in these circumstances, but this time I couldn't. I rolled off and over to my side of the bed. She could tell I was frustrated and wanted to talk about it. I obliged, and began to pour out how exactly I felt. The conversation was actually fairly well-spirited, but I was still frustrated. After a little bit, she asked me if I wanted to try and go at it again. Once more, I obliged. A few minutes in and the same thing happened, except this time, she put on clothes, stormed out of the room, and left.

I was completely shocked. I tried calling but got no answer. It was no more than 30 minutes later of constantly trying to reach her that the cops showed up. She'd told them I'd raped her.

I immediately went in to shock. It was the first time in 3 years I felt the girl of my dreams start to slip away. It seemed surreal. I felt helpless. I tried to reason with the cops (it seemed like my only option at the time), but that obviously had no effect. They took me in for questioning. I was later released on bail and moved in with my parents, but of course, with a trial pending.

For the next few months, everything just seemed like it was in a constant downhill spin. A local feminist group got hold of my girlfriend's story and came to her ""support"", although it seemed their main goal was to make my life a living hell. They found out where I worked, and it didn't take them long to make sure I was fired. At every court appearance, sure enough they were there to ridicule and taunt me for what I'd done, even though I maintained my innocence.

I considered suicide a few times. Ever since graduating, I had the perfect life planned. Get married, have kids, live the life.  I couldn't even imagine my life without her in it, or finding someone to replace her. I had no job, and even started to believe some of the things these people were telling me. I was a wreck. I was very fortunate to have a supportive family. They believed me and helped me through it, and that kept me alive.

As for the trial, I told my side of things, and her story was constantly changing, always getting closer and closer to my account, which never changed. Eventually, her story had changed so much that the judge no longer considered the event to be rape. I was acquitted, and life moved on. The feminist group was not pleased. They were convinced I was guilty and that my ex had somehow been ""emotionally manipulated into changing her story"", because apparantly she still had feelings for me. This is beside the fact that she hadn't talked to me since that fateful night. They continued to pester me and be a generally nuissance, but slowly faded away.

So now, 4 years later, I am again in a happy and trusting relationship. The best thing for me has been to realize how silly those feelings of ""I will never find someone to replace her"" were. I actually managed to find a new decent job during the trial, so yes I'm employed. I look back though, and still have no idea how I could have been so wrong or what the hell happened. She still won't talk to me (although admittedly I stopped trying long ago), and I haven't the slightest idea how things went from best to worst. To think I was going to marry this girl...

So there you have it. If you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer them.",2012-02-11 03:40:12

[Throwaway account, obviously, and TLDR at end, but I encourage all who wish to comment to read the full version.]

RAPE in AMERICA: Decade by Decade

In the 50’s and 60’s, rape was rare, and what little there was was kept hushed up, swept under the rug, and never spoken about in polite company.

In the 70’s, there was a marked increase in both the frequency and the brutality of rape, coinciding with the start of the women’s movement. Although it may not have been a coincidence, but rather the natural reaction of men unhappy with women demanding more and more rights, and wanting to “put them back in their place”. In this pre-DNA era, a rapist’s best chance of getting away with his horrible crime was to do away with the only witness/evidence in such a way that her body would not be located for an extended period of time. Countless attractive young women lost their lives to serial rapist/killers during this decade.

In the 80’s, the feminist movement doubled-down, working hard to stretch the definition of rape to include acquaintance rape, date rape, and even spousal rape. They not only insisted that these assaults be prosecuted just as vigorously and punished just as harshly as the most violent stranger-rapes, but they began demanding a lower standard of proof: A woman’s word alone, with no collaborating evidence at all, should be enough to send any man to prison forever, while new “rape shield laws” prevented him from confronting his accuser by delving into her past or questioning any contributing factors on her part that may have led the man to believe that “she wanted it.”

By the 1990’s, the new science of DNA had burst on to the scene, promising an end to the widespread scourge of unpunished rapes. But a funny thing happened on the way to ending injustice: The double-edged sword of DNA began proving—conclusively—something that most people had never even suspected: Women had been lying about rape. Frequently. And for the most trivial of reasons. Or for no reason what-so-ever. Or for reasons that were shockingly cruel and evil. And thousands of innocent me, who had been paying the price rotting in prison for crimes they didn’t commit, were now on the road to being exonerated.

By the turn of the century, actual rapists had a brand new, and rock solid defense. DNA had taken the “who-dun-it” out of rape cases, so now, every defendant’s plea became “it was consensual.” And every prosecutor’s trump cards, “women never lie about rape” or “why on Earth would she lie”? has been so thoroughly destroyed by the revelations of DNA that they dare not even utter those words in court, lest the defense bring up 1,000 counter-examples. A jury, playing by the rules, must acquit. Every time.

Now, nearly half-way through the 2010 decade, rape is more popular than ever. It’s becoming the great American pastime. Potential rapists are springing up like mushrooms, contemplating rape and prosecution, and saying “I like my odds!” while feminists are pulling their hair out (and with equal fervor, NOT pulling their hair out), making increasingly insane demands to weaken the Constitutional Rights of defendants, which even if enacted, would just result in more innocent men being punished and then exonerated, which in turn would create an even greater backlash from the jury pool.

The moral of all of this is, of course, that DNA science could have—and would have—solved the rape problem, had women been living up to their pre-supposed virtue of truthfulness. DNA + women not lying about rape = a death blow to rapists (and even the eventual elimination of the rape gene from the gene pool). Instead, feminists sought UNequal justice for women while trying to keep the power of the nuclear option of being able to falsely accuse men of rape when necessary.

So now, and in decades to come, we will surely see the day when the feminist-created, made-up statistics of “1 in 4” and “every 6 minutes” will become a reality. A reality that could have been different, had feminism truly embraced the concept of EQUAL rights, and justice for ALL.

Happy Thanksgiving. And pass me the turkey. But stick a fork in the concept of prosecuting men for Acquaintance Rape. It’s DONE.

[TL;DR 11th grade student examines the evolution rape culture from 1950's to the present and beyond, placing most of the blame on feminism and predicting rape will become more commonplace, and prosecuting rape will become pointless. I, the teacher, am having trouble deciding what grade to give. Note that I don't have to agree with the paper's conclusion to give it a good grade, but only that some compelling points were made. And in this case, the points made were unique, and not shared by any of the other papers turned in, nor, as far as I can tell, lifted from any posted internet opinions.]

>Feminism is becoming a bad word, but it's just a word. It's not really important to reclaim that word.

You're right, but it is important to differentiate [what I call feminism] from what [people here tend to call feminism]. The words, as you say, aren't really important. I was wrong to stress that they were. The reason it's important to make this distinction is that people here read all of the negative things about ""feminism"" and get a seriously misguided world-view. This world-view is

1. Harmful to our cause of men's rights activism

2. Potentially harmful to some of our relationships with women

and should therefore be refined to reflect the truth: that what we call ""feminism"" here is often just a group of anti-man, female-supriority activism. It is not the whole picture, even though it's easy to assume that it is.

This is the essence of my argument as it stands, refined by the criticisms I have received here.

----------
Another edit: if you are a newcomer to this thread and think what I'm saying is total garbage, please read the comments.

EDIT: I'm being downvoted because I'm being misunderstood. Many have made the entirely legitimate argument that **what everybody calls feminism is feminism**, and what authority do I have to say what it ""really is?"" 
First of all, this is like saying a bunch of kids who learn 4 chords on the guitar to impress their friends ""guitarists."" They can call themselves guitarists all they want, **and they would be wrong**. Perhaps ""philosopher"" is a better example: you can come up with bullshit all day about the meaning of life or whatever, but that doesn't make you a philosopher.

If you want to use ""feminism"" to describe the hateful and anti-man efforts of one group of women, then that's fine. But the links below are the real deal. The professionals. If you're still hung up on the word though, just call what I'm talking about something else!! What I'm trying to highlight is a conceptual distinction.

-----------------------------

Many of us, indignant about the disgusting assaults on the freedoms and equality of men, see ""feminism"" as the perpetrator. The reason for this is that the women (and men) who promote anti-man attitudes use this word to describe themselves--they call themselves ""feminists."" In many cases, they're wrong. 

It takes more than being anti-man to be feminist. It takes more than being *pro-woman* to be feminist. So many women who think they're feminists are just playing the vicious and self-defeating game of identity politics. Feminism is not just civil rights--it requires an appreciation of the social construction of gender, the institutional structure of oppression, and the psychological nature of the relationship between men and women. Furthermore, you're not a feminist if all you do is whine--just like you're not civil rights activist if you think black people are nice--true feminists will *act* to promote equality, and often this means going against the grain of what is standard and normative for their gender. That's why there are comparatively few actual feminists, compared to what you might first assume. 
 
Finally, people misunderstand ""equality,"" the goal of feminism. Equality does not mean equal circumstances and treatment all the time. Men and women are *biologically different*, and will always have different personalities, different desires/needs, and different roles in society. **Gender equality means that both genders are able to live their own lives to the fullest extent, freely and authentically.**

Here are some links for reference. 

http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-approaches/

en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism

Finally, in the name of good intellectual habits, if you think this is all wrong, *please say why*. I'll admit I'm wrong if it is demonstrated that I am. No issue is black and white, and I've glossed over a great deal of intricacy here. 

~~Don't ruin this word.~~ Feminism is one of the greatest achievements of modern Western society in the last fifty or so years.

I went to the gym this morning and saw this:

http://i.imgur.com/nVcRP.jpg

The gym in my building has been overly biased towards women for a while now. [1]

There tons of aerobic nautilus equipment.  There are three treadmills and four stair climbers.  All the machines are the mechanical (non-free weight).  And the only alternative if they remove the bench press is a smith machine (which have been shown to cause injuries and be less effective than the bench press).

    http://thewaronbullshit.com/2009/09/21/dangerous_exercise_machines/

The dumbells max out at 30 lbs.  There is no squat rack and originally there was NO bench press but another male in the building offered to donate one.

Further, there have been issues with the bench press before.  The incline press causes the bench to shift dangerously.  I've brought this up to the HOA only to be ignored.

I've been trying to work with our HOA for a while now and offered to by a squat rack but was ignored by the HOA for 4 months before giving up.

NOW they want to remove the LAST piece of gym equipment usable for men.  

I think part of this is that the HOA is getting bad advice but they don't seem to want to listen to any external advice other than those on the HOA board and their exercise machine vendors.

There was a gentleman at the gym who I brought this up with and he 100% agreed with me on all these issues.

I'm 90% certain they are just going to ignore me when I bring this to the attention of the HOA.  Men are 50% of the building and should receive 50% of the resources.  

1. I have NO PROBLEM sharing the gym with women.  If the situation were reversed I would fight for it to be fair for them too.

56,Best Advice You'll Ever Get,3,0,3,15exof,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/15exof/best_advice_youll_ever_get/,58,1356453283.0,"Never tell a woman you're leaving her. The woman who chopped off her husbands dick did it because 

he said he was leaving her. I worked with a woman who impaled her husband in his sleep through the cheek with a pair of scissors because he said he was leaving her the next day.

I've left many a female I lived with and the best way to go about it is to go stealth. Plan 

everything out and don't say a word. 'Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.' It's the truth, 

and for practical purposes women are basically above the law- white women especially. She can 

murder you and just claim 'abuse' like Mary Winkler did. They'll be arrested, but the punishment 

will be next to nothing, and women know this, which is why telling a woman you're leaving her is 

about the most dangerous thing you could ever do.

Last female I left was in 2006- she became psychotic and controlling after about a year- the usual- so I just started looking for another place to live, got the place, put down a deposit, took a day off while she was a work, got a Uhaul and moved everything out while she was gone. Of course she went nuts afterwards and started calling my work harassing me, and started the fake crying. I told her that she shouldn't have been such a monster of a human being, but of course she didn't learn anything as usual. She's still just a stupid bitch & the only companion suitable for her is a cat. If I had told her I was leaving there's a good chance I wouldn't be alive today.

So take my advice- NEVER tell a female you're leaving- better yet, don't even marry and move in with one in the U.S. to begin with if you have half a brain.",2012-12-25 16:34:43

59,If sexual harassment is such a problem for women why do they dress in more revealing clothing than men?,0,0,0,zweel,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/zweel/if_sexual_harassment_is_such_a_problem_for_women/,69,1347690525.0,"I got into an argument recently here on reddit with a user named felltir (perhaps this person was a troll...judging by the name, it's not an outlandish theory) but it got me to thinking about something...Feminists often claim sexual harassment is such a problem for women, and when I say harassment I am not talking about assault or rape (so those statistics which supposedly prove that assault and rape are not correlated with what women wear are a response to a straw man argument which I am not making)...In any case, feminists indeed make this claim and many women do as well.  So we have that.

Now, if you look at any woman in the subway or passing you in the street you will find that women **relative to men** wear clothing which is far more revealing than men do.  Most men wear collared shirts, a pair of gray pants or loose fitting blue jeans and shoes or boots, perhaps a jacket or an overcoat...something simple and anonymous...Women in contrast wear clothing that men would feel utterly ashamed to wear, like booty shorts and skin tight t-shirts with high sleeves (designed to show off even more skin) and women spend far more time concerned with their appearance.  Aside from rock & roll musicians, women seem to be the only ones who wear things like skin tight leather pants and short skirts...Men simply do not do this.

Now, if we put this together we have a situation where something doesn't add up.  If women were truly sexually harassed to a point where this were a major problem for them (relative to men), the market would dictate that we would find the situation to be completely the opposite...Women would be dressing in far more conservative clothing (relative to men), to ward off this truly problematic harassment.

But here we have the complete reverse taking place...We have women claiming sexual harassment is such a major problem and yet we also have women choosing of their own accord to wear far more revealing clothing.

The same is true of feminists who claim women are overly ""objectified"" and that this is problematic for women.  If it truly were problematic for women, why do they select clothing which objectifies their own bodies?

Now...before anyone straw mans me and says I'm saying women should cover up, I challenge you to point to a section of my text where I said that.  I did not say that.  My statement is simply that if sexual harassment were such a problem, relative to men, we would see women more covered up, relative to men.

The only explanation for this is that the benefits of women objectifying themselves and of women revealing skin and wearing skin tight clothing (narcissism, control over men, personal exaltation) outweighs the potential costs (harassment, such as whistling or comments)...

And anyone who thinks harassment has no correlation with how women dress is a completely deluded moron who I will not have any discussion with.  If you are so far out there that you think how a woman dresses doesn't effect her odds of being harassed you are an idiot.  

Now, I truly do believe sexual harassment is a problem for women, but perhaps it's because they are dressing in such a way as to provoke the response.

Enter sex positive feminist and their ""slut walks"", the complaint that it's not a woman's fault that she wears revealing clothing and is harassed, it's the harasser.  See, here we have an instance of feminists throwing gasoline on the flames they themselves are claiming to want to put out.

But isn't this a cryptic straw man?  It's not like preventing women from wearing overly sexual clothing and asking them to take responsibility for their actions is something which society doesn't expect of men.  If I wore booty shorts and went on the subway and I was harassed, it would be obviously because I am wearing such revealing clothing.  If you think about it, these types of slut walks are not an issue of equality...Are they fighting to be able to do something men can do and they can't?  No.  Men don't walk around in booty shorts, free of harassment.

But this is, for the most part, a free market, and it's a reflection of our values. So, if it is true that more women are being harassed than men and it is true that more women specifically choose to appear this way, it follows that whatever cost the sexual harassment has, the benefits outweigh the costs, at least relative to men.

Whatever, these were just some thoughts on my mind.  Anyone else consider this?",2012-09-15 06:28:45

Drunk and waiting for a hot pocket to cook. Still I have a few questions. Not trying to be a jerk, sincerely curious about your guys' perspectives. 

Clearly men have more rights than women, maybe you guys don't think so, I don't know... (Although I think there are obviously double standards, different ones for both men and women. Women are called sluts when they sleep around and people always act like all men are potential rapists, etc.) Anywho, I get the feeling mens rights advocates (talking about in general here, not specifically this subreddit, as I haven't extensively read it) blame their problems on women. I see this as silly. Women aren't actively working against men's rights, they're fucking oppressed as it is! **I think when men's rights are impeded upon, it is due to the same system that gets in the way of women's rights.** For example, courts overwhelmingly favor mothers when determining who kids will live with during custody/divorce cases without regard to how good a father the husband is. I don't think this is fair, but I also don't think it's  the fault of women. The same social system that says women are caring, feminine, and good nuturers also paints men as uncaring, lacking emotionally, and not responsible for they're children's development. Who do you think the judge is going to assign custody of the children to with this model of thinking?! **I think men and women are both oppressed by the same system, what do you guys think? Agree or no?**

Edit: Okay, nobody seemed to respond to my most pertinent question, so I bolded it. Like I said, I think men and women are screwed over by the same system, but in different ways. Men are supposed to be masculine as possible and dominant in order to gain access to power in society. Part of this script involves creating a story about how males are 'invincible', when in reality they are not. That's when you start to see men being ignored as a group in healthcare because they don't ""need"" it. On the other hand, as a society we have this preoccupation with taking care of women because we see them as 'weak' and in need of healthcare. I also tried to make a point earlier about the child custody. Women are viewed as caretakers, men aren't. It's only logical for someone who holds such a belief system to give custody to women (not saying it's fair). Also, someone mentioned higher arrests and whatnot for men. Again, women are viewed as weak and non-threatening. Men are viewed as the violent and powerful ones, as persons who actually are threatening and need to be put in jail. Basically, what I'm trying to point out with the above examples is that I think the disparity in treatment we see between men and women all stems from our current beliefs about the ""natural"" behaviors of men and women. I also think all of that so-called difference is pretty much utter bullshit. Men need healthcare just as much as women, men can be just as good of parents, women should be punished just as equally as their male-counterparts for committing the same crime, and so on. The thing that you guys seem to be missing the point of is that *women aren't doing this to men, men are doing it to themselves*. The president is a male. Congress is mostly male. Police officers are mostly male. Court Judges are mostly male. Most positions of power in our society are overwhelmingly held by men. Why then, are men still being denied their rights? It's because these same men are 'trying' to maintain male dominated power structures that rely on men being treated in such ways. (I don't mean consciously trying, it is just the way things are, and women are also guilty of enforcing the same systems when able to do so.) 

To the person who questions that women actually have less rights then men--you've got to be kidding me. Would you also maintain that racism is a thing of the past? While women are quite equal to men in a legal sense, that is about as equal as it gets. I think I phrased it poorly using the word ""rights,"" but women do not have near as much access to power as men. Men dominate positions of power in our society, and it is **not** because they actually deserve to be there more than women. Women get paid less than men for the doing the same jobs with the exact same qualifications. Somehow, women's work is inherently worth less then men's work. I could provide other examples, but there is no point, I am not trying to prove which sex has it worse in society. Men and women need to work together to fix a social system that has oppressed both in different ways. But really, can't anyone here see the fucking contradiction in men's lack of rights and males occupying positions of power that also cause these lack of rights?! 

Sorry. I am tired and want to go to bed, but I appreciate the replies. I hope I didn't come off as too judgey, but it really worries me when I hear people blaming feminism or women for men's lack of rights. That's bullshit. Feminism will increase rights for both men and women, any other interpretation is simply inaccurate. ",2012-12-01 10:38:50

It was horrible, Feministing now is using tragedies of UNDERAGE girls to promote misandry. Basically two girls start a fight, one of them bullies the other, the bullied one commits suicide, it's gendered bullying stand to Feministing. Which automatically would insinuate that the girl was being bullied by a boy, which wasn't the case, even the article that they quoted clearly explained that she was being bullied by another GIRL. I understand that most of these days *feminists* are just closeted misandrists, but to use the tragedies of underage people of their same gender is awful.

So I know some of you hate anything ""aggressive"" sourced from an MRA.  Well this isn't, but it's true anyway.

Seems we have posts all the time asking why feminists and MRAs can't get along.  These people don't understand that feminism is directly opposed to equality and men's rights.  But what if that were not true?  What if one day a miracle happened and every single feminist out there suddenly had a Road to Damascus experience and realised they needed to quit hating men, and spreading lies about men, and creating discrimination against men?

It wouldn't change a thing about the movement, and here's why.

As MRAs begin to get their message out, ordinary men are beginning to realise the situation of oppression that they are in.  They might not use that word but they are realising more and more that all this stuff about women being oppressed and men being assholes is all bullshit.  They are realising that it's usually men who get the shaft, not women.  Women get lifted up.  And they realise that society is lying about all this.   

What is their reaction?  They are angry.  They are going to be pissed off.  Probably they will be angry with women in general, which is bad, and misdirected, and something MRAs need to try to carefully reduce.  But certainly they will be angry at feminism, and that anger is actually accurate and the truth and will make them stronger for it.

But it does mean that feminism has to die.  Because if these men realise their situation and then see MRAs making kissy with feminists they will simply disregard the MRAs too.  Feminism's reputation is already too embedded and mixed up with women only and anti-male.  The MRAs are not well known.  If our society even tries to let feminism off the hook for all the evil it has done, men will _CORRECTLY_ see this as society being complacent still about anti-male behaviour.

They will _CORRECTLY_ see it as just one more example of how ""women"" can attack men and never get called to account.

There must be an accounting.  So EVEN IF every feminist suddenly stopped hating men their movement must be destroyed (publicly repudiated and called a hate movement) so that men and young men especially can see this and be satisfied that finally there has been an accounting.  Only then can they accept that society is maybe changing.

And frankly?  If any feminist ever really did change then **they would be the first to say this** and understand that they cannot change their ways and stay within the feminist movement.  **Any time you see a feminist who claims to ""get it"" about men but is still a feminist -- they don't get it**.  They don't get it and they think their crimes and the crimes of their movement are very minor at worst and can be swept under the rug and get back to business as usual.  They are more interested in saving their own skin than in addressing the inequalities they created.

I think it's a good analogy, so I'm posting it here instead.

___

Basically, in a conversation regarding drunk people fucking, and men being de facto ""rapists"", a feminist questioned why any man would be willing to have sex with any woman who said anything other than ""YES YES PLEASE!"", and insinuated that she was shocked that so many men would admit that they're basically rapists.

I'm not linking to it, lest I be accused of inviting in a ""downvote brigade"".

___

You like chocolate, right?  Of course you do, everyone does.  If someone offered you some chocolate, you would eat it, right?  Would you only eat it if that person were manic and virtually shoving the chocolate in your face as they screamed ""EAT EAT PLEASE!!!""?  What if they opened up the box of chocolate, and only reluctantly offered it to you?  Would you turn it down?  What if you asked for the chocolate, and they just opened the box, and motioned for you to take some, but didn't seem to give a fuck?  Would you refuse that chocolate because they weren't ridiculously enthusiastic about you eating some?  What if you met them at a bar, and the two of you were drinking, but they were REALLY enthusiastic about it all?

Now, imagine your desire for that chocolate is MUCH stronger.  In fact, it's foundational to nearly everything about you...and your gender.  Imagine simply hearing or seeing things somehow *related* to chocolate, can stir up a hunger within you equivalent to the hunger of a starving person who hasn't eaten a real meal in years.  Of course, as you mature, your desire for chocolate gets more subdued and nuanced, but when you're younger, especially when you just start eating chocolate, the desire for chocolate can be pretty extreme, and can undermine your judgment.

Add to that a society which has all sorts of rules, regulations, and social conventions surrounding how chocolate should be eaten and procured.  Most of them make sense to you...don't accept chocolate from a kid, don't steal it from people, don't coerce people into ""giving"" you chocolate against their will.  But some of them are asinine: you shouldn't eat chocolate with socks on, you shouldn't directly ask for chocolate, men shouldn't share chocolate, etc.  More than that, now you have some people called chocolatists who want even stricter rules.  They tell you that you're basically a criminal who should be locked up because you would accept chocolate from someone who offered it to you when you were both drunk.  They insinuate that you're responsible for the other person's actions AND your own, but that they're not responsible for any actions whatsoever.  They claim it has to do with someone being drunk and being incapable of giving consent to chocolate-sharing.  But in the hypothetical situation, you're both drunk...and they're only blaming you.  When you point out that you disagree, they start insisting that, because you say you *would* accept chocolate even if the person wasn't jumping around like an idiot trying to shove it in your face, you're a horrible person, on par with those who steal someone's chocolate when they're passed out...or those who beat people up to take their chocolate, etc.

A long time ago, some religious people passed laws making it illegal for people to buy chocolate.  Most reasonable people now seem to agree that two consenting adults should be able to sell and buy chocolate from one another...but many of the chocolatists do not.  In fact, they equate buying chocolate with kidnapping people, abusing them, and forcing them to sell chocolate for you under threat of death.  They ignore all the people who currently sell chocolate (illegally) without being coerced, etc.  Aside from that, some chocolatists actually try to outlaw DEPICTIONS of chocolate.  They claim it's also on par with forcing people to sell chocolate against their will, etc.  More than that, many chocolatists also fight for crazy laws...laws which throw out the presumption of innocence (the bedrock of our entire legal system) when chocolate-theft is alleged.  

The thing is, in this world, only gender-A has a natural source of chocolate...gender-B must procure it from gender-A.  So when they fight for some of these crazy laws, they actually fight for legislative gender-inequality.   You look into a lot of their literature...and see much of it holds up gender-A as being inherently superior, but also perpetually victimized, and it holds up gender-B as being inherently inferior, but also perpetually victimizing.  It looks sexist to you...so you call it sexism.  But they have an answer to that.  Instead of denying the idea that they're bigoted against gender-B, they point you to a special definition of ""[sexism](https://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/category/gender/sexism/)"" they're written, which claims it's impossible for gender-A to be sexist against gender-B, but not the other way around...that's right, their definition of sexism is, itself, sexist.

So you facepalm and walk away...unsure of how people could be THIS far off base.  The most fucked up thing of all?  Chocolatism has been embraced, at least superficially, by the mainstream.  These people are actually respected by your society...at least superficially (i.e. people pay them lip-service out of fear).",2011-08-15 20:26:51

Some background, I'm a 22 year old male who has sex with women living in a large progressive non-anglophone city outside of the United States.

- I have never been on a date and been expected to pay.
- No one I have had a relationship with has ever expected expensive gifts from me.
- I have one friend who knocked up a woman at a drunken party. He easily gained custody of the child when he found out the woman was an unfit mother by showing the court pictures of her smoking and drinking while pregnant.
- I don't know any women who string along male friends with the promise of sex. Ie, I've never been 'friendzoned' and haven't seen it happen.
- I don't know any women who expect preferential treatment on the basis of their sex.
- I've never been made to feel particularly demonized for being male. I've been made aware that my advances were unwelcome, that's about the extent of it.
- Neither I nor anyone I know has ever been the victim of a false rape accusation.
- I've never felt that women cheat significantly more than men
- I have never experienced anything approaching institutional misandry
- I've never been made to feel 'disposable'
- Pre-nuptial agreements are extremely commonplace where I live
- I have never been belittled for being a promiscuous male
- I have never been in any situation where it appeared that a female employee was unfit to do her job and was only there because she was a woman
- I've never been made to feel as though I did not have a voice when it comes to gender issues, although I have been told that an event I had planned on attending was women-only, which I have no problem with
- I've never been made to feel as though I was not equal to a female peer

",0,0,0,iytoo,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/iytoo/throwaway_account_long_time_lurker_and/,43,1311591104.0,"Wrote this essay previously, in a fit of frustration with what I see in the West, so I've copied and pasted. Hope that's ok.

For all the talk about “girl power” and “women kicking ass” which you see on movies these days, if the men of your “tribe” are too weak or demoralised to protect you, you will be enslaved and crushed by the men from other “tribes” before you can say “Vagina Monologues”. Which means that if you break down men’s masculinity, their willingness and ability to defend themselves and their families, you destroy the country. That’s exactly what Western women have done for the last forty years. ….

The male protective instinct doesn’t take action because Scandinavian women have worked tirelessly to eradicate it, together with everything else that smacks of traditional masculinity. Because of this feminism has greatly weakened  Western civilisation as whole. …

Didn’t feminists always claim that the world would be a better place with women in the driver’s seat, because they wouldn’t sacrifice their own children? Well, isn’t that exactly what they are doing now? 

Misandry, the hatred of men, isn’t necessarily less prevalent than misogyny, the hatred of women. The difference is that the former is much more socially acceptable.

If all oppression comes from Western men, it becomes logical to try weakening them as much as possible. If you do, a paradise of peace and equality awaits us at the other side of the rainbow. Well congratulations to Western women. You’ve succeeded in harassing and ridiculing your own sons into suppressing many of their masculine instincts. To your surprise, you didn’t enter a feminist Nirvana, but paved the way for an unfolding hell. ….

Feminists claim that the reason why women haven’t been as numerous in politics and science as men is due to male oppression of women. Some of this is true. But it is not the whole story. Being male means having to prove something, to achieve something, in a greater way than it does for women. In addition to this, the responsibility for child rearing will always fall more heavily on women than on men. ….

it was in fact the women who started this whole “single is best” culture that now permeates much of the West. Since women initiate most divorces and a divorce can potentially mean financial ruin for a man, it shouldn’t really be too surprising that many men hesitate to get involved at all. … At the same time, women during the past few decades have made it a lot easier to have a girlfriend without getting married. So women make it riskier to get married and easier to stay unmarried, and then they wonder why men “won’t commit?” Maybe too many women didn’t think all this feminism stuff quite through before jumping on the bandwagon? …..

The elaborate welfare state model in the West is frequently labelled as “the nanny state,” but perhaps it could also be named “the husband state.” Why? Well, in a traditional society, the role of men and husbands is to physically protect and financially provide for their women. In our modern society, part of this task has simply been “outsourced” to the state, which helps explain why women in general give a disproportionate support to high taxation and pro-welfare state parties. The state has simply become a substitute husband, upheld by taxation of their ex-husbands. ….

Radical feminism has bred suspicion and hostility, not cooperation. And what’s more, it has no in any way eradicated the basic sexual attraction between feminine women and masculine men. If people do not find this in their own country, they travel to another country or culture to find it, which in our age of globalisation is easier than ever. A striking number of Western men find their wives in East Asia, Latin America or other nations with a more traditional view of femininity, and a number of women find partners from more conservative countries. …

radical feminism has been one of the most important causes of the current weakness of Western civilisation, both culturally and demographically. Feminists, often with a Marxist world view, have been a crucial component in establishing the suffocating public censorship of Political Correctness in Western nations. They have also severely weakened the Western family structure, and contributed to making the West too soft and self-loathing …

Well, after two generations of Second Wave Feminism, Ms. Willis and Ms. Beauvoir have had their way: The West has skyrocketing divorce rates and plummeting birth rates, leading to a cultural and demographic vacuum. And feminists still aren’t satisfied. ….

Feminists claim that women have been victims of men, that men have oppressed women for centuries and that the sexes are equal. Denying this will result in the smears “misogynist” and “male chauvinist pig”. But equalising the sexes has led to a crippling feminisation of Western society … portraying women as oppressed victims and the equals of males is one example of how the pursuit of equality is being used to destroy our society and undermine – and therefore be in conflict with – Mother nature. ….

Married for 5 years.

The ""other"" woman is someone I knew a decade+ ago and was in love with for two+ years (unrequited at the time). Always had feelings for her. More than anyone I've ever known. 

Wife is not a bad person. She's not the ""bitch"" type.  Really don't want to hurt her. But at this point my feelings toward her are intense indifference. It's been that way since before ""Other"" came back into my life.

There's been no sex- purely emotional, she's just someone I adore and love spending time with.

Firstly, let's talk about NAFALT.  It's rhetoric.  Of course not all feminists are fire-breathing monsters like Big Red.  But they are all still deluded into thinking feminism is still necessary and has anything to do with humanism.  

There are laws protecting women from unfair treatment in the workplace and proper treatment of women is now ubiquitous corporate policy.  The wage gap now favors women as does the education gap.  Women are snatching up expensive STEM education hand-over-fist (and pissing it down their legs, incidentally.)  And the courts both criminal and family think they are all innocent angels incapable of doing any wrong.  So they won.  They got what they wanted.  They are obsolete. 

 So at this point the only purpose of feminism is about getting more agency and privilege.  And I tell ya, if you think giving one group undeserved privileges doesn't compromise the rights of another group then you deserve what's coming to by way of your precious ""true feminism.""

So think about what you're supporting when you support a ""true"" feminist.  

*here comes the brigade!*  The interest you people show in what we say and think only demonstrates how little faith you have in your own belief systems. If you had confidence in your own dogmas you wouldn't feel so threatened by our ideas. ",2013-12-24 13:31:41

I wanted give a quick update to everyone who offered me advice. To everyone who thinks I'm a troll, you can all go fuck yourselves.

The thought of jail was too terrifying for me and I decided I was going to meet up with my girlfriend and string her along just long enough to avoid having her press charges.

Yesterday morning though, the police showed up at my apartment and arrested me. My gf told me she would wait until yesterday to give me enough time to decide before she called the cops, but I guess I shouldn't be surprised she screwed me over.

On my way out, I could see the police were talking to my neighbor. I have very thin walls and I'm terrified about what my neighbor might have heard.

I spent the night in jail, the worst nightmare I could ever imagine and the one thing I wanted to avoid more than anything else. I have a (male, thank god) public defender and my parents posted bail.

My mom isn't speaking with me. My dad says he is very disappointed in me. I could barely hold back my rage at them. I tried explaining how my girlfriend tried to IMPREGNATE herself against my will. How I had taken extreme (though justifiable) measures to stop this injustice, but they're so blinded by fucked up gender equality beliefs that they are turning against me, their own son.

Oh, also when I got home today I found an email from a summer job I really wanted saying I didn't get it. Is it related to this? Did my gf tell them I was arrested? I can't prove it, but I'm suspicious as hell.

I feel fucking destroyed reddit. My entire life is ruined by this lunatic and every single fucking person is against me. I'm hopeless for the first time in my life.

I'll never trust another person I date. I'm flushing every condom, I'm only using spermicidal lube. I'm even considering getting a vasectomy. 

I don't care if you believe me or not, I'm ready to accept I'm worthless garbage to society. To everyone who supported me, thank you, it means a lot. To everyone else, keep laughing and destroying me. Everything is so bleak, I just don't care how much you hate me.
